[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.720]   The show that covers your weekly tech.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.560]   Jones, really.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.720]   I mean, this is the idea is you watch this show
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.240]   and you will no longer have any interest in tech news
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.960]   for six days.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.680]   And then you'll come back here on another Sunday,
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120]   starting from my left-rafe needleman.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.960]   Where are you?
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.880]   Are you seeing that still?
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.920]   I'm still seeing it.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.600]   OK, just check it.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.520]   Jeff, as far as I know.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.200]   What is your title that's seen it?
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.320]   Editor at large.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.280]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.440]   I don't know what that means.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.960]   It's a bunch of new books.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.480]   Which one?
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.480]   I have five.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.080]   OK.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.400]   It goes all the way up, though, right?
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.480]   To Les Moonves at the tippity top.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.440]   He's very very--
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.400]   She could have meant Les Moonves.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.320]   I did speak to him every now and again.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.640]   I forgot him all the way down.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.480]   And many bosses.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.960]   It's smart, dude.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.800]   Anybody works at seeing that.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.600]   Well, it's good to have you, Rafe.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.400]   Good to be here.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.920]   Thank you.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.160]   My friend Kevin Rose is also here, the founder of Milk.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.520]   Milk.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.800]   M-I-DOT-L-K.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.320]   Yes.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.720]   What is L-K?
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.480]   That is Sri Lanka.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.320]   Sri Lanka.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.160]   Wow.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.120]   It was short and--
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.960]   No, it's good.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.760]   M-I-DOT-L-K.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.080]   And Wink is out.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.880]   Your first product.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.200]   Once that here a couple weeks ago, 15 days goes on.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.920]   I like Wink a lot.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.320]   Thank you.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.400]   You played with it quite a bit.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.680]   And is it really David Prager going--
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.120]   Yes.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.920]   OK, just checking.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.600]   It's so annoying.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.120]   It's a bit more than a big budget for--
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.800]   No, it sounded just like a big sound.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.360]   David does an excellent pig.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   I was very impressed.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.640]   So it's going well?
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.440]   I mean, I was actually kind of shocked at how many downloads
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.240]   we had so far.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.840]   And it's been--
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.560]   I love it.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.440]   I really, I really actually enjoy it.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.600]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.080]   You're Rafe Play.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.480]   It's kind of like, like, four square, you would check in
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.720]   to a place.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.440]   Wink, you say, this place has great muffins.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.920]   Right.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.960]   And you'd rate the muffins.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.280]   And then you could compare that muffin to all the muffins
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.760]   in that city.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.120]   Oh, really?
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.400]   There's a cross muffin comparator?
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.760]   Exactly.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.800]   So it takes one object and compares it against another.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.640]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.280]   That's neat.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.780]   It's pretty cool.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.480]   I haven't seen that part yet.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.240]   I'll show you it somewhere.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.960]   We'll do a little demo.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.480]   Also here Mike Elgin, Mr. Google+, you don't work for Google
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.120]  +, but you should.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.360]   You don't get paid.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.400]   Plus, I certainly help them a little bit.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.120]   You certainly spend a lot of time there.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.480]   That's where your newsletter originates.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   Of course, Computer World is the place where--
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.360]   do you say they still do paper edition?
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.880]   I think so.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.080]   I don't get involved in the paper edition.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.440]   So you're just the online on--
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.160]   I'm also on Cultomac, Datimation, like--
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.600]   Yeah, I've been reading your Cultomac comms.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.280]   Is that something new?
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.640]   You've been doing a lot of stuff there.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.720]   But I really enjoy that.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.840]   You're quoting them a lot.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.080]   You probably-- your ears are burning, because I'm always
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.520]   saying, Mike Elgin told me--
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.320]   My eyes are burning too, because I watch it.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.840]   I watch it.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.320]   I watch your shows.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.960]   If your eyes are burning, consult a doctor.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.480]   Speaking of consulting a doctor, Cara Swisher is here.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.680]   And in good health, and we're so happy to hear that.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.160]   Thank you.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.280]   We were a little worried, Cara, from All Things D.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.320]   She was at All Things D Asia.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.960]   Asia D.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.000]   Asia D.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.120]   And had a little temporary-- temporal ischemic attack.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.280]   No, it was a stroke.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.640]   OK.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   I had a stroke.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.560]   Don't be scared of the word.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.480]   Not a TIA.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.400]   It was, technically, but not the average.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.200]   Scary.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.520]   Most TIA's are strokes.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.200]   They just don't have an MRI.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.480]   People don't do MRIs when they have these TIs,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.400]   because they're so small.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.960]   But it's good you got an MRI.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   Yes.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.880]   You got great care.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.400]   Great care.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.480]   You felt better quickly.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.800]   Yes.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.440]   You were blogging within minutes, I think.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.840]   Yes, indeed.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.600]   I couldn't believe how fast you were writing again.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.440]   Yes, during it, actually.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.320]   But you did miss, unfortunately, you missed the stage stuff.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.560]   Yes, I did, but my fantastic staff, Ina Fried and Peter Kafka
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.440]   filled in for me.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.000]   And Walt, of course, was on stage.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.680]   And they did a great job.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.720]   It shows that I'm completely not completely dispensable,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.120]   which is great.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.840]   That's bad.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.800]   No, it's good to know.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.480]   I don't want to know that.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.920]   My grandmother used to say that the graveyards are
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.680]   full of indispensable people.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.920]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.880]   Well, it's so good to see you and have you back.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.400]   I'm very well.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.360]   It was the shortest stroke in history.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.360]   Glad you're glad you're feeling--
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.440]   you know, short stroke's probably better than a long stroke.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.840]   That's true.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.600]   But no stroke is a good one.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.640]   You can make a joke, it's OK.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.680]   It's fine.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.640]   There's many jokes.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.200]   I can do my kids now.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.520]   Don't give me another stroke.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.440]   I can really mean it.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.320]   Oh, that's mother material.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.760]   That's power.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.240]   I do not do that to my poor children.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.360]   That is power.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.440]   I love that.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.640]   So it was Internet censorship day on Thursday.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.120]   I hope you all called your Congress critters
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.880]   to complain about-- in the house it was SOPA.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.200]   And in the Senate, it was IP protect.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.960]   IP protect.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   IP protect.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   IP protect.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.480]   Protect IP.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.280]   Protect IP.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.280]   Yes.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.360]   I'm hoping that one person on this panel
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.440]   will argue in favor of these measures.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.160]   You know, I had this guy--
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.320]   There are some people who say, well, the guy
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.760]   in charge of the RIAA said it's not as bad as you think.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.160]   Well, I had Mitch Glaser on my show.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.680]   Oh, Mitch?
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.360]   On the round table.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.880]   OK.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.520]   And he made a compelling case.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.960]   Of course, he's been-- that's his job.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   This is his only job.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.240]   As I could tell, is to have the lines to make the case.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.240]   Stop Internet Piracy Act.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.360]   And IP protect.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.480]   Both protect IP.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.840]   Both do essentially the same thing,
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.640]   which gives the government the right to break DNS
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.400]   if a site is a pirate site.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.080]   What they do is they give the DNS companies
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.680]   have to subscribe to this list of bans.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.400]   A black hole.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.840]   And then if a site comes up on that,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.960]   they have to make the DNS not refer to it.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.000]   That becomes illegal to refer to a site that
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.680]   is on the black list.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.480]   It's a federal offense to resolve that IP address.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.360]   It is a federal offense to give anybody a direct link
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.520]   to one of these sites.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.240]   And that just caps a wrap up DNS.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.280]   It also means you can't publish a list of physical IP addresses,
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.480]   a printed list, and a hand it out.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.440]   That would also be illegal.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.320]   It would be also, in some versions,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.880]   illegal to circumvent using proxy.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.320]   They want the ISPs to assist.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.720]   And they're looking to web hosting companies
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.480]   to be a little bit more assiduous in preventing
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.200]   copyright and materials from being on those sites.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.320]   Then we're really putting the responsibility in their hands.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.400]   Well, there are two businesses that get wrapped up
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.760]   as the enforcement arm of this.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.000]   And one is the web host.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.720]   Like you said, I mean, anybody, Twitter, anybody who has links.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.400]   That's what's scary.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.520]   Could get wrapped into it.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.400]   And then the backbone of the internet, the DNS,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.640]   which would make the United States internet different.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.040]   It'd be like China or Iran, where the internet that we see
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.120]   is different from the internet.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.440]   Everybody else is because the DNS is under the control
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.600]   of some government arm.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.440]   Is that the chief complaint against this?
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.040]   Is that it changes how internet works?
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.240]   Is it the fear that--
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.600]   No, I don't-- content companies will be overly aggressive
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.760]   in pursuing companies?
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.400]   What is the--
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.600]   Well, like the DMCA-- and I'm going to start throwing these letters
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   around and start getting them wrong probably--
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.720]   like the DMCA, some of this isn't necessarily legal,
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.840]   requires a warrant.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.240]   So companies make a--
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.840]   That's the issue.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.440]   There's no due process.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.000]   That becomes a big issue.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.080]   The issue of due process is the main one.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.080]   Right.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.560]   Because so commercial interests can basically--
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.240]   the argument goes, end up taking a site down
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.440]   by poisoning the DNS-- by having it poisoned out
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.600]   of the DNS system.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.360]   The guys at the RIAAA will say, no, that's not the case.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.720]   But that is the main complaint, I think.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.520]   Microsoft's position on SOPA, no comment.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.040]   They did support the Protect IP Act.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.280]   Apple and the Business Software Alliance and others supported.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.400]   Are they time to do domains?
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.680]   Are they time to do IPs?
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.880]   Like, how are they actually going to stop this?
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.440]   Well, I think what they do is they say,
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.120]   if you search for a domain and it has--
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.080]   offending IP addresses the result,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.600]   you will get either nothing or, in some cases,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.760]   you will get a site that says, piracy is very bad.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.880]   But can't they just-- I mean, pirates
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.080]   can swap their IPs out in 30 seconds and have a new IP.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.720]   And then all of a sudden, another one gets added to the list.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.040]   And does the old one come off?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.160]   And it's just an amen.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.200]   Exactly.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.160]   And the poor hosting company, the innocent hosting company,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.360]   you just put up this site, gets taken down completely.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.440]   Although, again, the guy from the RIAAA says, actually,
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.640]   it's the page that becomes illegal,
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.000]   that page has been taken online.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.400]   That's not going to-- you know, you run sites.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.640]   You know that's how impossible that's going to be to manage.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.080]   So a number of sites, including my sites, personal sites,
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.280]   not Twitch, but my personal sites
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.040]   had popped up on Thursday, Internet censorship day.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.960]   This site would be blocked.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   It could be blocked.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.720]   This is what you could see.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.120]   Call your member of Congress.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.280]   Tumblr did an amazing thing.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.880]   They got 87,000 calls to Congress.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.960]   The average calling, 53 seconds.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.680]   The longest call, 31 minutes.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.760]   I wouldn't want to be on the other end of that one.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.040]   1,293 hours talking to representatives.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.440]   That is amazing.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.600]   Good for Tumblr.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.280]   And I understand why Tumblr would be worried,
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.000]   because there's a ton of a fringing
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.200]   content on Tumblr, right?
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.560]   And a ton of great content on Tumblr.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.720]   Should we defend Tumblr?
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.280]   This is the thing.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.000]   I'm trying to find somebody who's going to say, well,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   wait a minute.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.400]   Maybe I'll say it.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.080]   piracy's bad.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.560]   It costs everybody.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.200]   Shouldn't we do something to protect
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.640]   intellectual property?
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.400]   Is there something so wrong with this?
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.240]   This particular method is wrong.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.960]   But no, of course you should protect--
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.360]   go after all kinds of things, but this way is kind of
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.800]   ridiculous.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.360]   The thing that I don't like about it is that essentially
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.120]   the fear is that offshore companies that are outside
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.760]   the jurisdiction of the US government
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.160]   will be doing all these things.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.360]   And they are unreachable, essentially.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.040]   And so let's strangle the throats that are available.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.520]   Right.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.680]   Companies that are in the use put the burden on them,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.600]   create potential security problems for them,
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.200]   create all these workload problems,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.800]   and essentially change the way the internet has
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.840]   functioned before, which is that people who are just
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.000]   conduits for content are not liable for that content.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.120]   Now they're switching it around and saying, OK, well,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   you have to do something about content that somebody said
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.480]   is pirated content.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.880]   That's a shift in the traditional approach
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.400]   that the US government, not the Chinese or the Iranian
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.960]   governments, the US government has taken toward the internet.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.160]   It's a bad trend.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.240]   And for the most part, most of the defenders are saying,
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.200]   well, probably nothing's going to happen in real life.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.640]   And that may or may not be true, but that's not how laws are
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.440]   supposed to work.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.400]   It's not supposed to be a situation where we trust us.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.960]   I mean, someone just on the thing very smartly said,
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.800]   it's like burning down a building to get rid of termites.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   And it's, you know.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.560]   Mel Watt, Democrat North Carolina Judiciary Committee
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.080]   hearing earlier this week, they had the hearing on Thursday,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.760]   says, beyond troubling to hear hyperbolic charges
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.840]   that this bill will open the floodgates to government
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.680]   censorship.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.680]   It's a long way.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.920]   Yeah, I love trusting those politicians, the internet stuff.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.200]   They've always been-- you know, it goes back to--
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.760]   it goes back.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.160]   And I used to be at the Washington Post.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.520]   It's the same business they like to make noise about.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.240]   And then they settle down.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.640]   The bigger picture is that every new technological change,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.840]   there's a power grab by officials and governments.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.680]   Let me give you one example that sounds completely unrelated.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.760]   Used to be 100 years ago, and the police
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.320]   would interrogate someone.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.080]   There were no cameras, no microphones running.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.240]   We know they're cameras now, and we'll talk about that in a bit.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.000]   Only for the other side.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.680]   See, now that there's cameras, the law enforcement agencies
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.400]   have reserved for themselves the right to record interrogations.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.440]   But they don't let you do it.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:34.800]   No.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.080]   So they've seized on the development
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.240]   of this new technology to change the balance of power
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.000]   between suspects and the police.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.760]   And this happens every time there's new technology.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.000]   And this is another example of that,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.280]   where there's new technology, there's the internet.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.360]   People can pirate content now and distribute it globally.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:59.880]   And so this provision in this House bill is a grab at--
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.680]   A grab from the big media companies.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:01.680]   Exactly.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.240]   The US-based media companies.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   Exactly.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.320]   Using their paid hench men and women to progress.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.880]   One of the great things about SOPA, according to Larry Downs,
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.480]   is that part of the bill is a study
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.000]   to figure out how much piracy is actually costing us.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.800]   It's funding.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.880]   The bill funds that.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.560]   So we don't actually-- the answer, they ask that question.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.440]   We don't know.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.040]   We don't know.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.920]   We're going to find out how much piracy actually
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.080]   after we pass a bill against it.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.480]   I already doubt the results, because what they're going to say--
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.240]   Of course, they have to--
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.480]   The value of what was taken is equivalent to what
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.160]   would have been sold.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.880]   They could have dealt with this so much--
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.840]   They can't deal with this many years ago
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.920]   if they hadn't been so onerous in releasing stuff digitally.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.280]   I mean, they taught a generation of people to steal,
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.120]   really.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.560]   And I know that it's unfortunate for them,
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.160]   but I used to cover them all the time.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.640]   And they had the same-- they just wanted the internet to stop.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.840]   I remember after the Web 1.0 thing sort of collapsed,
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.240]   I had a pretty prominent media executive said to me,
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.640]   oh, thank goodness, that's over.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.760]   And I met the internet.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.720]   The internet, I was like, it's not.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   It's about to get started.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.560]   It was just--
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.720]   Well, remember when-- we're coming up on Black Friday.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.840]   Remember when the Black Friday ad sites popped up
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.920]   and retailers sued them saying, you're
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.720]   publishing our coupon information prior to Black Friday.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.960]   This is going to kill us because people will know
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.280]   where the best deal is.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.800]   And that's going to put us out of business.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.320]   Fortunately, they've kind of wised up.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.120]   But this happens every time, doesn't it?
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.200]   That the rights holders, the people in power,
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.120]   the people who say, god, the internet's going to kill us.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.680]   We see our stuff getting stolen on lots of sites.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.760]   All things deep.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.800]   All things-- all the time.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.320]   We see, oh, look, here's the entire all things
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:33.840]   these sites.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.680]   I'm sure Mike, you have the same experience.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.200]   You know, it's not something we like,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.720]   but it's also not something we're going to attach every--
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.680]   At the end of the world.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   We're going to shoot everyone for the problems of--
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.560]   In fact, you can make a case of giving stuff away
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.800]   is a good way to promote the stuff that's paid.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.720]   It's a bit.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.920]   It's just you have to have this--
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.520]   The ideas I always say in a lot of these meetings
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.320]   is the kids seem to love this internet thing.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.920]   So you might want to get on board.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.440]   And they're like, oh, no, no, no.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.840]   Really, the kids love it.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.400]   It's done.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.480]   And so I think it's just a question of how--
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.880]   they certainly come a long way.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.280]   I mean, the things you could get now
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.760]   are available on streaming.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.080]   I mean, I now use Roku.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.640]   I've got Apple TV.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.560]   Well, that's another problem.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.240]   Cord cutters are going to kill Comcast.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.920]   Well, I haven't used cable.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.600]   The cable town is not happy.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.960]   Well, I still use cable.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.640]   I mean, law and order is still not on the internet.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.480]   And you need the internet.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.280]   The problem is you're buying the bits wholesale now.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.920]   And I spend a lot of money, actually.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.840]   So maybe we can declare a minor victory.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.920]   Ron Wyden in the Senate has--
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.680]   he's a Democrat from Oregon, has placed a hold
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.760]   on the Senate version of the bill.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.440]   And in--
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.760]   It's not going through.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.600]   It's not going to happen.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.280]   It's in--
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.200]   Yeah, Pelosi's on it.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.600]   The other--
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.240]   It's in committee.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.800]   Even Darryl Isa, who's a Republican from California,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.680]   says the bill is extreme and will die on the House floor.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.040]   He told Don Reisinger on CNN.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.120]   I don't believe this bill has any chance on the House floor.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.440]   It's way too extreme.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.800]   And it fringes on too many areas that our leadership
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   will know--
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.280]   thank god, we have leadership--
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.120]   that our leadership will know is simply too dangerous
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.520]   in its current form.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.360]   So was this a tempest in a teapot?
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.320]   Or is there really a threat?
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.160]   I mean, this is not the first time IAP protect.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.240]   There was Kawika.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.200]   This is a guacamole.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.320]   I mean, it keeps happening again and again.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.320]   It will keep happening.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.440]   And it will keep happening.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.200]   And you have to remain--
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.640]   They won't pass it.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.640]   They won't pass it.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.200]   The tech companies now have two good lobbies themselves.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.240]   They're starting to really--
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.440]   The House does this at all.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.160]   The House does this a lot more than the Senate.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.680]   They throw stuff in there and like,
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.640]   hey, what if it passes?
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.760]   Wow, would not be great?
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.120]   These are the same guys who declared pizza and French fries
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.600]   as vegetables this week.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.840]   Because pizza has tomato sauce.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.320]   Exactly.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.680]   So argument out of the '80s.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   No, no.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.840]   Reagan's saying lunch-- the school lunch is that ketchup.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.360]   So it's back, baby.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:36.960]   Well, good.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.720]   I'm glad I think we can declare victory on this.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.640]   I think one other thing-- it's not just the internet companies.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.680]   I think that voters are a little more aware.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.240]   And I think that that campaign, that internet-wide campaign,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.000]   to stop censorship is probably pretty infected.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.480]   Well, back to your point about Tempest and the teapot.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.040]   I think it was the Tempest that shuts this down.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.120]   I mean, we really need to have the kind of response
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.520]   that the public had over this in order to shut these down.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.920]   Because without it, it would have just possibly sailed through
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.560]   and become the law of the land.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.240]   With people who have woken up, thank goodness.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.360]   That's a good thing.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.080]   Like kids love it.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.120]   And the kids-- well, you were talking about cameras.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.800]   We're going to take a break, but I want to talk a little bit
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.480]   about the UC Davis thing, because that's interesting.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.760]   I mean, there are cameras everywhere now,
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.840]   and they're not just in the hands of law enforcement.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.160]   Why do the police keep doing these things?
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.760]   Do they not see the 50 cameras that are pointing out?
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.800]   Well, that scares me a little bit.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.440]   Maybe they're going to wise up and do it in the dark from now on.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.040]   It's almost like they have to be on the side of the protesters,
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.160]   because nothing helps the movement more than spray-painting
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   some sophomore in the face with the pepper spray.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.640]   Talk about that just a bit.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.200]   You know what I'm going to bring with me, my clipboard?
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.040]   So you're going to have to tell me, Eileen, what fine sponsor
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.280]   we're talking about today.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.160]   Well, first up is our fabulous sponsor, Go To Me Me.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.840]   How did I know?
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.920]   Go To Meeting from Citrix?
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.560]   Of course it is.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.140]   If you have tried to have a meeting with your far-flung
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.100]   colleagues and clients, you know that nowadays we
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.840]   live in a global world, and it's so hard, global world.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.560]   That's kind of redundant, isn't it?
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   We live in a global business environment,
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.160]   and it's so hard to gather people together,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.520]   especially for an impromptu meeting.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.760]   But even just for that weekly staff report,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.200]   this is Go To Meeting for years.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.120]   I've used it as a really effective way
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.200]   to get these meetings done.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.560]   First of all, easy to start a meeting.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.720]   You click a button on your Mac, your PC.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.560]   The email goes out.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.200]   They get a link very easy.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.720]   Even if it's a client that you're pitching,
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.080]   and they don't know what you're talking about,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.640]   they click the link.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.080]   The Java thing pops up and says, allow this?
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.440]   And they say, yes, and they've got it, and it's running.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.680]   Now they're seeing your desktop, but it's more than just
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.840]   your desktop now.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.000]   Go To Meeting has just added HD video conferencing.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.040]   And we've been doing these.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.240]   The quality-- everybody now has such great cameras
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.920]   in their laptops.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.800]   They've got internet.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   The quality is so good on these.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   It is actually rivals the $100,000 telepresence systems
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.640]   the corporate boardroom is installed a couple of years ago.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.400]   And you can use it right from your desktop.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.520]   It's so fantastic.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.280]   I want you to try it for free.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   I'm going to give you an offer code in a second for 30 days
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.480]   free.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.800]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.120]   And the offer code is Twit.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.960]   And you know what else is really cool.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.880]   Go to meeting now.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.680]   You can attend meetings, not just from your desktop,
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.040]   your computer, but from your iPad, your iPhone,
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.400]   your Android phone too.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.440]   Means more and more of these meetings
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.640]   will be held in the unusual locations, shall we say.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.320]   Yeah, I think you know what I'm talking about.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.280]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.520]   Yeah, I know it's a little echo-y,
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.800]   but I might have me here.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.760]   I'm watching to meet.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.400]   It's amazing.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.000]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.800]   Try it free.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.360]   Click the Try it free button and use the offer code Twit.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.040]   You'll be amazed.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.280]   Don't turn on the camera though.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.840]   Actually, I don't think you can use the camera if you're
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.280]   on an iPhone or an Android phone.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.400]   Just the desktop.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.960]   It's probably a good thing.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.880]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.320]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.880]   They're great folks at Citrix.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.200]   Yeah, I thought it was very interesting.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.080]   This is a very big meme going around now.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.160]   Of course, it was Google+ Mike that I first learned
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.800]   about it, the UC Davis protesters.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.240]   Now, first of all, I don't want to weigh in on the politics
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.600]   of this or the law enforcement of it,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.160]   because all we see is a camera phone video.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.800]   But it sure looks like they were sitting there quietly.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.400]   And one of the police officers came up
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.680]   and just kind of sprayed them a little bit with pepper spray.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.840]   And whether there was rationale for it, we don't know.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.560]   Maybe one of the kids was about to--
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.520]   I don't know what was going to happen.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.120]   But it just shows you there's cameras everywhere.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.680]   There's camera phones everywhere.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   And this stuff goes straight to the internet.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.560]   And to watch those pictures on Google+ kind of side by side
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.600]   with terrier square pictures of protesters throwing back tear
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.360]   gas, things like that, pretty dramatic.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   I thought it was very interesting.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.640]   What's interesting about all that
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.040]   is that all of these confrontations between protesters
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.680]   and police are about--
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.000]   the protesters are saying we can be in some location,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.160]   and the police saying we don't want
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.680]   you to be in that location because they've
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.240]   been given orders by somebody else.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.280]   They don't want them in the park.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.440]   They don't want them in the sidewalk.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.320]   They don't want them in the street.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.240]   They don't want them blocking businesses, whatever it is.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.720]   And so there's this--
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.800]   the argument over where you're allowed to stand as a mob
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.520]   is fueling this entire movement because it's
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.680]   those images that's drawing people to it,
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.040]   to feeling outraged and stuff.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.400]   It's completely unrelated to the issue of so many rich people,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.840]   so many poor people, and all that stuff, which
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.040]   is really what it's all about.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.280]   These were originally occupied Wall Street--
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   Exactly.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.080]   But it's the cameras taking pictures of police and protesters
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.960]   disagreeing over where protesters can be.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.920]   That's driving the whole thing.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.600]   It's crazy.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.520]   That's interesting.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.760]   I didn't even realize that's what it was all about.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.840]   There's a wonderful video from, I don't know,
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.440]   a month ago in New York City or three weeks ago, something
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:54.960]   like that.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.680]   It's not wonderful.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.480]   It's horrible.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.840]   But some protester said something
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.560]   to one of the white-shirted New York police officers, who's
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.680]   one of the senior guys.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.880]   And he just hauled off and clocked this guy.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.280]   And the cameras that came out of the woodwork.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.640]   And everything went pointed to this point
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.880]   where this was happening.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.920]   It was just amazing.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.400]   I mean, literally like 500 cameras came out of nowhere
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.800]   and just were filming the whole thing.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.000]   Yeah, incredible.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.920]   So what is the upshot of this?
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.920]   Is this-- how does this change our world if everything we do?
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.160]   And by the way, it's not always good.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.040]   I mean, teenagers nowadays, I mean,
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.160]   you can't-- there's no innocent act anymore, right?
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.080]   Everything is recorded.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.600]   And it's on Facebook whether you want it or not.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.240]   There's no privacy, right?
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.280]   How does this change our world?
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.120]   What does it get?
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.480]   It's changed.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.280]   How does it change it?
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.920]   It's changed.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.440]   It's done.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:46.600]   It's changed.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.800]   Everything's in public.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.600]   It's done.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.920]   Is it for the good?
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.560]   It's what it is.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.480]   It's what it is.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:51.960]   No, no, no, no.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.160]   Do we like cars?
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.480]   Are we agreed on cars?
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.600]   We don't agree.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.600]   No, you're right.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.120]   No, you're right.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.600]   No, you're right.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.920]   That's what technology in general--
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.800]   Why would it just become more ubiquitous?
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.360]   I mean, these screens everywhere.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.320]   What I think is going to happen next is there'll be screens
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.240]   everywhere.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.560]   And everything will be a screen.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.120]   Your table will be a screen.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.240]   The wall will be a screen.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.000]   And I think then you'll have sort of--
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.360]   It's like 1984.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.440]   There'll be screens that are watching.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.520]   Well, that's past 1984.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   I don't know if you know that.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.360]   It went by 20 years ago, actually.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.600]   But it didn't happen in 1984.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.880]   But I think--
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.240]   Yeah, no, it's just very much like--
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.720]   I think the ubiquitous technology everywhere--
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:34.080]   Does government run scared and start becoming more repressive?
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.480]   Or does it become more transparent?
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.480]   What is it?
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.640]   What happens?
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.200]   The initially instinct I think is the repressed down.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.720]   Shut down.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.120]   And then there's always that opening up
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   that happens afterwards, after that doesn't work.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.640]   Well, Egypt's a good example.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.120]   There was the initial revolt.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.800]   But then it didn't really create a democracy in Egypt.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.600]   But it strikes me that they're not going to rest.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.120]   Well, they'll--
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.640]   And they're going to continue to use internet.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.800]   It's not what it was, though.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.680]   Qaddafi's gone.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.800]   All these people are gone.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.000]   And it's not just about Egypt.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.200]   It's about the entire region and even beyond the Middle East.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.440]   In Syria, look what's happening.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.960]   In Syria, it's happening everywhere.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   And I think that in a lot of countries
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.880]   where you have conspicuously under democratic regimes
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.600]   like in Egypt, you're going to have regime change.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.720]   And I think ultimately in a place like the United States,
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.040]   and Europe, Japan, and places like that,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.160]   you're going to have a more subtle shift.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.800]   There's a lot of bugs under those rocks.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.680]   So we're going to have to keep turning over the rocks.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.920]   Keep turning over the rocks.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.720]   Keep shedding the light.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.280]   But I think in the long run, light breeds health.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.760]   Yes?
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.840]   You're so cynical.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.680]   I'm not cynical.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.320]   It's just you don't know.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.840]   I don't know how you know--
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.800]   is the car a better thing?
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.200]   I suppose it is, although we have a polluted planet.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.680]   Is the appliance a better thing?
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.000]   Yes.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.320]   Yeah, but is it transparency and exposure?
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.200]   And it doesn't-- it doesn't move you in that direction.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.640]   And manipulation.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.600]   If you assume that people can use that information well
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.000]   and intelligently and thoughtfully, then yes, sure, everything.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.500]   I do.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.040]   I think they can.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.840]   But I just think you don't know what people can do.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.400]   Well, I--
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.640]   And you don't know how the forces are aligned against.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.760]   And as you turn over rocks, sometimes it's a little buggy.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.600]   You have to smash them.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.400]   This is a big scorpion.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.640]   This thing's your hand and kills you.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.560]   The big difference between 1984 and what we have now
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.960]   is we have cameras in every home pointed at everyone.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.280]   The difference is that the government didn't put them in there
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.920]   to watch you in one direction.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.960]   We went out and bought them.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.320]   We sought them out.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.760]   And we opened the doors to our private lives
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.760]   because we love it.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760]   Right.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.600]   And so it's a democratically sort of grassroots incentive
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.320]   rather than 1984 thing where--
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.080]   and in North Korea, of course, it's 1984
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.800]   where they actually have radio broadcasts that you can't
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   change the channel and stuff like that.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.840]   You can't turn it off.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.760]   But it feels like for the first time we're flipping that back
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.800]   now, we're starting to watch the government, right?
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   Exactly.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   That's really what we have.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.720]   One hope, though, is that we get the equivalent of Britney
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.200]   Spears and protests.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.280]   The people who suddenly become celebrities
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.920]   because of protesters--
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.200]   and this actually has happened in the past where
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.080]   these people actually become very scary.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.920]   And the Trotsky's of the world become--
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.560]   for go from the overthrows to the repressors pretty quick.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.120]   Didn't end well for Trotsky, so.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.760]   Well, that's true.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.880]   You got the hammer and the thing.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.800]   But the noggin.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.560]   All right.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.360]   Well, I don't know.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.480]   This is maybe too obstrusan as a terra conversation
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.280]   for a simple little show like this.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.080]   But I just think it's kind of interesting.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.400]   And I noticed that it's happening right in front of our eyes.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.360]   Well, it's the instant information to say.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.840]   I mean, think about the Penn State thing,
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.440]   how much stuff you knew immediately,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.320]   and how quickly, although it's incredible,
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.480]   how much people kept hidden.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.480]   And it was out in the open.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.360]   And it was out in the open.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.480]   People knew about it, but nobody knew about it.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.640]   So do you think that that could have happened?
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.760]   That would happen now?
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.720]   It was happening now.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   I don't believe nobody dropped a dime on these people.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.000]   A secretary that heard about it.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.240]   Nobody-- it was actually being discussed the way
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.000]   that the government found out about it.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.920]   The prosecutors was in a discussion group online.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.080]   And then they started investigating that.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.040]   And so it was in plain sight what was occurring there.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.320]   A lot of people knew and just nobody dropped a dime.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:05.840]   And that's--
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.280]   Credit, probably.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.560]   --a cover of "Small Boy."
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.080]   I just--
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.000]   Probably go to that investigator who said, wait a minute.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.200]   And I'm going to pursue this.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.480]   I'm saying, but a lot of people knew,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.840]   and nobody did anything.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.320]   Right.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.480]   We have all these two cameras pointing
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.160]   both directions.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.000]   We have instant news, Twitter, all this.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.840]   But most of the world is still unknown.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.480]   And most of the things that are happening,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.720]   most big events--
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.760]   Or people who do anything.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.480]   --are not covered.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.400]   Nobody says anything.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.520]   Nobody does anything.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.440]   Reporting is nonexistent.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.680]   That's the big threat, is public apathy.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.280]   You don't even know if there's so much that it just
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:37.720]   overwhelms.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.880]   I mean, right now everybody's excited about the protests
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.640]   and stuff, but how is it going to be in three years?
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.680]   Everybody gets tired of it.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.640]   And the big protests everywhere, and nobody will pay attention.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.240]   So that's the big threat, is just people being so
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.120]   innervated by entertainment and fun stuff
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.640]   that they don't care.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   Or you get media-savvy revolutionaries
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.160]   who've become very good at manipulating all this stuff.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.160]   And then I don't trust them because God knows they
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.200]   might have all sorts of agendas that we don't know about.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.520]   But they're so good, we don't know.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.160]   All right, enough.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.040]   I don't want to talk about them getting depressed.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.960]   Depressed, Kerry, you've depressed me.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.120]   It's going to be either Planet of the Apes or Terminator.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.800]   One of them.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.400]   You did it, you damn dirty ass.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.080]   Well, you know what Google did?
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.960]   They did it this week.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.280]   They--
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.120]   Skynet, you mean Skynet?
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:20.480]   Go ahead.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.200]   Skynet, AKA Google.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.800]   They launched Google Music.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.120]   A little late, welcome.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.000]   Without much music.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.240]   I'm surprised Apple didn't buy a big full page out
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.760]   of the New York Times.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.480]   Welcome, Google.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.480]   Seriously.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   Seriously.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.080]   That's understood.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.520]   And yet, I think there's some important things.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.680]   Yes, they are missing a big label, Warner Music.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.520]   But they've got the rest.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.040]   They will.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.920]   They have 8 million songs.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.240]   But they say, hey, we've got to upload them, or whatever it is
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.160]   they do.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:48.640]   What do they do?
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.080]   When Apple started iTunes, they actually
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.560]   were digitizing CDs.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.080]   They were putting CDs in Macs.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.640]   Does anyone care, though, Google launched Google Music?
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.760]   I'll tell you why I care.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.160]   Android people.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.920]   I love Spotify.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.760]   And then you're right.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.960]   Spotify changed the game because you don't have to own
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.400]   the music.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.560]   You've got 13 million or whatever it is, 22 million songs.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.960]   On the other hand, here's where I like it.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.760]   And I wish maybe Spotify could take a page for this.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.960]   If you're an independent artist, you
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.320]   don't have to go through CD, baby.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.160]   You put your song up there, you create a page.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.960]   You get $0.70 on the dollar for the sales.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.120]   It's very good for independence.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.160]   That's the new publishing model for music, apps, books,
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.080]   the 70% model.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.960]   It is so great for content creators, as long as they can
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.480]   get the marketing and rise above the noise.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.720]   Because you publish anything right now, whether it's a
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.920]   music or a game in retail or a book, and the distribution
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.400]   channel takes, I don't know what, 90% of the value out for that.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.440]   There's another thing, which is that you can have more
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.000]   control over sharing.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.720]   I don't know what you guys, but I have a lot of musical
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.360]   things that I don't want anybody to know about.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:49.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.360]   What the hell can you be listening to?
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.760]   Embarrassing things.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.720]   Cherry Manalow.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.960]   Cherry Manalow, that's it.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.480]   Exactly.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:56.800]   I don't want that.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.280]   You're safe.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.320]   You're on the right side of the tape.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.360]   If I listen to the carpenters, I don't want that brought.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.560]   What can I say?
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.840]   Oh, I turned off my Spotify sharing two minutes after I
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.760]   turned it on.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.640]   It was like, I don't listen to Spotify, so other people
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.600]   can judge my music.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.120]   Exactly.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:10.640]   Thank you.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.480]   Don't judge me.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.480]   But here's your favorite.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480]   Well, here's your favorite.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   Okay, wait a minute.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.480]   What are you embarrassed that you're listening to?
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.240]   Is anyone really looking at your Spotify and be like, oh my
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.480]   God, look what he's listening to.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   No, that's not the point that the people are judging me.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   It's just like, I don't want to think.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   How do you feel about it?
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.480]   Exactly.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.480]   I don't want to be thinking, oh, so and so is going to see this.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   I'll hit yourself free.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.480]   No, be free.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   Free yourself.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.480]   This is a different thing.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   What's your guilty pleasure, Kevin Rose?
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.480]   I like stupid Christmas music, and I love it.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.480]   Sure.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.480]   You know what?
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.480]   This I'll be promiscuous, like Kevin Rose.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:40.480]   Exactly.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   I don't know what you mean.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.480]   Here's the other.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480]   The other.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   Share and share.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.880]   When you start sharing your music, even if you're thinking, oh, I
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.360]   don't care what anybody thinks, you're still thinking that as opposed to just listening
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.360]   to it.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.480]   So it bothers you behind the scenes.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   Exactly.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   At some low level, it's like, I mean, now I have to think about another thing instead of
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   getting a little more.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.520]   See, Mark, talk about from one of these things about launching Google music.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.320]   Let's talk about like download versus stream, because that's something that I've now moved
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.320]   on to all streaming.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.320]   I think that's what happened.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   It changed, right?
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.760]   And I feel like, you know, I used to buy the albums on iTunes because I felt like I was
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.760]   doing the right thing.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.440]   And now I'm just like, I haven't bought an album in forever because I have some Spotify
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.440]   and it works fine.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.560]   It has 90% of the stuff I want.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.360]   Like do we need another like pay to download this song service?
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.160]   It's something that the iTunes match.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.960]   I'm too exhausted to put up on my things.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   I'm the same way.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.760]   I just put everything out and just do Spotify.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.400]   It's like, no, I throw up all my mixtapes.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.400]   I did it.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   It's funny.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   I did both Google music.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   I uploaded 20,000 songs.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   I did iTunes match.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   I download everything.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   I just try it.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   But you're right.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   I just listened to Spotify.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.040]   I did all of it and now it's Spotify on my Sonos and I'm delighted.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   On the Sonos.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.040]   Yeah, there's the killer app.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.040]   I'm going to keep my mixtapes.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.320]   We're not going to have much of a show today because everything's just there.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.160]   But before we move on from music, what, here's the thing that makes me wonder.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.640]   My space exists.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   Still, believe it or not.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.320]   My space exists.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.400]   And there's a lot of music activity, music, people, and so on, going on with my...
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   Imagine what would happen if various people bought my space.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   Well, we didn't have...
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.400]   Well, we didn't have...
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   Somebody did buy my space.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   But if somebody...
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   The dudes in Los Angeles...
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   But when they were like...
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   Justin Timberlake...
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   He did not buy it.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.400]   That was a publicity stunt.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.080]   It was stunt cast...
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   ...venture casting.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.800]   So he didn't have any money in it at all?
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   He was an investor.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   He was supposed to...
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.200]   That he was an investor was the marketing campaign.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   Essentially.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.200]   They still haven't really signed yet.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   So they said, "We'll give you some shares."
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.200]   That's right.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   Justin, if we can use your name...
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.680]   Magic rubs off on the service and stuff like that.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   Whatever.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.760]   Somebody eventually is going to buy it.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   And what if Google bought it?
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   And it would be cheap.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   What if Apple bought it?
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.760]   What if Apple bought it and created a...
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.760]   It's dead.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   It's dead.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.600]   It was even a joke on Glee.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.000]   They had someone on Glee and they said, "Oh, Rachel, she's still on MySpace."
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   No.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Kiss a death.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   That's not true.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Nobody's on MySpace.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Does anybody say that?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Yeah, it was very funny.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   That sounds like a sous-soul-vestre line on MySpace.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   No, it was one of the kids.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   They were campaigning for class president.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   It was a fantastic...
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   All right, Google, music...
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.840]   I'm just trying to think of some reason why this could be important.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.760]   They now have that free share a song with anybody on Google+.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.040]   So I bought it and when I buy the album, they said, "You want to share it on Google+?"
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.640]   And then everybody in your group can listen to that entire album for free ones.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.440]   Hi, would anybody want to buy an album on Google+?
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.880]   Unless you're an Android user already.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   Oh, you're right.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.600]   There's no conversation about music on Google+.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.840]   It's all about photography.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.840]   It is.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.840]   Well, it's been through you circle.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   It's true, but it's really not the place where...
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.480]   You're just suffering the scolbel effect.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   That's a problem.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   No, you know what?
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.200]   I did the same thing as Mike did, which is I followed all those photographers and now
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   it's all pictures.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   That's right.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   I'm not great pictures.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   They're wonderful.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   I know.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   I'm a couple.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.160]   But it does, but you know, I think that you shape Google+ to whatever you circle, obviously.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.840]   So if somebody circled a bunch of independent artists...
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.840]   It's a circle.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.840]   Good God.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840]   I have to feed my children every morning.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   I have to have a circle anyway.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.840]   Honestly, it's like, look here, you know, you have to pump your own gas and now you have
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.440]   to sort your friends out on the list.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.200]   It's too much work, he's saying.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   Mark said that.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   He said, nobody wants to make lists.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   Nobody wants to make lists.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.200]   So what do you do?
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   I don't.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   You just...
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   I don't.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.200]   How about that?
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   Are you on Facebook?
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.200]   The Facebook?
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   I like to call it the Facebook.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   I think so.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   I am on the Facebook guy, but I ignore it most of the time.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.680]   And I just use Twitter and people want to find me.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.040]   You're prolific on Twitter, though.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.040]   I am.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   I love Twitter.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   Twitter's useful for something.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.040]   I feel like Twitter's old hat, but maybe that's just because I...
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.040]   I love it.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.040]   It's very simple.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.640]   It's a very simple exchange of information.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   I would say you're the bellwether.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.640]   Well, I...
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.640]   I don't want to...
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.640]   I was a M.A. shareholder of Twitter stocks, so...
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   I'm not the one with Twitter.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   I don't want to send it to them.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.640]   Hey, I like this Apple pullover.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.640]   That's cool.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   Steve, give you that?
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.200]   The problem with Twitter versus Google+ is that you just, you know, in 10 seconds you
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.360]   can hook it up so that everything you post on Google+ goes out on Twitter.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.200]   So it's like, you know, for me, Twitter, I'm just done using Twitter.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.000]   It just happens automatically.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.320]   You know, Twitter feels almost like the ghetto now.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.320]   I mean, it's just...
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.320]   I can't understand it.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   It's gibberish.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.840]   There are so many hashtags and abbreviation.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   I'm getting old.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.080]   It's just like I don't get it.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   The kids are talking there.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   I'm like getting.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   I did a...
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   I'm old too.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.080]   Don't worry.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   I'm very old.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   I'm old.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.840]   I used Twitter for the first time this week in a couple months.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.800]   If you have to use Google+ for a while and read declarative sentences and prose and you
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.240]   go to Twitter, it's like, "What are you kids talking about?"
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.240]   I was like social networking.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   Exactly.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   Do you like any of them anymore?
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   I don't either.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.200]   You know, the other day I was writing about something and I said, "When's the last time
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.680]   you read something that you didn't have to share that you said nothing about?
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.720]   Like you saw a movie or read something in a book and you just didn't share it?"
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.720]   Wow.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   Wouldn't that be weird?
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   I know.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   You didn't have a life?
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.720]   Like not shared.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   You wrote a post about it with social networking.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.040]   This is the next big move, by the way.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.360]   My 19-year-old daughter, this a year ago, everybody's going to say, "Oh, I'm done with
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   the internet."
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.560]   He had ice cream with his son and didn't tell anyone until he wrote a column about it.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.560]   Yes, yes.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.560]   That is true.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.560]   How dare you?
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.560]   Not tell anybody?
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   Not tell anyone.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.200]   I was going to to oink my caramel cone.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.760]   Where's the pictures?
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.000]   But I couldn't get a connectivity at the buy-right.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Photos or it didn't happen.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Buy-Rites.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And they did your favor.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Yes.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   I had a little socks.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   That's a great restaurant.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I read to Mark.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   You know what I did?
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   But you know what?
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Let me tell you.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   So I didn't tell anybody.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I ended up not telling anybody.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   They have like an aberrant.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   It was great.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Are you kidding me?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Is that B-I-R-I-T-L?
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   B-I-R-I-T-L.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   It's right on.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   It's on Dolores and a R-S-T-G-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   You're not a hit-certain-tape.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.400]   Although your chart said that you're prone to cardiovascular or whatever.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.360]   I can't go to a baby or better not discover by that.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.200]   I admit that I did today delete four-square from my iPhone.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   Really?
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   It's the only way I will not use it is if it's just gone.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   Because I can...
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   Well try Facebook.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   You can't use that anyway.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.800]   I find myself compulsively checking in and I just realized, "Wait a minute.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.440]   I don't even know where I am anymore.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.040]   I'm just like this all the time."
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.040]   Interesting.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.440]   So you're going to become the angry old man shaking his fist at the Internet?
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.640]   I don't want to be used to working on it.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.640]   Who has been to that?
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   No, no, I don't want to be that.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.640]   I want to be...
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.560]   I guess this is early adoptersies is what it really is.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.640]   Is that we're burned out because we've been doing this for too long.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.640]   But I love that oink.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.240]   You should have a whole hermit thing going on.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.240]   I don't know.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   I don't want to be that guy.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.640]   We already got the VORAC for one thing.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.880]   But I don't need to be that guy.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.120]   And I don't want to be that guy.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.760]   Well use it for what you like.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.760]   Use it for what you like.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.760]   That's what the best part about.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.760]   Plurk is up for sale, right?
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.760]   Kingston.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   What is?
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   I don't know.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   Plurk, Pounce, one of those things.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760]   Plurk.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   Pounce is gone.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.760]   Oh, you were involved in Pounce.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.760]   Yeah, he's one of the...
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   I choose Magic.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   Nothing.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   Google Music, nothing.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   It's funny.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.560]   They're too late to the party because it's Spotify.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   200 plus...
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.640]   But Spotify, there was Spotify late to the party.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.880]   Because Spotify came after Mogg and Rhapsody.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   Love Mogg.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   Love Artio.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   Artio was awesome.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.880]   I was on Artio until I went to Spotify.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.880]   We're all good.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.880]   See?
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   We sell like...
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   And then you'll be on something else.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   Another promiscuous one down there.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   What about this?
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   The 200 totally.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   200 as long as there's no determination clause on Spotify.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.120]   Or disease they could follow.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   That ETF.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.360]   200 plus labels withdrew their music from Spotify this week.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.240]   You know who I think could give some of the labels there on.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.240]   There aren't 200 labels.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   There's three.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.240]   But...
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   These are little guys.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.880]   These are little guys, right?
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880]   But...
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.520]   And I think Amazon...
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.760]   We probably want to talk at some point about whether Amazon's going to have a phone.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.760]   Yes.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.760]   That's coming.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   Don't get ahead.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.760]   We got a whole list of...
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   I'm ahead of my time.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.760]   You're getting a few minutes.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.280]   So a study claims that streaming music is damaging to record sales.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.640]   So a distributor named ST Holdings.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:52.320]   That represents 200 labels focusing on techno, grime, dubstep, and bass music.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.760]   You're going to have to explain that to me.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.760]   Dubstep's the news though.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   I love dubstep.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   I'm actually surprised.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   Did you record that?
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   We can...
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.760]   Wait for the drop.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   Whoa!
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:11.280]   So apparently you're not going to hear a lot of dubstep on Spotify.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.600]   Which is fine.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.400]   238 labels contacted.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.200]   I guess they're small from ST Holdings.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.760]   Four said they'll keep the rest said.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.720]   234 labels, but gone.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.000]   They had to have a study to know that streaming music is damaging sales.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Really?
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   I mean...
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.480]   Well, but that is the problem with Spotify.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   We know this.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.760]   You don't make any money when people listen to your music on Spotify.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.320]   Because you don't have to pay for it.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.320]   You just have to pay for it.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   Right.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.320]   You just stream it.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.320]   Right.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   It seems pretty straightforward.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   So if you're a musician, are you screwed?
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.640]   Well, you get a few cents every song, right?
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   You have to tour.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   That's right.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   That's the great full dead.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.640]   Figured this out 30 years ago.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   But that only works for the Shakira's of the world.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   Yeah, many people can tour.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.640]   They come with the Ice Cream one as well.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.640]   Well, you got to work.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.640]   You got to work.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.640]   Ice Cream is amazing.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.640]   Ice Cream?
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   Ice Cream Sandwich?
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.640]   Ben and Jerry's.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   Ben and Jerry's.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.640]   Are we back on Ice Cream?
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   He's a very special one.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   He's talking about his own music.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   You make money doing that as well.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   It's a fish one too.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.640]   Selling your name to Ben and Jerry's.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   Yes.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.640]   Ben and Jerry's is the new power on the internet for artists.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   Have you had a sweaty ball since it was?
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.640]   Have you been to Zach?
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.640]   Alex, Alex Baldwin.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   What is it?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   I've heard about it because I watched Twitter.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.640]   I bought a because of the name.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.640]   I didn't know what I meant referred to.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.640]   It's the chef and...
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.640]   Oh, I'm so glad I'm cool.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   Yeah, so you know.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.640]   But I don't understand.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   What does it taste like?
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   The sweaty balls.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   I'm not even going there.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   But is it salty?
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   Oh, I'm just...
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.640]   What if you were going to make it ice cream?
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.640]   Which apparently they did.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.640]   I'm so glad I let my children go to happiness.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   I'm glad I let my children go to happy feet too instead of coming here to watch this.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   I want to be at happy feet too.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.560]   So by right people.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   They don't have lavender.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.560]   They do.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   They do.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560]   They do.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.560]   They do.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.560]   They do.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.560]   They do.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.560]   They do.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.560]   They do.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   They do.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   They do.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   They do lavender caramel.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.560]   It's a limited batch flavor and owed to a classic...
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.560]   Oh, that's the Saturday night.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.560]   I was thinking of the chef from South Park's salty.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   No, that's the...
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   Yes, there is.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.560]   This is a different...
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   Okay.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.560]   So...
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   Oh, there's a video.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   It's called with little...
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   Oh, here it is.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.560]   Hint of rum.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.560]   It's good.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.560]   Loaded with fun.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   But I'm never buying it again because of what it's called.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.000]   And chocolate covered malt balls.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.560]   Now we've just taken all the mystery out of it.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   Exactly.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   We've killed it for everybody.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   Sorry.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.560]   So what does this have to do with anything?
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.560]   I'm going back to 200 labels dropping this by the fuck.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   Yeah, let's go back to the internet stuff.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.560]   All right.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   All right.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.560]   Actually, let's take a break.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:37.200]   I wish I had Ben and Jerry as a sponsor because we could all be enjoying sweaty balls, right?
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.000]   Hit.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Ben or Jerry, either one of you call me.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.040]   Let's talk about Ford.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.560]   They're so glad for this moment in time that they are here on the show.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.800]   Actually, Ford is doing some amazing stuff.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.360]   Thanks to their new CEO.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.400]   It's been there three years, four years now.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.200]   Alan Malali came from Boeing.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.680]   Engineer, I like that.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.520]   He was the guy who said, "You know what?
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.720]   There's going to be a little tough time in the economy.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.640]   Let's make sure we shore up our finances so we don't have to take money from the government.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.240]   They didn't take money from the government."
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.560]   He also was the guy who designed the 777 cockpit at Boeing.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.960]   I think if you look at modern Ford vehicles, you might see a little correlation there.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   Yeah, that's very good.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   I interviewed him.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   He's a little guy.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.320]   He had one of the best D interviews.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.800]   He didn't get as much attention as the CEO.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.600]   His CEOs are not normally good interviews.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   He's fantastic.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   They're too guarded.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   They don't really ever say anything.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.960]   His fan, he almost got made by a Ford.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.200]   I just wasn't buying a car at the time.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.520]   I have to say, I'm going, my next car is going to be a Ford.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.160]   I drive a Mustang.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.880]   He's been, you know, he's been named as a possible Microsoft CEO after bomber.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.880]   That's interesting.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   Please don't leave Ford.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.880]   I'm just saying.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.880]   And he always wears this sort of red cat.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.880]   He's a court against car.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.880]   Yeah, a card against you.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.880]   He's great.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.160]   He gave me a kiss the last time I saw it.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.600]   He's a really fascinating guy.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.280]   He's a really interesting, anything intriguing fellow.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   Not the best kiss I ever had.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.320]   Anyway, the Ford.com/technology, they've made a page.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   One of the things he decided to do is really become more of a consumer electronics company.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.400]   And I think that this vision is happening thanks to Ford's sync and my Ford Touch.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.000]   By the way, they, you know, it's interesting.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.240]   I can't remember, used to be by a car and it's unchanged until you sell it, right?
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.640]   My Ford Touch, they're going to send out next year 250,000 USB keys so people can plug
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.960]   it into their car and update the my Ford Touch software.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.120]   Because people are saying it's too hard to use.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.400]   They said, okay, it's software.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   That's what's going on.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.160]   They treat their cars like gadgets.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.200]   It's a consumer electronics company.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   That's why they can't do it.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   CES the last three years.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.600]   They've got to make the stuff easy in a car that I mean, it seems to be.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.280]   I actually like my Ford Touch because I'm a geek.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.560]   You know, I like things like the cruise control.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.760]   You set the miles per hour, you know, exactly.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.760]   I want to go 56 miles and it does that.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.480]   I didn't have any trouble with my Ford Touch.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.080]   I understand some people did.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.200]   It's going to be updated because it's software.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.560]   The Ford Sync, you talk to your car.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.680]   This is Siri three years ago.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.240]   And in fact, now they've got the Wi-Fi access spots.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.200]   You know, but we always talk about Ford Sync and I always forget that primarily this is
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.720]   a GPS system.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.120]   It is simply put the best GPS system I've ever used.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.960]   If you haven't used the Ford Sync GPS system, it will get you there.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.560]   Little things that are nice, better than an aftermarket GPS because it integrates with
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:17.240]   the car for instance, when you get to, you know, the 50 mile left warning, all the gas
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.880]   stations pop up on your GPS.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.640]   So you just know where the nearest gas station is.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.480]   It'll tell you where the lowest prices are.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.920]   The incredible EcoBoost engines, the electric engines, the plug-in hybrids.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.200]   I'm on the list for a 2012 electric Ford Focus when those come out.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.600]   I'm very excited about that.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.800]   In fact, that's where you'll see this, this my Ford Touch and Sync and its best advantage
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.680]   is that 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.960]   My key for teenagers, you don't need this yet, Cara, but you're going to.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.360]   It tells the car what the maximum speed can be, the maximum volume on the audio.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.880]   You, my children aren't going to be driving until they're 50.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.880]   Yeah, that's, I know.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   You see that now, wait.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   Wait.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:53.880]   It's coming.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.160]   Actually, my son, for some reason, he's 17, he still hasn't taken the driver's test.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.720]   I'm going, "Please don't take the test."
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.440]   My daughter took it like the minute she could.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:06.320]   Anyway, it also, with a fuel light, comes on 75 miles to empty instead of 50 because
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.880]   they know teenagers never fill the tank.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.920]   I just love Ford.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.960]   Drive one today at a Ford dealer near you.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.240]   Do take a look at the Sync and my Ford Touch.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.560]   I think you'll love it.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:22.760]   And we thank Ford so much for their support and the tip of the hat to Allen and his whole
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   team.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.080]   He's put together a great team.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.080]   Even their marketing is very--
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.400]   It's in new forward things.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.840]   We got two on Region 3.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.000]   They're fast.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.400]   How come they give you a Mustang?
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   I bought my Mustang.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.400]   Do they give you one?
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   Yeah, totally.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   It gives one.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   Come on.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.400]   You got that kind of pull there.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.400]   You can get it.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.200]   No, I thought, I actually went to a Ford dealer in town.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200]   They don't give it just the speed.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.120]   And I paid-- oh, you have to give it back.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.120]   Yeah, we have to give it back.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   We get it for like three months.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.840]   I think they know that I'm kind of a leadfoot.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.680]   And if I got the new one, I would just--
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.680]   But I have the GT.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.080]   I have a nice-- it's nice.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.080]   But I do.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.400]   I know the new engines are just amazing.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   OK, let's-- gosh, where can we-- oh, the Kindle Fire.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   Sucks.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   What?
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   I love it.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   It's horrible.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   What?
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   It's heavy.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.400]   It feels like you're going to drop it.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.400]   It's laggy.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   It's dense.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   It's-- it feels solid.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.400]   I didn't find it laggy at all.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.400]   Mr. Mossberg, I wasted you.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.400]   I know Walter.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.880]   But he got a prerelease, I'm sure.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.880]   I bought it.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   No, he got up on mine too.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   I sold it the same day.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.880]   Really?
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.880]   Yeah, it's just like--
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.880]   You didn't wait for the mic.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.880]   Chad, would you get me my Kindle Fire?
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.640]   It's really-- if you've held one, right?
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.640]   No, I haven't had one.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.000]   Or it feels like you're going to the gym.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.160]   But I believe the reviews.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.160]   Yeah, it's just really heavy.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.160]   No, I love it.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.160]   You drop it, you're kind of screwed.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.640]   It's seven inches, which is a great size.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.640]   It feels solid.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   I put it in the case.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.640]   They had the Facebook app on the front.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   It was like one of the default icons.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.440]   And I'm like, all right, Facebook's built in.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.960]   I hit it and it launches m.facebook.com.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   Like, I was like, what?
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   Yeah, that was kind of lame.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   It was a bookmark.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.960]   That was kind of lame.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   He does not like it.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.280]   The device is not created for the Kevin Rose's of the world,
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.280]   however.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.120]   It's cheap.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:52.880]   I like it.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.880]   200 bucks.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.880]   Really cheap.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.040]   If you can't afford an iPad, is it $200 Amazon digital store front?
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.920]   She's saved your money and save it for an iPad.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.680]   Wow.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.160]   I call the Kindle Fire the iPad for my mother.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.760]   They're going to sell $6 million in this store.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.960]   I'm on my mom, actually.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.760]   My mom likes the Kindle and she wants to play call for us.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   I love the Kindle.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.720]   But she wants to do touchscreen steps.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.240]   Well, they have the new Kindle Touch now, too.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.440]   No, that don't get that.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.640]   That, I will say, don't get.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.640]   I don't.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.640]   I haven't used that one yet.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.640]   No, don't get the Kindle Touch.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   Do you have it?
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   Yeah, we played with it and it's not responsive.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   It's dumb.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   Just get the physical buttons on the $80 Kindle.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.640]   Yeah, that's my vibe.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   It's fun.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.640]   It's little you can put it in your pocket.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.640]   Now Barnes and Noble responds with Jane Lynch.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   Look, it's fantastic.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   I'm seeing you.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   I heard this one is great.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   This one's great.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   See, I think it's the same thing.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.920]   It's twice the processor speed, better battery life.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.560]   Can you hear my audio or is it not?
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   Look at that.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   I got to hear Jane.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   I got to hear Jane.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.560]   You don't hear any audio?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   Oh, is she doing that for?
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.560]   Yeah, come on.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.560]   Nothing, huh?
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   Oh, man.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.560]   I can pull it up.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.560]   She's a friend of mine.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.560]   She's a wife.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.560]   Really?
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.560]   Really good friend of mine.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   She was a D.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.560]   She opened D this year.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.560]   She did a funny thing at D.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.560]   She pretended she was the acting CEO of Newscore.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.560]   That was fantastic.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   Did you get any, of course, D is owned by Newscore?
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.560]   Did you get any pushback from that at all?
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.560]   I think Jane is a little bit of a star there, so I don't think they push her around.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.560]   They love her.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.560]   Oh, Fox, Glee.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   What am I thinking?
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.560]   I think they leave Jane Lynch alone for now.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   Okay, here we go.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   Let me see.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   And also Rupert's busy with other things I think.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.560]   I'm Jane Lynch.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.560]   And this hot thing's the brand new note tablet.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   Who are you?
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560]   My boys and all.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.560]   Oh, geez.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.560]   It's their fastest lightest tablet with all my favorite books.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.560]   So it's lighter.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.560]   Jane, can I?
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   I'm excited.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.560]   You got the best streaming movies.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   See?
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.560]   I scored.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.560]   Yeah!
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.560]   Introducing the tablet.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.560]   Books.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:45.560]   The best in HD entertainment, Facebook.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.560]   As far as I can tell, this is a Kindle Fire from Barnes & Noble.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.560]   That one, people think, is fantastic.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.560]   I don't get the difference.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   I think it's more responsive and quicker.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.560]   This is your fire?
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.560]   This is a bright fire.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.560]   Brian?
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.560]   Brian?
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   It's heavy.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.560]   Let me see.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.560]   Let me see.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.560]   Oh, it's not heavy.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.560]   And look it.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.560]   Okay, responsive.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.560]   Let's see.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.560]   I don't know.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.560]   It feels pretty responsive to me.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.560]   I'm not even a book here.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.560]   Sherlock Holmes.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.560]   Oh, he has a tablet.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   There's your camera.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.560]   Oh, you got it.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.560]   Can I check my camera?
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.560]   Well, let me just show the folks at home.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.560]   Brian, you're a motorcycleist.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   Interesting.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   This is a failing, but I don't think this will be a failing for long.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   Most of these magazines...
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.560]   You see how those menus appear in this period?
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.560]   They look like they're PDFs.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.560]   I agree.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.560]   This is lame.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.560]   They look like it's slow.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.560]   See?
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   It feels like a little chunky.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.560]   Oh, come on.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   200 bucks, man.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.560]   No, I'm not saying it seems like a good value.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.560]   Which is the kiss of death among your crowd.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   You could play Plants vs. Zombies.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   I don't know.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   Okay.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   Here you play with it.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   I think I like it.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   Our expectations were reset by Apple, which nailed it out of the park with the initial release
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.560]   of the iPad.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   But, I mean, this is here to stay.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.560]   I agree.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.560]   And it's just going to keep getting cheaper and better.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   They now have upped their shipments to us.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   They think they're going to sell $6 million in the quarter.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:05.560]   They're $6 million.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.560]   And it's subsidized.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   And really what this is is a cash register for Amazon.com.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   It's just a window to spending all your money with the...
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:21.560]   I think it's a completely legitimate, inexpensive tablet for at least half the people would buy an iPad instead.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   I think they make slicker.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.560]   It's version one of the couple of things.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.560]   Remember the first Kindle?
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.560]   That was the worst industrial design ever.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.560]   There's the only thing I really don't like about it is the on/off switches right in the bottom there where it's easy to knock.
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.560]   And I think it's a little bit more about it.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   It's a disaster for Google, in my opinion.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:41.560]   Because what they're doing is Amazon is using Android to decimate the rest of the Android tablet money.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.560]   It's easily the best Android tablet.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   You would grant by far the cheapest because it's subsidized.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.560]   I mean, there's a scorched earth on price.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.560]   I always test everything up.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.560]   Angry Birds has served my way I test everything.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.560]   If any of the birds pleases me.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.560]   I like 7 inches.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   I think that's a nice size.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.560]   You can type on your thumbs.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.560]   But you're right, the forking.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.560]   As soon as it's in the experiment.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.560]   Who knows?
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.560]   Well, most Android tablets.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.560]   I mean, I have apparently the best one in the Galaxy Tab.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.560]   I cannot stand it.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.560]   I can't stand those either.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   But even worse is the pricing.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.560]   Nobody else will be able to sell an Android tablet if you can buy that.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.560]   That's right.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.560]   Subsidized.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.560]   It's much cheaper.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.560]   It's really good.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.560]   It has all these other benefits.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:27.560]   And again, they're using Google's own Android to poison the Android ecosystem.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.560]   They're using your Android tablet.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.560]   And as soon as Facebook comes out with its device.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.560]   Yeah, sure.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.560]   The phone, it will be a phone or a tablet.
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.560]   Everyone's going to be four.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.560]   Everyone's going to do a device.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.560]   And what about an Android?
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   You keep hearing these Amazon phone rumors.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.560]   Is there any credit?
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   I think it's going to happen.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   All things do you have the story.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.560]   We did.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.560]   Peter's got the thing.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.560]   You think it's going to happen too.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.560]   He was quoting a city court -- who was quoting Digitime.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   It's always Digitimes.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.560]   All these rumors.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.560]   You know, it makes sense.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.560]   It makes sense.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.520]   Why not? Why not do it?
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.520]   Why do it?
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   People can have choice.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.520]   You're not going to just be at least Android phones.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520]   Here's a book.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.520]   I'm going to turn the page of the book.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.520]   Can you show this thing?
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.520]   Does this feel slow to you?
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.520]   There's a little hesitation, but that's not going to kill you.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.520]   It's fine.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.520]   There should be hesitation in flipping a page of a book.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.520]   Really?
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.520]   Have you ever flipped a page on a book?
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.520]   A little hesitation.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.520]   It's faster than a book.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.520]   It's really clean and smooth.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.520]   I understand the iPad is beautiful.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.520]   That's all I'm getting at.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.520]   I'm not saying this.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.520]   That's my size.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.520]   That's what, by the way, what people have said for years about iPhone versus Android phones
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.520]   hasn't stopped people from buying Android phones like crazy.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   Because they're cheap, mostly.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.520]   You go fix it.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.520]   Is it about price?
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.520]   It is about price.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.520]   And here's what I think Amazon is going to do with their upcoming phone.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.520]   They're going to target the youth market.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.520]   They're going to have a subsidized phone.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.520]   Free.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.520]   Might as well do it free, right?
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.520]   Free or close to free.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.680]   You don't want it to be completely free because then you get all the people who will never
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.520]   spend anything gobbling up resources.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   You get people to sign up for a music service, for example, and they get a free phone.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:09.240]   That is really compelling to a lot of teenagers and young people who don't have parents who
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:15.880]   buy them their own little iPhone, which is the majority of young people.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:21.200]   This could be a huge benefit for all of Amazon's digital offerings and movies and music and
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.600]   stuff like that.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.200]   Here's the new sidekick going to be.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.040]   Like right now sidekick.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.040]   Remember sidekick for a while?
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.040]   I remember sidekick.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.320]   But it was the smartphone for teens.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.400]   It was the hot phone for young people.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.840]   And then Microsoft did the kin, the same market.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.840]   And they strangled it.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:37.840]   Right.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.880]   But the sidekick of the future could very well be the Amazon Kindle phone.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.320]   You know, 50 bucks.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.600]   And you know, I think Facebook is going to have something to say about that first.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.600]   They have to.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.960]   And if the Facebook phone comes out, teenagers are going to go to that like crazy, right?
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   That would be.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.760]   That replaces BBM in the high schools.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   I mean, Facebook.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.840]   Why do you need a Facebook phone?
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.680]   Because Google is going to shove them off of either Google, unless they do some sort
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   of app.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   Why does Facebook need a small thing?
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.920]   They won't be a default install.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.400]   Yeah, they might be, but they can start shoving them down.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.760]   You know, I would think they'd want something where they have an operational social operating
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.920]   system kind of thing.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   Why not?
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:17.440]   I mean, what it is is the expense of creating these things, it could be quite high and the
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.520]   expertise levels that are needed.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:24.160]   But it seems like mobile is where most of Microsoft customers are using Facebook.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:28.200]   Can you either decide your HBO and all the cable companies have to have you?
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   Right.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.320]   Or you worry that perhaps someday they might not have to have you.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   Right.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.560]   So the theory really is that all technology, interaction, all screen interactions, is going
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   to go to the phone.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.440]   So if you want to be a technology company that interacts with consumers like Amazon or Facebook,
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.440]   you better have a phone.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.440]   Is that the...
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.320]   You don't have to now, you don't have to now, you can just own the operating system and
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.320]   then you have all these manufacturers.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.320]   That's what Google did.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.560]   It has been a version of a Facebook phone, but not a very serious one.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.560]   I just think why not?
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.560]   Why not have that?
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.000]   Nothing's going to go to the phone exclusively, but everything will have to be on phones and
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.760]   people will use phones for all digital content.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.080]   So are you thinking that Facebook is actually going to manufacture a phone or are they going
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.840]   to create an operating system that's forked off of Android and provided to carriers?
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.840]   That's what I mean.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   I think that's something they've talked about.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.640]   Are there actually manufacturing a phone?
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.640]   No, no, no, not manufacturing.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   Oh, branding it.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   Facebook branded.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   Okay.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   Are there already Facebook...
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.440]   There are something that's much more Facebook.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:23.120]   With more integrated address book, call from your Facebook menus, Skype built in, now Facebook
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.720]   and Skype are like married.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.920]   So you even need to have a wireless...
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.040]   Do you even need to have cell phone connection anymore?
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.040]   No broadband.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.040]   That's changing.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.040]   What if...
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:38.400]   I mean, it didn't Apple, apparently, there's a story in here that Steve Jobs wanted to have
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.520]   his own wireless network built on the Wi-Fi spectrum.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.480]   And I think that that's something that's in the works with other companies.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.480]   You're doing an end around...
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.480]   Don't even do cellular.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   Don't even do cellular.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.040]   Well, you need cellular for when you're not in Wi-Fi coverage.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.040]   But actually, you know, I've got...
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:59.120]   No, no, no, because we've got these companies that are doing kind of satellite Wi-Fi, right?
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.720]   A lot of people imagine that Google was looking into stuff like this.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   I mean, this makes...
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.720]   I always thought Google was in the spectrum auctions to get to stuff.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:06.720]   What do you think of the Facebook?
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.720]   I mean, why wouldn't they think about...
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.720]   So we're seeing...
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.000]   They are terrified of Google.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   They are too.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.320]   And they don't have a good relationship with Apple.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   They've tried at various times.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.320]   I think they were...
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.520]   Someone just the other day who would know was telling me that they were surprised by
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.240]   the Twitter deal that Apple did.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.440]   But they've had a very difficult...
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:28.520]   Not the same kind of bad relationship they have with Google, but it's definitely a very
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.200]   troubled relationship with Apple.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.720]   And that's their natural ally, I would think.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.920]   Well, Microsoft isn't natural ally now.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:36.920]   No, it's their ally.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   They're only ally.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   But one of their allies is...
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:39.920]   They're unnatural ally.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   Well, you know, Microsoft has Skype.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.440]   I just think Skype is one of these things they bought that didn't really...
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.560]   I think it's a very valuable thing in the phone area.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   It could be.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   Skype replaces cell phone.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   What if they...
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.560]   I mean, this is just me.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.120]   I sit around and a lot of people say, "How do you come up with your scoops?"
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:56.560]   I just sit around and think of what could happen and then start to check it as if it's
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.560]   true.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.960]   Sort of like three days of the Condor, I'll imagine things.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:06.280]   And one of them to me is, "What if Microsoft sold Bing to Facebook or gave Bing to Facebook?
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.240]   What if Microsoft gave Skype to Facebook or did something where they got more stock?"
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.560]   I mean, you could start to think of some really interesting scenarios in that case.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.560]   And so you need a phone.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:19.080]   Like, what if there was a Skype integration with a Facebook and they already are...
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:23.280]   It just seems to fit Mark Zuckerberg's worldview and plan.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.280]   Exactly.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   Absolutely, right?
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:29.720]   So I'm thinking like, why does some business development do in wearing khaki smarter than
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.480]   I am or Kevin or anybody else?
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.800]   You can sit there and start to think of what they must be thinking of.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:41.200]   And to me, some sort of link with Skype and a phone and it just makes sense.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   Do you know that Microsoft try and push their own OS though with the...
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.200]   Not necessarily.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.480]   No, no, I don't think so.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.480]   I think they're very hands-on.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   It just seems like...
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   So here's the scenario.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.400]   You need a Bing thing into Facebook would be super...
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.400]   They've just...
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.400]   I can see that coming.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.080]   They've thought of that for sure.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   Here's the scenario.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.360]   Microsoft's Windows Phone Nokia deal tumbles in a year.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.360]   It didn't work.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   They're going to get less than 10% market share.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.880]   Microsoft's Microsoft starts to back off on the consumer market, sees itself as an enterprise
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.640]   play, says, "Maybe we're a B2B company.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   Maybe we're an IBM.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.640]   Maybe we're a service company."
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.080]   I suppose they might spin it off.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.080]   Yeah, they might spin it off.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.440]   They just use a metty just one over there to be hit a marketing, which is interesting.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440]   So I'm an expert.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.960]   Then, if they're an enterprise company, then it's not such a big deal to say, "Okay, let's
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.960]   sell Bing and Skype."
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.960]   I got to...
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:33.280]   I got to think it's a very smart move for them to be thinking of that strong because they
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.200]   could be paying for the costs of Bing, the technology.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   Bing's a huge money.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   They're online presence.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   750 million dollars.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   Huge money, loser.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   Yes, it is.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.400]   But if they move it into a...
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.520]   You just have to move it over to where it does make money.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.640]   The important thing is that Google fails.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.640]   Not that Microsoft succeeds in the series.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.640]   That's really what it's all about.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.640]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.640]   It's just a story.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.440]   Who is that the important thing for?
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.440]   Microsoft?
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.440]   Microsoft?
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   Okay, just checking.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.080]   As long as somebody uses Bing to make Google less attractive in some way.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.080]   Bing, if you look at all the problems, you can see that.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:08.320]   All the partners, Bing actually has a fairly respectable percentage of sales.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.320]   It's like over 20%.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   No, no, no.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.320]   Together with Yahoo.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.320]   If you include all the flavors of Bing.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.440]   And who knows what's going to happen there?
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.400]   That's an interesting situation because it really... whatever happens to Yahoo deals with
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.520]   market share and it could drop Bing quite far down again.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.680]   We know it will be a very interesting few years.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.760]   Yes, it will be for sure.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.840]   That much we know.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.600]   We also know that the most likely iPad buyer is a male pet-owning gamer who may be a scientist.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   Oh dear.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.320]   I decided I had to go buy a pet now.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.920]   Because in every other respect, you fit.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.920]   Exactly.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.920]   That's what it means.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:43.080]   That's actually my girlfriend's a scientist and I have a pet.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.680]   So this is why you hate the Kindle Fire.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.920]   People who like organic food.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.040]   I know Freed's article and all things do.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.040]   I love it.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.920]   Ena, is that how you pronounce it?
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   Ena.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   You can say "I" and I think.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.440]   I know Ena, you say "tomato."
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.560]   We call it a machine gun freed.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.560]   Machine gun freed says "Blue Kai has made this infographic."
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.960]   I love infographics.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.360]   They tell you nothing but they tell you nothing in such a pleasant way.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:14.040]   It's kind of like Ben and Jerry's, "Schwetti Balls."
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:20.520]   CommScore found that 45.9% of all tablet owners belong to households earning $100,000 a year
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   or more.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.520]   Shocker.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.000]   It's an aff, boy, as you can be.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Afflin.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.720]   Nielsen says 70% of all iPad use, 70% of all iPad use occurs in front of a TV.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   Is it on?
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.160]   Get ready for the Apple TV.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.160]   70%.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.560]   Yeah, I use it.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560]   70%.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.360]   That's where you use it.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.200]   Apple knew that.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.600]   Remember that Steve Jobs.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.800]   People must have TVs in their back.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.000]   Rolled out the iPad sitting on a couch.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.200]   Oh, I guess that's the other 30%.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.040]   Yeah, that's where people use it.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:58.920]   That's why it's so shocking to me that Google+ does not have a real app for the iPad or for
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.360]   the tablet that anybody would want to use.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   The Facebook doesn't either.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   The Facebook app is awful.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.360]   Is it really?
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   I like this.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.360]   I don't like it at all.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.360]   The new Facebook app.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.360]   Yeah, the new for the iPad, I kind of like it.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360]   It took them forever to get out there and it's just kind of bluff.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   Does it crash a lot?
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360]   Yeah, it does for me.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.360]   It's horrible.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.600]   But to me, the social networking sitting in front of the TV on an iPad is the Nirvana
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.040]   that nobody seems to recognize.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.000]   That's what America wants to do.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Is sitting in front of the TV and he needs an iPad.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   You know who else wants that?
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.920]   The television networks, they find that ratings go through the roof when people are tweeting
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.120]   about their shows.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.440]   Look, it glies a good example.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.560]   These services of social TV, they watch into a promo without a hashtag on every ad.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.560]   Really interesting.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.400]   We had Steve Levitan who running Modern Family, who's the creator of Modern Family, one of
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.320]   them at Deke last year and he was talking about that most of the internet stuff was
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.760]   useless to him except that they watched Twitter during the show to see what jokes work because
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.160]   of people talking about the jokes.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160]   They retweet the joke.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.160]   Then they insult each other.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.640]   The writers go, "See, we told you that.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.040]   I think Steve's missing a bet."
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.200]   Oh, no, he's a very big geek.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.000]   He's actually a huge geek.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   He's fantastic.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.920]   He's the main character Phil Dumphey.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.920]   He's that's him.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.920]   He's him.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.440]   But he was trying to think of ways that it was particularly helpful to ratings.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.440]   Well, I think it drives audience.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.360]   I think, well, maybe not for Modern Family, but for the Oscars, for the Super Bowl.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.360]   He just didn't know what are translated.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.520]   I think the problem with Hollywood is it's not clear if he has all these views on Hulu,
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.160]   if he gets paid for it, they don't get credit for internet stuff.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.240]   They get credit for Nielsen ratings.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.480]   He was talking about when is it going to switch where we do get credit for internet
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.280]   watches, which is a very fair point.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.960]   Is it telling in any way that Bob Iger is now, the CEO of Disney's now on the Apple
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960]   board?
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960]   No.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.960]   Makes sense.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960]   Makes sense because Disney Apple, it's like a Nexus.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.960]   I guess Steve's wife will be the biggest shareholder of the entire--
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.960]   You know, something occurred to me.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960]   Something occurred to me.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960]   When I went to the family shares there.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.280]   No, the family gets the name of the business.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.880]   Do Steve Jobs' kids tell their friends, you know, Mickey Mouse?
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.880]   Yeah, we own that.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.880]   We own him.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.880]   Do you know?
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880]   He owns a lot of it.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.880]   Well, it's only six or seven percent, but it's still the largest shareholder.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.880]   He's the largest shareholder.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.680]   If I was a sixth grader, I would.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680]   It's a big piece of the money.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:07.240]   And the new chairman of the Apple board is the chairman of Genentech, which is interesting.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.000]   It's a good board, though.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.720]   I think it's Steve Jobs' built board.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.320]   And it makes sense that Bob Iger would be honest.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   Yes.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   I'm not going to say anything.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320]   It's not telling.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.800]   It's not Hollywood comes to Silicon Valley.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.760]   He's also very internet savvy compared to a lot of Hollywood people.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   Right.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.360]   Let's do a commercial and come back with more.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.360]   We got a great panel.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.600]   It's so much fun to have these smart people here, so I can learn.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.120]   It's supposed to be dumb people.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.120]   Oh, we have dumb panels.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.120]   Trust me.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120]   But I'm learning, you know, that the fire--
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.120]   When we leave, you'll be saying the best.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   I thought this was good.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.680]   I thought Facebook and the-- I thought it was good.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.680]   Now you know.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.680]   Now I know.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   I have to reform.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   You said they swiped unlock on that?
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.680]   Yeah, what about it?
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   They did.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.680]   They did.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.680]   They're like, let's be different.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.320]   Let's make it swipe the other way to unlock.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   And you're like, really?
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   We already know how to swipe the other way.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320]   I don't know.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.600]   I like the little-- I like the thing like pictures in the background.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   That's nice.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   I like the password on it.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   You foiled me.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.600]   I've been foiled.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   Well, let's look with the ink with the fingerprint
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   skull on the keyboard, because you can usually tell what that is.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.600]   That's right.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   We can actually just always figure it out.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   We'll hack this thing.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.600]   Why do you mission impossible over there?
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   I can tell with it.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.600]   The only thing I like at the button on the bottom, because it's so easy to hit that button.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.600]   All the kindles have that though, right?
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   Well, they should have a little slide.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   The headphone jack's on the bottom too, right?
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   Yeah, that's weird.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.600]   I don't like that either.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   It should be up here.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600]   Then it goes straight to you.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.600]   You like that?
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.600]   It goes straight to you.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600]   That's a good point.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.600]   It's a team to your house tonight.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.600]   Let's take you down.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.600]   I'm a fire fan.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600]   The headphone jack is amazing.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600]   That's all right.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.600]   You can have a background.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600]   But anyway, I'm learning.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   Thanks to Cara Swisher from All Things D. We're so glad to have you, Mike Elgin.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   I want to say of Google+, but that's kind of where you live.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.600]   He lives on the plus.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   Elgin.com.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   That just takes you to his Google+ page, so there you go.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   Also, Ralph Noodleman from CNET.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   The podcast you do is called "Reporters Roundtable" at 8-10 AM.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.600]   It's this show with smart people.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   There's only one of them, so I can focus.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   Oh, it's just you and another guy.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.600]   One or two others.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.600]   How can you call it a round?
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.600]   The table is in-pack round.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   It's a two-top.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600]   It's a two-top.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.600]   Yeah, and the service sucks.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.600]   Kevin Rose.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   I did not say "Rafe Noodleman."
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   It's "Rafe Noodleman."
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.600]   It's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.600]   Of the needleman.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.600]   Kevin Rose of milk and oink.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   I want to talk a little bit about oink and how it's doing and what it is.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.600]   Is this the beginning of more from milk, right?
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600]   All mobile though.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   Oink, bah, nay.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   You could do the whole farm.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   There's another company still.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   It stole your oink, by the way, already.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600]   You didn't see that?
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600]   I'm going to show you.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   I'll show you later.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.600]   I don't want to depress you.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.600]   It's exactly the same thing.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.600]   It even looks the same.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.600]   It's featured on the Apple.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   You didn't see this yet.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.600]   It's the biggest iPhone I've ever seen.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   You know, I put it in the oink because it's got a giant battery on it because it's got no battery life.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   6.7.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600]   No, no, that's not it.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   That's a camera thing.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.600]   Let's see.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.600]   Do the funny thing.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600]   Tiny review.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   Look.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   Yeah, it's not tiny review.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   Look at this.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.600]   Doesn't that look a little bit like oink?
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   You got a little bastard.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.600]   You can't really rate this stuff.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.600]   None of them have Kevin.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.600]   Now you have to hire a lawyer.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.600]   That's a complete ripoff.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600]   That's all good.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   See, he's a nice guy.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.600]   I would be living.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.600]   Nice guy.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600]   He just told his face.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.600]   He's turning red right now.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   Yeah, right.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.600]   That's right.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.600]   Does that mean making a Kindle version of your app?
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.600]   I guess not.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600]   Are you going to do Android?
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.600]   Actually.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   There's a lot of people out there.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   There's a lot of people.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600]   I'm going back.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600]   You know, I have this iPhone for us.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600]   I love the camera.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.600]   I like Siri.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.600]   Like not love, but I like Siri.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600]   But I miss Android.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.600]   There's one problem for developing with Android.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   I'll probably get some haters for this.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.600]   But you've got two ends of the spectrum on Android.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:51.600]   You've got the really hardcore geeks that love the tweak every little thing.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600]   They love Android.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   And I want to develop for those people.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.600]   They get the understand technology.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   Then you have just a bunch of the masses that just got the, oh, that's a free phone.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   It looks like a smartphone.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   I'm going to go ahead and get that.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   They'll never download an application.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   They have all this huge install base.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.600]   And that's great.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   But these aren't really the people that are going to be using my app.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.600]   So I want to develop for the geeks and the people that would install it and actually
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.600]   get some use out of it.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   But at the same time, I don't know that the market is as big as they claim it is, as
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   far as actual downloads.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600]   Right.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:27.600]   In fact, recent surveys I've seen said developers really don't want to do so much Android stuff.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.440]   They're kind of have to maybe.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440]   But they really like to develop.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.600]   The iPhone, people buy stuff on the iPhone.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.600]   That's the key.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.600]   So there's David Prager's.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   Oh, I got to turn the sound on.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   Here's David Prager's invitation.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   Oh, no.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   That's Prager.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600]   That's David Prager.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600]   Yes, David Prager.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.600]   Yes, David Prager.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   He'll do it for you too.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600]   Next thing we have him on the show, he'll just do it straight up.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.600]   Because he does it on command, which is awesome.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.600]   It's like deliverance.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.600]   Originally, I had a sounds on for every event.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.600]   Yeah, you got to turn that on.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.600]   I'm going to check them all.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600]   Just so we'll know.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.600]   O-I-N-K, it's on the app store.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.600]   Now it's free.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.600]   It's free.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.600]   And it's really, it's quite beautiful.
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.600]   Daniel Berkham must have done this.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.600]   He's such a good designer.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:09.600]   He's such a good designer.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.600]   I just love it.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.600]   Really, really pretty.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.600]   And lots of twin stuff.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   Look at it.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.600]   See that?
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   And we just wanted to make it so that users could go.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.280]   I mean, there's so many apps out there that are about, you know, there's been Yelp, there's
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.600]   been Google Places, there's been a bunch of apps out there to say that a place is awesome.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.600]   But it doesn't tell you what's inside that place is excellent.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.600]   Right.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.520]   As I understand it, there doesn't have to be a place.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520]   It doesn't.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.520]   It can be just a thing.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.520]   One of the favorite movie that you enjoy, whatever you want.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.000]   It could be Tree-Torn rubber boots.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.160]   Somebody was talking about Legos.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160]   Legos sets.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.160]   Cycle shirts.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.640]   That was the one on the first, oinks.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.700]   Daniel loves eggs, Brussels sprouts, and roasted duck for breakfast.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.980]   He's a little, a feet, but that's okay.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.380]   Dave loves pumpkin pie.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.460]   Who doesn't love pumpkin pie?
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.680]   Who doesn't love milk punch?
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.680]   And then people come and all.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.680]   These are all at different places.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.280]   If you look at the underneath that one there, it's as--
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.880]   Foreign cinema for Bloody Mary, bar Agricole.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   How do you pronounce that?
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.880]   Agricole.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.760]   See when I studied Latin, it was Agricole.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.760]   Agricole.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.280]   It's farm.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.600]   Agricola, Agricoli, Agricole.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.600]   Scones.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   Scones.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.240]   Who doesn't love scones?
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.960]   Although in Sconland, they call them scones.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.960]   Scones.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.960]   Anyway.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   Oink.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   I'm going to go to Sconland.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960]   Are you going to go to Sconland?
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:23.960]   I didn't even know what the scones come.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960]   Is that a country or a theme park?
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960]   Sure.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.960]   Let's talk about Audible.com.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.200]   And we'll get-- see, I have the best panel here.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.680]   I would just could say you're drinking wine.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.680]   Thank you for the wine, by the way.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.680]   You will.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.680]   This is--
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680]   You're all getting drunk and I'm not.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.680]   And I'm going to start asking questions.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.680]   There's a wine called Donkey and Goat.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.160]   I'm a small investor full of--
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.200]   It's a natural wine called Donkey and Goat.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.200]   That's correct.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   Does it come from Donkeys and Goat?
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   There's a little bit of Donkey and Goat.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   There are actually Donkeys and Goat's.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   I mean, let me wink it.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   I mean, wink it.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   This is actually a question.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.680]   There are actually Donkeys and Goat's in the history of this winery where there was
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:02.080]   a-- they use-- sometimes use vineyards that are not tended, irrigated, no pesticides,
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.080]   nothing.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.440]   And the weeding was done by a donkey.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.840]   And Donkeys get lonely because they're very social creatures like us.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.680]   And so they had to go to keep the donkey company.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.720]   And that's where the origin of the name, as I understand it.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.480]   But anyway, this is a fantastic wine that is--
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.480]   Pretty joke.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.840]   Is he still talking?
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.760]   Because I have a-- I wasn't paying attention.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   Are you onking?
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:23.760]   How do I like it now?
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   I've lost track of my onking cable.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   I press the link, right?
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   Press the pigs snout.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   Press the pigs snout.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   We're on my Twitter.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.760]   Twit, brick house.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   Snout.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.760]   How do I add?
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:33.760]   Do it here.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.760]   Do it here.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:35.760]   Do it here.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.760]   And I'm going to go over here.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.760]   OK.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.760]   Now I say what it is.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.760]   Yeah, so this type in the name.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.760]   So donkey and goat.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.000]   See, now the moment is passed.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Yes, see, that's to me.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.440]   It's like, I'm just a suraward drinking.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.760]   I want to go home now.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760]   OK, go.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.760]   OK.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.760]   And add a tag for wine.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.760]   Yes, you can see how I got it all in the wine.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.000]   By the way, what you can do is you can become an expert on wine.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.360]   If you do enough wines, you raise your wine reputation.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.960]   See, there's the wine tag.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960]   So I'll select that.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.960]   And add an upper name.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.160]   And maybe I should add Pinos because this is a Pino.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   And I bet you there's a Pino and War tag.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160]   And I'll add a picture.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.880]   I'm wondering, as it's a thought, a complete.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.680]   Oh, put it dot there.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.640]   And O-I-R.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.640]   OK.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.040]   And then I'm going to add that.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040]   OK.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040]   Now I'm adding the tags.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040]   Now I have to take a picture, though.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.520]   Yeah, so once I add the tags and add them, there you go.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.880]   There's a photo.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   What the hell?
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   Who's that?
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880]   You've got to flip around into your face.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   Oh, that's me.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   Oh, that's a weird dog.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880]   I haven't seen that.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.880]   It's something strange has happened.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.360]   Something very odd has happened.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.920]   We pull back.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.920]   Pull back.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.400]   You were just into glass.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.800]   Oh, I was getting reflection, probably.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.320]   Right.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:38.960]   OK.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.840]   Donkey and goat Pino.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.400]   This is like the Mark's Brothers of F.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.080]   And then you could do a filter on it.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.360]   So they got like kind of--
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.960]   I like the light and dark.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.960]   Oh, you do the Instagram.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.480]   Booze.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.000]   No, we didn't.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:50.800]   So that's the biggest.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.040]   We didn't want to do like vintage filters.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.160]   We just want to make like food and--
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.960]   So you can see it better, basically.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.040]   So that's all it is.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   So I'm going to--
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.600]   You can drink the tag bottle wine in the time you're posting on it.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.080]   Save that.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:01.600]   All right.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.120]   All right.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.680]   No, but that's the same thing with all of these.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.160]   Because it takes you spend the first five minutes when you--
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:06.660]   Right.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.160]   --enter in place.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   --doin stuff.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.160]   Now what?
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.320]   I say I love this one because actually I do.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.720]   Now that we're going to tell all your followers.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.320]   And then now it says Leo loves this lovely Pino.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.840]   Now you're going to have that because you follow me.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.040]   You're going to have that on yours.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.600]   And you can add a little donkey goat.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.000]   So now I see the donkey goat.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.500]   Right.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.160]   I saw that you liked it.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.320]   I go in here and I just say--
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:25.920]   It could thumbs up.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.640]   It thumbs down.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.280]   And if you hated it, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:28.760]   Bam.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.480]   Interesting.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:30.480]   Riveting.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.720]   I like goats, though.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.240]   I like donkeys.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:32.920]   I was thinking--
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.520]   So the doggies get lonely and they have a goat pal?
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.240]   Exactly.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.240]   They do that with horses, too.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:37.960]   Goat's very friendly.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:38.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:39.480]   Horses like goats.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.160]   We were doing our 10th D this year of all,
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:42.600]   if you can believe.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.100]   Really?
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:43.600]   Congratulations.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.240]   Exactly.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.320]   And we were-- I was with someone who thinks we should
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.760]   do pranks throughout the whole time.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.260]   No.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:48.760]   No.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.600]   That person is wrong.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.880]   One of the things was to put a goat on the edge of the stage
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.800]   and just not reference it.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.240]   And I just have it sit there.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.560]   And what's wrong with that?
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.720]   I'm getting the mittling.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.840]   Just have it sit there.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.360]   Just stand there.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:58.880]   It's strange.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.240]   Now the person wanted us to put clowns in everyone's
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.520]   closets and they jump out.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.680]   Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.920]   It's really nice, awesome.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.920]   Yes, the first D-heart attack.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.800]   You'll have quite a few ice-chemic attacks.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.720]   Yes, we will, indeed, including myself.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.880]   I don't like clowns for this song.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.760]   No one likes clowns, but I saw some good clowns
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.920]   at Cirque du Soleil because they were--
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.720]   You would not like a clown jumping out of your closet
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.400]   with the Taren A.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.200]   Oh, it's terrifying.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:18.080]   Palace for a day's sake.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:18.640]   Terrifying.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.600]   Hey, did you see Twilight breaking wind--
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.120]   Breaking Dawn?
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.920]   Yes, I did, of course, last night.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.600]   So you know that you probably read all this Stephanie Meyer
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.360]   books by now.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.400]   No, I did not read them.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.720]   She's a Pauling writer.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.320]   She's terrible.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.760]   You probably could listen to them.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   You could hardly--
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.160]   Well, suppose I suppose now.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.520]   Look, here it is, Breaking Wind, the Twilight Saga book 4.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.760]   And it's on audible.com.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.160]   And I could get you that book for free.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:40.880]   No, thank you.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.400]   Book 5 and 1 and 3.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.440]   And now again.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.880]   I just endured the movie, which I adored.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.080]   It would spoil it for you.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:46.440]   No.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.600]   Let's listen to a little--
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.440]   No, it's awful.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.520]   --of the Twilight Saga.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.040]   Oh, no.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:50.400]   That's fantastic.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.560]   Narrated by Ilya Kadushin.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.480]   They couldn't get shatner.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.400]   And then he kissed me.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.680]   So there's a wedding in this one, right?
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.640]   He doesn't kiss him into, like, book 15.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.080]   Right.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:00.440]   Because--
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.480]   Remember, I'm having audio.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.200]   You can't hear it.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.880]   But believe me, you don't want to.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.160]   So audible has everything.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.560]   But your teenagers are going to love this.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.080]   And it's going to get them into reading,
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.440]   because they listen to these audible books.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.360]   In fact, they've done studies that kids who
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.240]   listen to audio books read more.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.600]   Because they get excited about books.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.480]   And it's a great way to get somebody into books.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.320]   The Harry Potter book.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.080]   The guy reads them.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:23.600]   Jim Dale.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.240]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.080]   Everything's--
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:26.600]   Harry.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.080]   Harry.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:27.440]   Harry.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.160]   Very amped up emotionally.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.880]   Harry Potter took his wand and couldn't believe it.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.120]   It was made of wood.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.120]   And it's like everything is very exciting.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.040]   But it's good.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.360]   The new Stephen King novel?
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.600]   Nope, that's not a real quote from the book.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.600]   It's amazing.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.920]   His wand was suddenly hard.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.480]   No, it's a children's book.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.240]   That's my goal.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:49.840]   It's a children's book.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.720]   Not anymore.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.480]   But have you read the sexy Harry Potter?
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:53.520]   No.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.400]   And you know the--
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.920]   --jakin a rolling sand fiction.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.880]   I'm sure there's lots of fan fiction.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.760]   People, you know, Hagrid.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.280]   Hagrid.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:00.760]   Oh, no.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.240]   Let's--
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:01.760]   New Stephen--
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.760]   He's going places that I want to go.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.480]   He's going back to breaking dawn where they're not.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.120]   New Stephen King novel.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.760]   Anyway, the point is that audiobooks really are--
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.720]   thank you, Don.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.800]   It's good to see you.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.960]   Audiobooks are really fantastic way to read,
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.040]   because nobody has time anymore.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.440]   You have the Steve Jobs book out now, too.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.040]   I listened to it.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:19.640]   That's how I listened to it.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   Who were the--
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.600]   I can't remember his name, but it was very well written.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.000]   And it's about 30 hours.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:26.680]   It's a long book.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.600]   And of course, I would never have gotten 25 hours
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.320]   in 10 minutes, still in Baker Reads.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.400]   I would not have gotten through it had I not had the audio
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   version, but I listened to the car.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.320]   I listened to the gym.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:35.800]   I listened to it.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.520]   And I listened to Mom watching the dishes.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.520]   And it took me less than a week to read what is normally
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.640]   a very long read, because of that.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.800]   So really, that's the idea is you get more reading done.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.400]   They've got 100,000 titles.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.320]   And if you go to audible.com/twit2, you can pick two of them.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.800]   You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.720]   That's a two book a month subscription.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.320]   And the first month's free, the first two books are free.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.280]   You can't sign any time.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.440]   And they're yours to keep forever.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.520]   As you can see, current events, classic science fiction,
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.960]   child's size, and would be such a wonderful book.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.080]   I won't tell you that there's got a little bit of a twist
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.120]   at the end there.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.080]   Won't tell you about that.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.640]   But in fact, all the Arthur C. Clark stuff is now on here,
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.600]   because Audible has a program to record.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.320]   They call it Audible Frontiers, classic science fiction
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.240]   that's never been available in audio.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.400]   And it's a great way, if you're catching up,
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.600]   or your kid is catching up, the Solaris that they did.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.560]   They actually commissioned a better translation,
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.240]   because Lem always thought that the translation of Solaris
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.800]   was a botch.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.800]   And so he supervised a new translation.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.720]   And this is fantastic.
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.240]   If you haven't read--
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.520]   maybe you saw the movie.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:47.360]   There was a terrible movie that was very dull.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.000]   But this is a great book.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.560]   Solaris, the definitive edition.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.240]   It's a brand new translation.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.840]   Anyway, audible.com/twit2.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.360]   I hope I've shown you some great things.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.680]   I just read The Wind Up Girl.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.560]   That's really interesting.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.720]   It's really good.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.640]   Paolo Bachagalupi.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.200]   Very interesting book.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.360]   My next book is 1Q84, which is about 500 hours.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.880]   But that's the thing is you can get aggressive about your reading,
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.480]   and you get much more time to read.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.680]   Or Breaking Dawn, The Twilight Saga Book 4.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.480]   Yeah, no.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.360]   No?
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:18.700]   Come on.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.480]   How could you like the movie and not want to read the book?
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.320]   It's so bad, it's good.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.360]   Is it like badly written?
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.720]   Bad acting, bad everything.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.640]   It's fantastic.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.800]   It's one of those.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.680]   And then you have the Screaming Teenage Girls in the back.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.880]   The whole thing is fantastic.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.400]   No, OK.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:29.880]   So, OK.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.240]   Now this is good, because there's a nuance
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.800]   that was missing from the social media aspect.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.440]   You shared it.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.040]   Where else would I want to be on a Saturday night?
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.080]   But I didn't get that you were doing it in ironic.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.000]   It was ironic.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.080]   I completely enjoyed it.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.600]   I can't deny I enjoyed it completely.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.680]   So it's a guilty pleasure?
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.600]   Taylor Lawtoner is such a bad actor.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.760]   It's enjoyable.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.800]   He's like-- he literally is the worst actor.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.840]   But then he pulls off his shirt.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.720]   Any time something goes wrong, you know what I mean?
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.720]   And then that's fine.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.720]   That's what I do.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.920]   He's very nice.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.320]   He's a very handsome man.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.640]   But anyway, it's interesting.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.840]   What was interesting is a lot of the tech in the movie
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.360]   was fun.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.320]   There's tech in Twilight?
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.760]   Well, at one point, they pull up a lot of Apple computers,
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.800]   which I doubt Apple paid for anything,
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.960]   because they never pay for placement.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.960]   They don't do placement.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.160]   But then he's going to look up the whole baby thing,
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.720]   what the hell's going on with Bella?
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.600]   She's dying.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.200]   And he goes to search.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.160]   And it's Yahoo's search.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.160]   And you're like, what?
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.280]   And the whole audience goes, what?
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.880]   It's the most unbelievable moment.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.240]   It's a little jarring, isn't it?
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.280]   And they have Android-- all have Android phones.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.240]   They all have Samsungs.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:25.760]   Some sort.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.520]   I think they had Galaxy--
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.280]   That's a placement.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.120]   That was a placement.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.760]   And you're like, wait, none of this works again.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.960]   And then of course, I was with the button.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.160]   I took some people from all things D,
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.120]   and they were all like, all those don't work together.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.320]   They don't work together.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.160]   Like, why would you use an Apple and have an Android phone?
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.200]   So then there was a long debate.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.640]   But it was interesting to watch their tech.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.480]   So they're telling me that 1Q84, you should say,
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.000]   1984 is like Charday.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.160]   It's spelled 1Q84, but it's pronounced
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.560]   Charday.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.440]   I don't get that.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.680]   Because Q is 9 in Japan and Japanese.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.480]   So you pronounce it 1984, but it's 1Q84.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.280]   The vampires and werewolves were more believable
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.120]   than Yahoo's search.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.520]   Maybe vampires use Yahoo's search.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.880]   Except that the werewolves talked in really bad CGI.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.160]   So it was like one of those Taiwanese news commercials.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:07.840]   Oh, no.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.040]   The whole thing was just fantastic.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:09.800]   Oh, man.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.000]   That sounds like an hour I want to see it.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.600]   And then they broke the bed, which is even better.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.680]   They broke the bed?
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.640]   Like, into splinters.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.840]   They didn't kiss for three books,
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.960]   and then they break the bed.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.960]   Well, I guess there's a lot of pent up demand, so to speak.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.960]   Google traffic, Google+ traffic.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.600]   I don't even want to talk about Google+ on board.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.440]   Netflix.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.360]   Hello.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.760]   This is a good story.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.000]   Given your interest in media, they're
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.120]   going to bring Arrested Development back.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.080]   Great.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.680]   No, I cannot watch it again.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.520]   You know, they are also what made a deal for House of Cards,
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.960]   which is a very good British show that Kevin Spacey will
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:45.760]   be starring in.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760]   Netflix is--
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.280]   It was a movie.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.960]   It was a mini-series, House of Cards.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.560]   You're thinking of the David Mannet movie, House of Cards.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.120]   This is not that.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:53.760]   Fantastic movie.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.680]   This is a wonderful movie, not the one that Netflix bought.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:59.000]   They bought a British mini-series called House of Cards
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.640]   about the whip.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.960]   There are whips in it, but it was the whip of the House of--
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960]   In parallel.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.760]   Here's the thing.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.760]   This is what's making me mad.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.840]   I was thinking of doing a calmness.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.080]   I have all these different things,
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.480]   and I have to go to each of them to get all my media.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.680]   Like, I have to get pieces of things.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.200]   It drives me for changing channels on television.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.720]   I know it's worse.
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:18.720]   No, but it's still--
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.000]   Because each has its own HDMI port.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.720]   Why should I have to use all these different--
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.840]   I don't know why Apple can't have Amazon on it,
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.720]   so I can buy my Amazon Prime.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.280]   I have Amazon Prime, so I use a lot of their videos.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.200]   We watch old Star Trek and old Twilight Zones,
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.640]   because they're free, and we like--
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.240]   Actually, I read all my Kindle books on my iPad,
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.520]   because there's a lot of Apple app.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:37.200]   But Apple won't make an Amazon video app, which is really--
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.400]   Exactly, which is what you want.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.640]   You guys know it's coming, right?
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640]   Google TV.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.240]   Google TV, they're updating the 3.1.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.440]   They're going to add the Android market.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.480]   That may be the Google TV app.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.280]   Right, they will add it.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.880]   But I'm just saying it's just interesting.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.360]   Muronic Abellmont, who I'm pleased to say,
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.840]   is one of our newest hosts.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.800]   She's going to host a gaming show on the channel next month,
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:56.480]   called Game On.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.240]   Actually, it'll be in January.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.880]   Crowdsourced a spreadsheet.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.280]   If you go to bit.ly/settop, in which they have all the set
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:08.880]   up boxes, and which stuff they support,
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.320]   and you'll note there's nothing--
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.400]   It's in Christmas colors.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.360]   Yeah, that supports-- well, it's for Christmas.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.600]   There's nothing that supports everything,
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.800]   except a computer.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.920]   If you have a Mac Mini, and you put a home theater PC on it,
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.000]   it's a lot of work if you're really crazy geek.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.240]   But you can get everything on that.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.480]   But it's not like changing the channels,
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.200]   because all the channels are on the TV.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.480]   No, it's very frustrating.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.160]   Because they're all on H different HDMI ports.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.040]   You've seen the quality of it.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.880]   I have seven HDMI ports.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.920]   I have a Roku, a Google Plus, an Apple TV.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.000]   I filled up all the seven HDMI ports,
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.640]   because you need each of the set-top boxes
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.320]   to get all of these things.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.320]   It is annoying.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   It is annoying, but whose fault is that?
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320]   It's the fault that they don't care about consumers.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.320]   I mean, it's great that you can get all these things,
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.160]   and I know that it's going to be eventually fixed,
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.920]   but the way they go about it is so anti-human.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920]   Well, who's going to fix it, Kevin?
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.920]   You said it would be fixed.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.720]   Apple, Apple.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.920]   They'll have an app store for the TV,
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.120]   and you'll be all good.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.000]   Download the Hulu app, download the Amazon app,
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:01.520]   whatever it is.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.720]   It'll be like the same thing.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.520]   So when that's what Steve was talking about in the book,
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.320]   when they say he says I've licked it?
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.120]   Well, it'll probably be powered by Siri,
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:08.920]   so he will listen to it like--
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.320]   So it's voice control.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.520]   It needs to be, because then it's easy to use, right?
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.120]   He was obsessed with the last--
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.320]   even the last weeks of his life.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.520]   He was talking to people about it.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.520]   A lot worked, by the way, a great column about that.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.520]   Two-hour walk.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.920]   Yeah, he left out a lot of stuff too, which is interesting.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:23.920]   Well, what, like what?
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.520]   I'm not telling you.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.120]   Oh, come on.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:28.120]   They had a very interesting professional friendship.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.320]   I think it was really interesting,
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.920]   but I thought he put a lot of it.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.320]   You know, I just think he was still--
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.520]   Steve Jobs was still excited about the things he was doing
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.720]   right to the very end, because they were talking about
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.320]   plans, things he was working on.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.520]   And the TV was one of them?
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   Yeah, I think it was among-- he talked to a lot of people
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   about it, even in the last weeks.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.120]   I just think he really didn't-- first of all,
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.720]   was still excited about different things
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.520]   he was going to tackle.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.520]   And I think that was the one he was really focused on,
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.120]   because he was kind of obsessive focused on it.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120]   Do you think he watched TV?
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.720]   I mean, maybe that's one of the issues.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.720]   He was a music guy.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.320]   He was a music guy.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.020]   And I wonder if one of the issues is that none of the geeks
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:01.120]   who are designing these things are actually the people
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.120]   who watch TV.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:05.020]   Well, I mean, in terms of Steve Jobs,
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:13.460]   his obsession since the late '90s had been finding lousy content
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:16.020]   experiences and fixing them.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.020]   Did it with the iPod, then the iPhone, then the--
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.180]   That's a key transition.
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:19.860]   It's not computing.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:20.580]   It's content.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.340]   Exactly.
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:24.320]   And so there's no question that TV is part of that,
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.940]   because it's a horrible experience.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:27.940]   We just were talking about how horrible it is.
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:30.220]   I mean, the cable companies-- everything about cable
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:33.020]   companies is awful, especially the interfaces,
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.020]   especially the remote--
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.460]   I mean, because the previous thing was cell phone companies,
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.740]   which also awful.
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:40.820]   Well, we got the Apple TV, and I had the Comcast.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.820]   The Roku controller is very simple.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.620]   But I literally-- my mother was trying to explain Apple TV
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.120]   to her.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.060]   And I go, look at the Apple thing.
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.540]   Look at the Comcast thing.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.820]   And she's like, gosh, those are different.
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.700]   I mean, she had the Apple one in two seconds.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:54.860]   She was able to use the Roku one,
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.060]   but it was still confusing to her.
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:56.940]   It was interesting.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:57.780]   Well, they saw for guys.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:01.260]   They know how to put on the screen what apparently--
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.660]   Comcast puts on them in the remote control.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:04.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:06.820]   I think it's interesting, though, that Netflix is on--
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:08.420]   so that's the delivery side.
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.340]   But on the content side, Netflix is essentially
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.340]   trying to create an $8 a month HBO.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.500]   But I love this concept that the internet is a farm program
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.900]   for a TV series.
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:18.660]   And it's like if it--
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:19.660]   Well, this is the opposite.
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:21.180]   This is a canceled TV series.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.340]   But it still has an audience.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:24.420]   But in both directions, one in development
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:27.220]   becomes really popular online, then it goes to the prime time.
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:29.820]   And then when it fades and it still has some hardcore fans,
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.980]   it goes back to the internet.
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.300]   I think that's an interim thing.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.580]   I think, in fact, we had Dana Brunetti on who's the guy who
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:37.460]   sold House of Cards to Netflix.
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:40.100]   His company, Trigger Street, is Kevin Spacey's production company.
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.580]   And Dana said, look, this is the future.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.220]   This is the way it's going to be.
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:46.100]   There's a temporary period where you have these players.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.620]   But ultimately, content creators are
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:50.380]   going to sell it as close to direct to the customer as possible.
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:52.660]   I think an app is the best way to go, right?
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.700]   Instead of an arrested development on Netflix,
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:55.980]   an arrested development app--
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:56.900]   That'll make sense.
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:57.020]   Right?
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:57.820]   You pay a couple of bucks.
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:59.100]   Now that's my app.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.700]   And think of all the additional features
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:01.620]   you can build into a minute.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.540]   Let's say a Glee app.
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.660]   Well, the Glee has a great app, actually, a karaoke app.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.660]   It'll probably be a subscription base, right?
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.140]   You'll go and you'll get ABC, and you'll
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.060]   pay the $5 a month or whatever.
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:10.740]   It's all a cart for--
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.100]   Forget ABC.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:12.740]   That's the point.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.500]   Forget ABC.
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.500]   You say they'll just build a great their own.
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:17.260]   But then you have the same problem
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:20.820]   that you have with the music industry and with publishing,
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:23.780]   which is that the word has to get out.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.340]   Now, social media can do so much.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:28.020]   The challenge with television is that it's expensive to produce.
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.860]   It's not one guy in a garage for three years writing a book,
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.300]   which then hopefully you can sell either by himself
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.980]   or with an agent.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.700]   TV requires a whole different infrastructure
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.900]   to make the advertising model work, because it's expensive.
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:43.980]   That's the difference between apps
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:46.100]   that are self-funded versus--
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.900]   right now, what was lost in a million dollars
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:49.700]   in episodes or something like that to produce.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.980]   Who's going to put the money up front for that?
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.220]   So you still need these big production companies.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.420]   The thing with apps is angry birds
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:59.460]   is probably created for 50K or whatever.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.660]   And it was like their 60th app, by the way.
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:03.780]   But there are TV shows that can be done as cheaply
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:04.620]   as angry birds.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:09.100]   I mean, if you think of something like Beavis and Buthead
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:12.060]   or an animated series or a reality show--
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:13.940]   Modern Family, which people love.
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:16.300]   You need serious professionals who write these things.
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:19.700]   But that's one type of TV that is inherently expensive.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.220]   Things like reality TV.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:24.060]   You could do a reality show for $1,000.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:24.860]   Please don't.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.340]   Please don't.
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:28.340]   I think we call it Twit, actually.
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:30.220]   Or Jersey Shore or something like that.
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.220]   Yeah, of course, a lot of money.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.980]   If everybody would please talk like this,
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.580]   I'd be much happier.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:35.300]   There's money in it.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:36.020]   There's money in it.
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:40.540]   Well, the thing is, once you see that there's money
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:44.020]   in creating these apps, you take the successful app
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.020]   and then you reinvest them.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:46.700]   I mean, it's just building a new business.
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:49.220]   It's not that you don't have to go back to ABC
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.660]   to make a $100 million show.
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.540]   You just have to make $100 million.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:54.660]   Then you can make $100 million.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:55.180]   Presumably.
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.820]   I mean, it's just a bit of a trash show.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.740]   Or you look at something like Annoying Orange this week.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.660]   I finally got the Cartoon Network deal.
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:03.780]   But you got really popular online and it's really funny.
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:05.260]   They must make millions of dollars on it.
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.420]   I don't believe they do.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:06.860]   I don't--
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:08.180]   Well, that's Google's fault then.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.340]   Well, I don't think--
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:10.460]   I don't think they make millions of dollars.
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.540]   But they're going everything.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:13.860]   Like, what's the-- do they just move from thing
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:15.220]   to thing that makes sense to them?
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:16.900]   So that's really-- to me, that's what's going to happen.
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:18.300]   You must know a little bit about this, Kevin.
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.220]   Because Revision3 has become an aggregator of YouTube's
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:22.020]   successes--
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:22.900]   Yeah, Epic Mealtime.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:24.620]   Epic Mealtime, an amazing show.
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.180]   They make a lot of money.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.340]   They make a lot of money.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:27.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:29.300]   From YouTube.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.980]   From Revision3 selling the sponsorships for them.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.420]   Do they make more money now than they
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:34.340]   were making as a YouTube hit?
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.180]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:35.460]   OK.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:36.740]   So maybe that is the case that you
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.220]   have to migrate then from YouTube.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:39.220]   But Google's put--
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:39.900]   Or it makes sense to them all.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:40.220]   --but Google's put--
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.740]   --sell your ads in their case because their content's free.
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:42.660]   Google has--
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:43.780]   Where it becomes sensible?
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:45.100]   You move to other things.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:45.620]   Not always.
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:47.500]   Google has put $100 million into all these channels,
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.700]   you know, Felicia Day and Shaquille O'Neal.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:50.540]   We'll see.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.660]   We'll see.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:52.940]   They're throwing stuff at the wall.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:53.580]   Why not?
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.300]   We can afford it.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.620]   How does Funny or Die do?
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:56.820]   Does anybody know how they financially are?
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:57.300]   Really?
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.020]   I think very well.
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:58.860]   So it's an interesting--
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.420]   We're making a Funny or Die for D10.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:01.220]   Are you?
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.380]   Peter's dived with me in it.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:04.540]   Oh, that's great.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:05.060]   Yeah.
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:05.700]   That's awesome.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.660]   No, I think Funny or Die does very well, as a matter of fact.
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:08.700]   I don't know the facts on it.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.620]   But I remember hearing that.
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.100]   Anything else you guys want to talk about?
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:14.420]   Any other big stories?
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:16.300]   Silver Lake Partners?
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.740]   Zynga.
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.380]   Zynga.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.380]   Zynga.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.100]   Maybe I'd like going on this week.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.140]   What's the-- they got Vanetta got a job, right?
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:24.860]   What happened?
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.460]   No, he left.
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:26.380]   He's gone.
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:27.420]   Yes, we wrote that story.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.940]   Is that a big deal?
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.620]   No, I think he sort of replaced himself.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.100]   And he's got a lot of money, and he wants to go do other things.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.420]   So they're going public, obviously,
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:37.100]   before the New Year, I think, before.
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:39.180]   So when you want to wait till that happened?
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.620]   No, because you have to tell them,
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.820]   because he had a big title.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.300]   I think he had to-- before they go on a road show.
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.060]   So he was planning to leave, you can't go on a road show
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:45.420]   and save.
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:47.540]   But by the way, our chief business officer's
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.220]   going to quit.
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:48.700]   Right.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:50.060]   Right.
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:53.180]   So if I were him, I'd keep it quiet till after the IPO.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.780]   Yeah, but then you're tricking investors, though.
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:56.860]   But I think you're-- even though he--
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:57.900]   Well, it's interesting.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.780]   If I thought in my head I was going to leave,
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:01.540]   but I just didn't tell anybody, that's bad.
[01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.420]   Oh, they were discussing it for a long time.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:05.220]   So they had a conversation.
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:05.860]   He blabbed.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.820]   He had to go.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:07.900]   He blabbed to me.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.500]   But no, he was thinking--
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.860]   like you said, if he was just thinking to it,
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.060]   he wasn't-- he wasn't--
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:17.260]   The guy responsible or involved in the taking back options
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:19.220]   from drawbacks.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.540]   That's a-- no.
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:22.820]   No, that was-- yes, yes and no, I suppose.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.620]   Yes and no.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.620]   But he gave up a lot.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:25.620]   That was a lovely maneuver.
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:26.620]   That was-- you know, you had to--
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:27.620]   So early employees who had options.
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:28.620]   Really?
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:29.620]   It happened to a lot of companies.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.620]   Companies take back the options.
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.620]   They do, but it's done in a different-- Mark just made a list.
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:33.620]   I think that was different.
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:33.620]   They do.
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:37.780]   They come to your office and say, yeah, you know those options
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.780]   that we gave you?
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:39.780]   What's happening?
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.780]   We'd like those back now.
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:42.780]   Well, there is a counter argument.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.580]   If someone is not contributing and they're sitting there
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.860]   vesting in peace, it's kind of a problem for--
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.860]   So that's why they get options in the first place.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.860]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:52.860]   I think that's because people don't do that in your round.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.340]   I think that's what G4 did to--
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.340]   You fire people.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:57.340]   Just out.
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:58.340]   You're out.
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:29:59.340]   You're out.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.340]   If you're out here, it's better for the person.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.340]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:02.340]   But I know a lot of companies do that.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.340]   All right.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:04.340]   I've had enough of this.
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:05.340]   I'm depressed.
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.780]   The whole world's going to hell.
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:08.780]   But thank God there's Twylights.
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:09.780]   This has even been drinking.
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:10.780]   Oh, yeah, that's it.
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.780]   I'm one of them sats.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:12.780]   We're not just adding enough.
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:13.780]   Or not enough.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.780]   One of the other.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:15.780]   I haven't finished this class.
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.780]   I'm still on that.
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:17.780]   And there's Twylight.
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:18.780]   Please rush out.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:24.220]   Harris Swisher has to go get her now penguin loving children.
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.220]   And my mom.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.140]   They're going to want penguins now.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.500]   Oh, they've got a lot of things.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:29.500]   They're so cute.
[01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.500]   They are cute.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.060]   They're so cute.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.500]   Allthingsd.com and the 10th anniversary.
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.500]   10th anniversary.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.860]   And it's the 20th anniversary of Walt's column, if you can believe it.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:38.860]   Wow.
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:40.980]   It's the 5th anniversary of our site and the 10th anniversary of the conference.
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:41.980]   So we're--
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:42.980]   It's TechCrunch dead now.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.980]   Oh, I'm not going to comment on that.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:44.980]   Throw them out there.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.980]   You're just bading her.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:46.980]   Come on.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:47.980]   Come on, care.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:48.980]   Come on.
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:49.980]   You're doing some issues.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:50.980]   I mean, Sarah left.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:51.980]   Sarah left?
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:52.980]   Yes.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:53.980]   Heather might be leaving.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.980]   But Sarah hadn't been around for ages because she had a baby.
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.980]   But Sarah left.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:57.980]   Sarah left?
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:58.980]   Yes.
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:30:59.980]   Heather might be leaving.
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:01.980]   But Sarah hadn't been around for ages because she had a baby.
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:02.980]   But Sarah left.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:03.980]   No, she was coming back January 1st.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:04.980]   So she decided not to come back.
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:05.980]   Indeed.
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:06.980]   Who else is leaving?
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:07.980]   Is there a hemorrhaging of talent?
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:08.980]   You know--
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:09.980]   MG is barely writing for them anymore.
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:10.980]   He's a columnist now.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:11.980]   I thought MG is awesome.
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:12.980]   I love MG.
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:13.980]   MG is a superstar.
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:14.980]   But all he's writing now is an apple column because he's a VC.
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:15.980]   Interesting.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:16.980]   So AOL killed it, huh?
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:18.980]   You know, these media properties have lives.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.980]   It's just faster on the internet, I think.
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:22.980]   It was a lot built around Michael Aaron.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.980]   It was Mike.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:24.980]   You know what?
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:25.980]   You Mike leaves, you don't have anything to be on.
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:26.980]   It's tough.
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:27.980]   It's tough when you build those kind of things.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:28.980]   If you're not building a larger--
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:29.980]   What's Giga on without Omelik?
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:30.980]   What's Tech Crunched?
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:31.980]   You know, hang on.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.980]   These guys-- these sites have good writers.
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:34.980]   I mean, they have great writers.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:35.980]   It's not to diminish them.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:36.980]   Yes, they do.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:37.980]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:38.980]   I mean, I think you can do it beyond that.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:40.980]   I mean, look, I had a stroke and they did all you should eat just fine.
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.980]   I mean, it's just like-- you can build these things.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:46.980]   I mean, Kevin's running-- As your mother says, the graveyard's filled with indispensable people.
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.980]   So, grandma, I'm saying, you can build it depending on how you build a media property.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:50.980]   It can't go on without you or not.
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:51.980]   I'm trying.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:52.980]   I'm trying.
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:53.980]   Hey, you know who my successor's going to be?
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:54.980]   This cat, Tom Merritt.
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.980]   Tom, what's coming up this week?
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:58.980]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.980]   Here's a look at what's coming up in the week ahead.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:02.980]   We'll be covering some of this stuff on Tech News today.
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.980]   A lot of stuff going on today.
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:06.980]   The AT&T curve 9360 comes out.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:08.980]   AT&T's launching the HTC Titan.
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:11.980]   Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword comes to the US.
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:12.980]   And Canada.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:18.980]   Also, US net neutrality rules are in effect as of today.
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:21.980]   Happy 26th birthday to Windows.
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:27.980]   Coming up on Wednesday, November 23rd, the Gmail app for Blackberry reaches the end of life.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:29.980]   And then that's it.
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:34.980]   Thursday, November 24th, it's Thanksgiving in the US, so we will not respond to any of your emails or phone calls.
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:39.980]   And then Friday, November 25th, Black Friday, that's when everybody in the US goes out shopping.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:47.980]   It's also when the 25th anniversary Zelda edition of Nintendo 3DS comes to European shops and the iPhone 4S will hit India.
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:48.980]   Let's look at the week ahead.
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:49.980]   Let's talk about that.
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:50.980]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:51.980]   Thank you, Tom Merritt.
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:52.980]   Tom Merritt is a course the host of...
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:53.980]   You're welcome.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:54.980]   Tom Merritt.
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.980]   He loops, by the way.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:57.980]   He's a host of TNT.
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:32:58.980]   Does that every Monday through Friday?
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:32:59.980]   Little loop.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:02.980]   30 Pacific, the 530 Eastern on Twitch.tv.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.980]   If you're outside of the US 230 Pacific would be, I'm going to do some math now,
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:11.980]   2230 U.T.C. Black Friday is not the biggest shopping day of the year.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.980]   No, I covered retail for seven years.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:14.980]   It's actually the Saturday before Christmas.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:15.980]   Makes much more sense.
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:16.980]   I never understood who wants to go out.
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:17.980]   It's not.
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:18.980]   It's a myth.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:19.980]   It's one of those mythologies.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:20.980]   And Cyber Monday is even a bigger myth.
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:21.980]   It's a bit...
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:22.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:25.980]   The people stay that don't shop because they're going to have faster than that at work.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:27.980]   They're waiting for the very last sales in the first place.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:28.980]   Yeah, of course.
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:29.980]   I should Christmas Eve.
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   Although now it's going to be Christmas Eve actually because Christmas is on Sunday.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:33.980]   It's Christmas Sunday.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:34.980]   Cyber Monday is still a little...
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:35.980]   Oh, it's a double...
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.820]   On Friday and Monday.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:38.820]   Friday and Saturday for Christmas-
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:40.240]   - Friday in like late '90s.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.480]   - The information superhighway.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.180]   Some day will come to every home
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:47.200]   in the United States and then you'll all be driving
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.200]   on the information.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.920]   I remember doing something.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.400]   There was like a...
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.760]   Are you in the driveway on the information superhighway?
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:56.780]   Or, I don't know.
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:57.700]   - Taking the off-ran.
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:58.700]   - Dayoff-ran.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:01.700]   Christmas Eve was when I shop.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:03.860]   I do, I like to be there with all the other husbands.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:04.780]   - What do you get, any?
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:05.620]   Sorry.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.820]   - Do you have that electric power swizzle stick?
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:10.700]   'Cause that is an awesome holiday gift this year.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:12.020]   - I don't want to Kindle fire.
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:12.860]   - You're gonna go Kindle fires,
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:13.700]   which you're gonna get.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:14.540]   - Get the up.
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:15.380]   - You can have my fire.
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:16.220]   - Up, yeah.
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.060]   - Yeah, I am getting the up.
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:17.900]   I'm getting the up.
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.220]   - You know, there's apparently,
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.820]   there's a big failure rate on these things.
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:22.660]   You know why?
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:23.500]   'Cause people shower with them.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.340]   They say they're waterproofing on you.
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:25.180]   - You lost your dog.
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:26.740]   - Yeah, I lost my dongle.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:27.580]   - Oh dear.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.860]   - I already got three for three or 10 bucks.
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:30.700]   - Oh really?
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:31.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:32.780]   - You lost your dongle.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:34.060]   Back to Twilight again.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:37.300]   - You lost his dongle on this particular episode of Twilight.
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.660]   - I always lose my dongle.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:39.740]   - No, I think these are pretty cool.
[01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:40.620]   - I want wireless sync though.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.460]   That's the only thing.
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.300]   - Yeah, that's what the Fitbit had.
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:45.260]   - You know, a lot of people complained about that saying
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:47.460]   this was a company famous for wireless
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:48.860]   and they didn't have wireless.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:50.300]   - It's a company famous for headsets.
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.140]   - I know, but they're wireless.
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:51.980]   - Just talking about the job.
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:52.820]   - Just talking about the job.
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:53.660]   - Nevermind.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:54.500]   - You know what's interesting?
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:55.500]   Philippe Kahn.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.340]   That's what's interesting.
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.180]   - He's involved in the motion.
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:00.300]   - He actually demoed that a day for a couple of years ago.
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:02.060]   We had someone running around the audience,
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:03.060]   like a runner.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:06.060]   - So Philippe Kahn created Turbo Pascal.
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:09.340]   - Right, and then at Borland many, many moons ago.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:12.940]   - Then he was, his wife was giving birth
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.180]   and he had a camera phone,
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.140]   very early feature phone with a camera and he said,
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:17.940]   "Why can't I share this with other people?"
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.060]   He came up with the basic technology
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:23.540]   that is in every freaking camera phone made today
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.740]   licensed to Philippe.
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:25.580]   And now this.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:26.420]   - He's a character.
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:27.980]   - He's great, plays sax too.
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:28.820]   - He does, he was.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:29.660]   - We should get Philippe.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.060]   Can we get Philippe on the show?
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.380]   - Something in Hawaii.
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:34.220]   - No, no, no, no, he's Santa Cruz.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.700]   - He's 24 footer.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.580]   - People hate him because he's got like,
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.060]   he's putting millions of dollars in the 24 foot sailboats.
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:42.540]   And beating him.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:44.060]   And beating him because of course you can't,
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.420]   you could win if you put money into those things.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:50.100]   I was sailing on the bay last year and Philippe's team went by.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:50.940]   - Wow.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.940]   - Yeah, they all have matching slickers.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:56.580]   - You need matching slickers.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:58.300]   - We should all have blazers.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.100]   We could all wear,
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.100]   and we'd do a twit blazers during this show.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:01.940]   - Uniforms.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:02.940]   - Uniforms would be great.
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.100]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.900]   We do this show three p.m. Pacific on Sundays,
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:08.700]   six p.m. Eastern time,
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:12.300]   2300 UTC, so you can watch it late at night.
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:13.540]   But you know, if you don't have to watch it live,
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:14.380]   it's fun to watch it live.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.020]   When we watch the chat room, we actually have an,
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.740]   you know, an interaction with them.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:20.580]   We look at them, we see what they're saying, we go.
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:21.820]   And then we move on.
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:23.860]   And you could be part of that by coming in live.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:25.580]   But if you don't, don't worry, we record it.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.020]   And you can get video and audio after the fact.
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:29.220]   That's all at twit.tv.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.660]   Thanks to my producer, Eileen Rivera,
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.700]   who makes this show sing.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.020]   - She actually does everything.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.580]   She books the guests. - Fantastic.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:37.300]   - She puts together the stories.
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:38.140]   - And she's. - And she's also,
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.780]   I'm going to remind you really quickly about
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.180]   twit.tv/bestow.
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.260]   - Oh yeah, we gotta do a holiday specials.
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:46.340]   We're gonna take the week after Christmas off as always.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.740]   And what we like to do those weeks is do a best of,
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:52.220]   we have a great twit holiday special on Christmas Eve.
