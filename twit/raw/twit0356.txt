[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.920]   It's time for Twit this week.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.720]   In Tech this week, a great panel
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.320]   to discuss the news of the day, starting with John C.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.880]   Devorak, who is in an unusually feisty mode,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.400]   despite lacking the Beach Boys shirt.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.360]   Ah, yes, I know.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.880]   Well, I was expecting to pick one up while I was here.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.360]   Oh, yes.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.520]   Somebody had promised me one F so--
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.840]   Oh, really?
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   Oh, I was going to give you a horror wardrobe.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.480]   I also promised you a roast beef sandwich,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.320]   I didn't deliver it.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.160]   Yes, this is true.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.560]   Apparently, I am in fact reneging.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.400]   I don't really take any of this that seriously.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.960]   Good, thank you, because I forgot.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.440]   And I will.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.960]   But I will.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.280]   That remind me, somebody, that I need to get something for John.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.920]   Would you like a pair of panties, I think?
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.480]   No, I don't--
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   Rayfans.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.760]   Rayfans a pair?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.240]   I'm doing a giveaway.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.280]   Rayf Needlemana.com here.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.320]   I have a pair, but not panties.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.400]   Editor at large@cnet.com.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.720]   He also hosts the reporters' roundtable podcast
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.520]   and did a video on the Goody bag, which we'll find out more
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.960]   about from All Things D, The All Things D Conference.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.160]   I'm glad you were there, because you can tell us all about that.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.640]   It's a good show.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680]   Yeah, the Tim Cook got a lot of attention.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.800]   We'll talk about that in a minute.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.200]   Also here, and I think this is your first time on Twitter.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.000]   If I'm not wrong, Doc Serals.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.680]   It's my first time in video.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.840]   I've been on it early on.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   Early days.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.440]   Early days.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.960]   In the lows and early days, yeah.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.200]   It's so great to have you back.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.560]   Doc.serals.com.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.360]   Doc is an internet visionary, one of the three authors
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.600]   of the Cloutrain Manifesto now more than 10 years ago.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.520]   There were four.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.480]   You, David Weinberger.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.600]   Chris Locke and Rick Levine.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.080]   Chris Locke.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.600]   Rick Levine is the shy one.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.440]   He's the one who doesn't hog a spotlight.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.000]   But yeah, there are four of us.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.600]   I like Doc, because he used to be in radio that always makes me
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.320]   feel good about somebody.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.960]   And--
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.640]   You take that right of it.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.360]   His new book is called The Intention Economy.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.880]   You want to tell us a little about that?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.360]   What is that?
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.400]   There it is, right there.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.160]   OK.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.680]   Of course, it looks backwards on my screen.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.240]   It's from Harvard Business Review Press.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.120]   I've been hanging out.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.280]   There's almost reflex.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   For the last six years, I've been hanging out at the Berkman
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.960]   Center at Harvard, where I've been working on a project
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.000]   to encourage development of tools that help customers,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.800]   help themselves, make them independent of sellers
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.120]   that want to trap them and follow them around
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.960]   and the rest of it.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.280]   Basically trying to improve markets from the customer side
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.800]   rather than from the seller side.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.120]   And we've got about 40 developers so far doing really
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.680]   good early work, I think.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.560]   And so the book is partly a report on the work
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.200]   they've been doing and partly the blue sky
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.280]   at the end of the cycle that I see coming.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.840]   So it's one of my theories is that a free customer
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.160]   is more valuable than a captive one.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.320]   If you listen to business talk to itself,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.800]   yeah, that we, when I say we, I mean business
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.600]   and on the business side, tend to talk about customers
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.640]   as these things that we want to lock in and own
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.960]   and manage and control--
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   Look at Apple.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.440]   They do everything they care.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.040]   You're acquiring a customer like their slaves or cattle.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.760]   Churn is the worst thing possible.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   It's a customer leaving.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   Oh my god, we've--
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   Right.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   And again, we spend, we being business
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.720]   against, spend about $18 billion a year on CRM systems,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.840]   which by the way, customers have nothing to do with.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.080]   I mean, they're trapped in those things too.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.520]   They just basically give you call centers and junk mail.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.000]   So how can we control things on our side?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.880]   If I want to change my address once for all the entities
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.600]   that I deal with, how can I do that?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.240]   If I want to set my own terms of service,
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.640]   if I want to advertise what I'm looking for
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.520]   without having to go to one site to do it,
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.440]   I can do it across many and respect
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.560]   that the relationships they already have, for example.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.040]   So let's say I want a certain kind of arcane car.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.760]   I can do it anonymously with everybody,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.160]   but the outfits that I have an actual relationship with.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.880]   And I can control that relationship.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.200]   Well, you're just a goddamn hippie.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.280]   Yeah, you never get over that shit.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   That's right.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280]   (laughing)
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.960]   This is the case really is in many ways
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.200]   that what you predicted with the Clue Train Manifesto,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.000]   that the internet would really transform consumers and workers.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.080]   That wasn't fast enough.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.520]   I mean, you know, so.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.120]   Right. Let's speed it up.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.320]   Everybody's had a genuflected in the gentle direction
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.120]   of Clue Train and it went ahead and did the market
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.960]   as usual.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.480]   Like, hey, markets and carversations,
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.880]   we could talk at people now.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.080]   You know, we can follow them with cookies
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.080]   and tracking beacons and then get social with them
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.120]   when they least expect it.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.880]   (laughing)
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.920]   So it's true.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   You really only hear from a company
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.680]   when you say something bad about them on Twitter
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   and then they appear magically.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.160]   Oh, we care now.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's really sweet.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.840]   It's not perfect.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.760]   So it's like that.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.720]   Well, it's great to have all three of you.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.600]   It's a big week.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.680]   There's lots to talk about.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.520]   And I guess we should probably start with,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.720]   because I see Rafe using it.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.280]   The wonderful Windows 8.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.120]   Oh, it's great.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.280]   Consumer preview shipped, what, you don't, you're not thrilled?
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.360]   It's hard.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.800]   I'm trying to get excited about it.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   It's just not happening.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.920]   I think if I had a tablet,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.560]   I might be a little less meh.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.480]   But on a laptop, I mean, obviously the laptop,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.320]   the desktop is dead.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.160]   The laptop is--
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.800]   Would you call it as this guy here,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.240]   an unmitigated disaster that could decidedly hurt
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.200]   the company in its future?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.040]   Did I say that?
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.560]   Unmitigated.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.800]   I was thinking about, I was actually driving when I said,
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.760]   unmitigated.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.880]   That's the word I want.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.720]   (laughing)
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.960]   The only way that it makes any sense.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.000]   It's a gutsy move.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.160]   It is a tablet operating.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.040]   It's a gutsy move.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.160]   It's a stuck onto a laptop.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.160]   Well, that's what, you know, and--
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.280]   It is a focus group move.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.120]   Well, what?
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.200]   I think it's a brave thing for Microsoft to say,
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.040]   "Look, we're gonna cut off the past."
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.280]   We're gonna cut off, yeah.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.520]   Cut off our whatever.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.360]   And that's for sure.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.840]   And we're gonna try something completely new.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.720]   They said we're gonna reimagine Windows.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.240]   They did, you can't deny that.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.400]   They reimagined it.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.360]   It's risky.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.720]   We were talking on Windows Weekly
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.640]   with Paul Throughton-Marry Joe Foley this week.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.640]   And they said, I think what a lot of people are saying,
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.120]   which is business will just ignore it.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.360]   And the next business upgrade will be Windows 7,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.600]   and they'll stay with that for years.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.720]   Well, I was hoping, 'cause I had played with the dev version,
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.280]   that I could hang out in the desktop,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.400]   and I didn't have to worry about this Metro idiocy.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.280]   But no, no matter what you do,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.600]   it's just gonna throw you back into the Metro interface
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.800]   whether you like it or not.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.640]   And then--
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.440]   I keep bouncing into desktop for me.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.280]   I tried to say--
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.240]   Well, give me your system out to give you mine.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.640]   And anyway, the thing that kind of,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.040]   the whole thing is kind of,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.680]   by the way, I ran Chrome on the desktop,
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.080]   and it killed the whole system.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.920]   Oh, good.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   Yeah, I think that was on purpose.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.160]   Windows ain't done till Chrome won't run.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.000]   Anyway.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.080]   That's an old lotus joke.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.440]   One of the things that struck me,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.920]   I don't dislike it.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.960]   I think Geeks might kind of say,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.080]   well, this is cool, this is different,
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.680]   this is new, this is innovative.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.200]   They're trying stuff, but it is not,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.360]   it lacks some--
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   Charm.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.200]   Well, it's certainly--
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.120]   It has charms on the right hand side.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.280]   Those are called charms.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.560]   It has no soul, it's a soulless, cold product
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.720]   that has no feeling.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.800]   Windows 7.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.120]   Windows 7 has at least got some,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.360]   you know, modicum of friendliness.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.120]   This thing is just minimalist, cold--
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.200]   It's screw you.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.280]   From that perspective, it's beautiful.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.120]   From a minimalist--
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.680]   Yeah, from an off-your-field spectrum.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.520]   Collecting a card.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.000]   Well, they call it Metro because it's supposed to be
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.840]   like Subway signs, it's supposed to be kind of iconic.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.880]   It is no frills.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.440]   One thing I do like is they've abandoned the skeumorphism
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.360]   that Apple came to say.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.880]   So I'm just gonna use that word.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   What is thinking into skeumorphism?
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.880]   It's non-scurimorphism.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.720]   That's what they've been saying about you, Leo.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.960]   Say it, say it, I have no idea.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.560]   We have no idea, we just like the word.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.400]   It means leather stitching on your calendar app
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.480]   or torn off, the remains of torn off calendar pages.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.400]   You like, I've heard another guy talk about this.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.280]   It's a ridiculous idea, Apple's gotten more and more into it,
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.760]   which is, by the way, I think Johnny I have this week
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.520]   implied that he thought it was stupid.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.040]   The chief designer at Apple doesn't like it for you, so.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.880]   Good for you, man.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.840]   I think this is what Microsoft's doing,
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.960]   is they're eliminating the frippery,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.480]   but what it is not is it's not discoverable.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.760]   There's moves on this.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   Like if you move the--
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.720]   Yeah, there are secret moves that you have to make.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.280]   And like the desktop is down here in the corner
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.520]   and the charms are over here on this side.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.080]   And you got to move the mouse just right.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.640]   Yeah, why would you know this without--
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.480]   You wouldn't.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.320]   And the window--
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.160]   So why is it--
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.360]   Well, I'll give you a name after the simplicity of the subway.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.200]   It's just a measure--
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.240]   Right, there's no map.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.080]   You need a map.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.920]   So watch this, type CMD.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.680]   Type it, just without doing anything, GMD.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.560]   Oh my goodness.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   It launches.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.200]   There's how you get to a command line, or anything,
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.080]   as you type the first few letters and you hit return.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.280]   How about format C?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.040]   Do you type that and see what happens?
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.760]   RM-F.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.320]   Oh, there's an app directory here.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.960]   There's an app--
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.440]   Well, see, it's not discoverable.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.400]   It's not discoverable.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.000]   Neither is Apple.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.800]   Neither is OS 10.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.080]   Well, at least you have a menu bar,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.920]   which you can grab.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.960]   But there are a lot of hidden things in Apple
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   that are totally not discoverable.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.440]   Not discoverable.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.360]   But the point here is that the learning curve,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   especially in business, is going to be miserable.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.560]   But there are no business apps here.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.520]   I mean, all the apps that run on Metro are--
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.520]   the Metro apps, there are things like news--
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   Fullscreen, travel, fullscreen.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.280]   Yeah, fast, fullscreen, fullscreen, news,
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.160]   fullscreen, crap, crap.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.840]   Messages, right.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.680]   You won't say it.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.400]   So business apps, if you want, still run
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.840]   under the whole desktop UI.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.040]   So you've got this weird operating system.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.760]   Fullscreen, crap.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.720]   We're going to abbreviate to FAT.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.240]   I made this mention this in my column,
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.400]   and you set it on your other show.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   So when you use this, you'll be a fabulous point.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.600]   You've got a 27-inch screen, and you hit one of these things.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.360]   Boom, the whole screen's got one--
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.960]   The weather, it's boring.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.440]   It's fine on a little laptop, but on a giant screen,
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:22.800]   it is an--
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.440]   It is a tablet operating system.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.520]   It's a tablet OS.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:25.880]   Yes.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.160]   And they're enforcing it.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.440]   Now, I've been trying really hard.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.560]   I like that logo on the shirt, but it was--
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.640]   You just put me into this thing,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   and I don't know how to get back.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.880]   Press the Windows-- oh, you don't have a Windows key.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.280]   No, you--
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.120]   Press your command button.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.240]   Function, command, Y.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.520]   No, just command.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.240]   Oh, that did it.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.800]   Command always brings you back to the start.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.360]   Oh, thank you.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.280]   I can help you use this today on the best thing.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.800]   I want to like it.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.280]   OK.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.640]   And I want to give Microsoft a little bit of credit
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.720]   for doing something new and different.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.160]   But I agree with you.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.880]   This will be an unmitigated disaster,
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.960]   because I just think people are going to look at this
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.120]   and go, what the hell is this?
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.000]   Why will it be?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.560]   Well, because people, you'll be able to buy a Windows 8
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.440]   tablet for $200, which will be way under what you can get
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.280]   a Mac tablet for.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.280]   This is a low-end product.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.160]   It'll be worth every penny.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.680]   This is exactly.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.560]   You can buy the Google Fire for $200.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.640]   Do you want it?
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.320]   People want the iPad.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:14.960]   It's not different.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.720]   It's the same.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.320]   Cheap is cheap.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.080]   I do have to say there's a debate going on--
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.040]   according to Paul Therat-- there's
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.640]   a debate going on at Microsoft about whether, when
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.000]   you launch this for the first time,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.120]   you get a movie about how to use it.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.160]   And some people do not want to do that.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.840]   And some people do.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.720]   Apple did that with a change to scroll.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   They would not let you use OS 10 Lion
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.680]   until you watched a movie about how scroll works.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.520]   And demonstrated--
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.640]   It broke scroll.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.840]   And demonstrated that you knew how.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.040]   You actually had a test.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.840]   That should be a rule.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.680]   Every time you break an operating system,
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.600]   you have to put a blocker video in place
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.120]   that people have to pass before you can use the operating.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.080]   Well, that's why some people say, no, no, we shouldn't do that.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.800]   But I think it's a mission that is a mission.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.080]   You just load the operating system.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   Meanwhile, somebody's breaking into the house.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.240]   You got to get to the computer and call the cops.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.320]   You're one of your VOIP lines.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.240]   Talk this may be an example of a company--
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.000]   You're shot dead.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.040]   Not listening to its customers.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.960]   I don't know.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.480]   I mean, obviously, you don't really care.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.240]   You're not using Windows.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.880]   I don't care.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   No.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.880]   I just--
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.480]   It isn't carrying things the whole thing.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.920]   But it's the thing, though.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.120]   Rafe is right that Apple is just as obscure about some
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.760]   of that stuff.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.960]   I actually bought one of those trackpad things
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.640]   as a--
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.880]   Oh, those gestures.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's impossible.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.640]   I couldn't use it.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.680]   I mean, use four fingers for this or three for that
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.400]   or you wipe left and right.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.560]   And it's-- it was all like everything.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.240]   Every gesture is cleaning the thing.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.800]   I mean, that's kind of what it is.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.840]   And it makes--
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.600]   You have a very clean trackpad.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.800]   Yeah, you get an excellent trackpad.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.280]   The dust is not settled on it.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.680]   I gave up and went back to a mouse
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   and I gave it to my kid.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.200]   But did you--
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.000]   Well, here's the test.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.800]   Your kid knows how to use it.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.520]   Oh, I'm sure he does.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.520]   Yes, he doesn't go out to it.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.280]   But he has the magic mouse, too.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.640]   And that has some of that same gesturable business
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.920]   on the top with no physical sense of what it's doing.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920]   Why?
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.840]   Mark, why are these companies that are successful companies
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.640]   going down this path?
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.920]   Because what they're trying to do is really hard.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.640]   Making something that does all this stuff that
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.280]   is instantly understandable and usable with a common library
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.000]   of commands and gestures is unbelievably difficult.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.240]   Apple still doesn't have it right.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.960]   Every time they come up with the new OS,
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.040]   they change the desktop or the spaces or the dashboard
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.640]   or whatever.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.480]   They keep mixing it up.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.880]   They still haven't figured it out.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.480]   They haven't figured it out.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.640]   Microsoft now, this is a 1.0 of a completely new UI paradigm.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.120]   They're not going to figure it out for years if they ever do.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.600]   Chrome OS didn't figure it out.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.920]   They thought they'd have a full screen system.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.240]   They're like, no, that's not going to work.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.720]   Now we're going to have Windows and Chrome OS.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.080]   Android, I don't even want to go there.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.720]   I mean, nobody has figured out how to make this complex stuff
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.840]   work.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.040]   Paul Therat also points out--
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.160]   Worked fine before.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.880]   Microsoft has been furiously ripping legacy code out
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.920]   of Windows so that companies that want to make products,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.160]   for instance, the Re-enable to Start menu can't.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.200]   Oh, that's fine.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.440]   They are so committed to this.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.080]   By the way, Ashton Kutcher and I think I want to say hi to Ashton.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.680]   There he is.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.200]   Hey, Ashton.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.320]   How are you doing?
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.480]   They are working so hard.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.840]   I don't know.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.120]   I just noticed.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.040]   They are working so hard not only to change this,
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.240]   but to lock you in, like, oh, don't let anybody have a tool
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.760]   that will bring it back to the old ways.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.000]   We're going to strip that code out.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.840]   We're getting more like Apple and--
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.920]   It's time for Linux.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.720]   It's very Apple-y.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.920]   It is time for Linux.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.120]   Is Linux ready?
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.800]   No, it's-- well, it is, but nobody wants to believe it.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.320]   Why?
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.120]   He accompanied a step forward and said we're going to--
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.280]   What do you talk-- you've got the command line.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.720]   If you really want to go down that road,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.760]   I mean, both OS 10 and Windows--
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.240]   I like using the mouse and port, moving things around.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.560]   I like drag it up.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.080]   So--
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.400]   Or Acer or somebody like that needs to step up.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.680]   I think they don't want to sell.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.360]   If you don't want to sell.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.800]   Dell right now, suffering like it is, odd to say, you know what,
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.200]   screw it.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.400]   We're just going to go with Linux now.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.240]   We're going to-- you know, we'll keep doing the Windows stuff,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.120]   but we're going to start doing some really cool stuff with Linux
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.440]   so we can work with Android, too.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.920]   Walmart can go back to the Windows PC.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.320]   Why not?
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.520]   Actually, Photoshop doesn't run on Linux,
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.360]   and that's the problem.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.480]   That is a problem.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.320]   GIMP runs on it, and it's a substitute,
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.520]   but it's not quite as good.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   Somebody made an interesting point.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.640]   I wish I could remember where I probably
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.920]   saw it on a hacker news.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.320]   That there hasn't been really any new--
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.720]   remember, there used to be new OSs?
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.920]   That it wasn't unusual for BOS to come along and BOSs.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.480]   Yeah, but does React OS that's been trying to get traction?
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.720]   So there are new OSs?
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   Well--
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   Or is that a Linux pair?
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.520]   No, it's not.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.320]   It's a clone.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.880]   It's supposed to run Windows 7 apps.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.720]   It's called React OS, and they're on .3 alpha.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   And it's been around for, I don't know, five, six, seven years.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.920]   I don't know how long.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.280]   And I can't get it to run.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.320]   But, well, I tell you, this is not a new OS
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.200]   because it's trying to provide an operating system which
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.040]   is binary compatible with Windows.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.600]   So that's a slavish-- that's slavish kind of--
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.200]   Well, it'd be nice to have an OS head of Vayion.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.680]   I haven't seen some of this that runs Photoshop, for example.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.000]   Do you use Photoshop?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   For what?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.080]   He likes to put monkeys' heads on beautiful women's--
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.120]   You'll see on Monday.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.880]   Oh, no.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.880]   OK.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   So I take a picture of this man.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   I take a picture of this man.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.720]   He'll be on the top of the blog.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.880]   Oh, great.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.040]   Question my Photoshop usage.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.160]   He made a video once of Bill Gates swallowing for 15 minutes.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.280]   That was a good one.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.000]   He did a speech.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.680]   It was at CES, I believe.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.400]   And he swallowed so much that I took the whole speech
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.680]   which was about an hour and 10 minutes.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.880]   And I just put the swallows--
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.440]   Just swallow after swallow.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   You can't wait that with a hairball.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.120]   There's like seven minutes of swallowing.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.280]   It is actually quite amusing.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.680]   It's nice because you deserve Linux.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.760]   10,000 years ago when I was in radio,
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.480]   we did this with a Ted Kennedy speech
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.440]   because all the Kennedy's ago--
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.920]   Right, right.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.240]   --between every other word.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.960]   And we cut everything with the "us."
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.600]   And it sounded like a sheep.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.760]   Let me see that.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.960]   I will-- [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.360]   All right, we've just gotten started.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.720]   The ball has just begun to roll.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.400]   And already, it's careening around like a mad cow disease.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.120]   Or something.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:24.520]   John C. de Vorek, Ralph Needleman, Doc Serrels, Leila Port.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.680]   And go to my PC.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.840]   Are you could be sitting there--
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.400]   I wouldn't even know accessing--
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:29.900]   I am.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.400]   I'm accessing--
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:30.900]   Your home computer.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.000]   I'm accessing something on the cloud as we speak.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.040]   Putting something exactly?
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.120]   Called the chat room.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.800]   Oh, the chat room.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.440]   Well, you could do that with go to my PC, too.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.120]   Actually, you know what?
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.640]   And interesting, you used to go to my PC.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.520]   Would be as a VPN.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.560]   You're in an open access spot.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.880]   You don't know what's going on.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.400]   You want to have some privacy.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.600]   Use go to my PC to surf to your office computer.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.040]   And then surf to the outside world.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.960]   And you're completely secure.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.560]   It's wonderful.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.320]   Unless somebody's spying on your office.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.160]   That's another matter.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.880]   Yes.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.760]   Go to my PC.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.160]   It is the best remote access solution from Citrix, Mac,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.400]   and PC, and from your iPad and your iPhone, too.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.880]   Now, that is awesome.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.800]   To actually run Windows on your iPhone,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.400]   it's a little weird, I admit.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.080]   But you can send and receive email, run any program,
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.200]   access all those network resources, just as if you were at work.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.800]   You never have to rush back to work
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.640]   because you forgot something or you need something
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.800]   or they're calling from work.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.560]   You could do it all on the road at a hotel,
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.800]   an internet cafe, anywhere from the pool.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.440]   They like to there.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.840]   I wish I were doing this from the pool.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.040]   We should do this show from the pools.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.840]   OK.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.840]   I'd like to do that.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.240]   Love to see you on a Speedo.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.160]   Go to my PC to their shop.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.280]   I wear Speedos.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.040]   I bet you do.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.760]   But they're actually the shoes.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.640]   I use it as a gag.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.280]   You wear Speedo shoes.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.800]   I have a pair of-- these aren't them.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.840]   These are Sketchers, another low end brand.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.360]   So I got these Speedo shoes.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.520]   I'm wearing Speedos.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.840]   And it really impresses the girls
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.680]   until I show them that's just the shoes.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.240]   I don't think girls like Speedos.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.080]   I don't think so either.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.120]   I mean, girl, I'm in.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.960]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.120]   Click the try it free button.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.520]   It's like Brute or Axe.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.200]   Girls don't like that.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.720]   Axe.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.240]   Have you ever asked about Axe?
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.400]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.600]   Click the try it free button.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.960]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.440]   And you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   Just do me a favor.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.760]   Try and see.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.800]   Let me know what you think.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.680]   Go to my PC.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.760]   All right, I'm going to stick this here.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.920]   So we're going to have like five commercials today.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.840]   Could be the more the merrier.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.120]   I got to pay your salary, John.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.000]   Mm.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.760]   Did you see--
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.800]   The Speedo Dextice.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.160]   So first of all, we get the revelation that Stuxnet, which
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.840]   was a virus that kind of took over the world a little bit,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.320]   was actually created by the United States and Israel.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.880]   We kind of knew this because it was originally targeted.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.400]   We suspected it.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.760]   We suspected it was targeted at the Iranian nuclear plants,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.720]   nuclear refinement facilities.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.680]   And it actually was designed to bring down the centrifuges
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.840]   there.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.480]   But-- and I like Joe Biden's quote in this New York Times
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.200]   article-- apparently it was modified in some way
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.800]   and it escaped.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.720]   It broke through its cage and escaped into the wild.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.640]   You know what's funny is I just saw a rise of the planet
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.720]   of the apes last night?
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.400]   Same thing.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:05.840]   Exactly.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.560]   Same thing.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.480]   We think there was a-- this is one of the briefers
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.600]   telling the president, President Obama.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.320]   We think there was a modification done by the Israelis.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.240]   And we don't know if we were part of that activity.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.120]   They don't know.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.440]   The brief and the principal.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.520]   Blame the Jews.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.440]   Mr. Obama, according to officials in the "Roomaster"
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.560]   series of questions, fearful that the code could do damage
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.880]   outside the plant.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.920]   The answers came back in hedged terms.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   Vice President Biden fumed.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.520]   It's got to be the Israelis, he said.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.240]   They went to the far New York Times.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.320]   Oh, geez.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:37.840]   No wonder.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.520]   No wonder.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.720]   So the way they got it in, first of all, the Israeli--
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.640]   I mean, the Iranian nuclear refinement plant
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.520]   was air gapped from the outside world.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.040]   Right.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.560]   In other words, there's no connection to the outside.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:50.760]   Right.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.800]   So they had to figure out a way to get this incredibly advanced
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.040]   engineered virus into a network that was not connected
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.840]   to the rest of the world.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.080]   And how did they do that?
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.440]   They relied on the stupidity and gullibility of human beings.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.400]   How else would you do it?
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:04.920]   Another quote.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.840]   The US B-Pours plugged me in.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.240]   Exactly.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.200]   Thumb drives turned out to be crucial in spreading
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.640]   the first variance of the computer worm.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.160]   Quote.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.360]   It turns out there's always an idiot around who
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.040]   doesn't think much about the thumb drive in their hand.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.480]   That's what I said.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.080]   That's the quote.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.720]   The program was originally authorized by George W. Bush.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.440]   That's how old it is.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.880]   And when Obama took office that was
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.920]   called Olympic Games, Operation Olympic Games,
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.560]   that's confusing.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.080]   Well, it's not that confusing if you
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.480]   think of the fact that the Rockefeller Foundation came out
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.040]   with a report with five or six different scenarios
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.520]   for the end of the next few years,
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.520]   including a scenario about the Olympic Games, which
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.440]   includes 13,000 people being killed in the stadium
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.640]   by a terrorist attack, which is one of the reasons
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.080]   that the British overmanned it.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.680]   So this is why in 2012 in London,
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.720]   this is what they're afraid of.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.640]   And this is why they released Stuxnet.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.800]   I'm just saying that this is the kind of interesting
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.400]   of a coincidence.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.920]   What was going on in the Bush White House
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.000]   was that you had Vice President Cheney saying,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.280]   "Bom, the suckers."
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.480]   He really wanted the military option against Iran.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.600]   And they said, "They're going nuclear.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.400]   We got a bomb."
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.360]   McCain was worse.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.720]   And apparently, McCain did too.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.320]   And a bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.040]   Exactly.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.520]   But apparently, Cooler heads prevailed and said,
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.760]   "Well, no, cyber warfare."
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.120]   Now, that was an aske of a rhetorical question.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.080]   The National Defense Authorization Act specifically says
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.920]   that cyber warfare is committed on the United States
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.640]   of America.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.720]   It's an act of war.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.120]   So how is this not an act of war?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.960]   And how come nobody's outraged about this?
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   It is an act of war.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.320]   In fact, the Chinese have been saying for years
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.880]   when accused of hacking US computers,
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.120]   you guys do it too.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.880]   And we said, "No, we do."
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.520]   Well, we do.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.680]   But he's not--
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.040]   And you know what happened with this attack?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.080]   Did you get to that part?
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.160]   They actually managed-- this virus actually managed to--
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.080]   It worked to destroy centrifuges.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.800]   Better than that.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   They were part-- there were parts everywhere.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.160]   Yeah, and the things that--
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.440]   They built themselves in pieces because they screwed them up.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.520]   It did the other part, which is--
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.080]   It's awesome.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.000]   --scared the Iranian scientists.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.520]   It was awesome.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.640]   So much, they couldn't figure out what was going on.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.600]   So they took working centrifuges out.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   They took them all out.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   It did exactly what it was supposed to do.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:12.760]   Right.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.760]   And they had to send people down into the centrifuge basement
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.600]   to watch them and have walkie talkies to talk to the people
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.080]   in the trailer because the control room software was saying,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.880]   oh, everything's fine.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.920]   Meanwhile, the centrifuges are flying into pieces.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.680]   Except for it.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   It escaped.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.200]   Come on, man.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.560]   Yes, and here's the problem.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.480]   Now, this seems to me--
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:28.960]   Except for--
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.400]   This is the--
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.320]   It got out.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.960]   And the Russians have already deconstructed the thing.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.640]   And it seems to me is that what they've done
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.000]   is they've introduced a toolkit because this product has
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   every sort of malware functionality.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.280]   Oh, now I should have a flamer.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.560]   Oh, yeah, I'm talking about flamer.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.400]   Well, get to flamer.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.160]   The flamer is what I keep thinking about.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.440]   So this was-- well, this was just like a test for flamer.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.360]   Yeah, no, flamer's worse.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.400]   So originally spread via Windows.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:53.680]   Why not?
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.320]   Got out.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:54.720]   Why not?
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.520]   They all get out.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:55.960]   Why not?
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.880]   And targeted Siemens industrial software
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.040]   and equipment, in particular, those centrifuges.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.720]   Our-- this scatter, which is--
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.320]   The scatter system.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.840]   These are the industrial systems that control our lights
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.480]   and--
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.560]   Supervisory control and data acquisition.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.480]   Very good.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.800]   I had-- I wanted to Wikipedia.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.240]   I didn't know what I'm doing.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.160]   I'm reading it right there.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:14.680]   Right there.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.320]   I did a show on it.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.680]   Anyway, the whole infrastructure
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.400]   is based, obviously, on computer controls.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.600]   The power systems, transportation, traffic lights.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.120]   Right.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.760]   Once the virus gets in there, it's--
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.920]   and no country is more dependent on computer control
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.280]   of infrastructure than ours.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.000]   I would think Japan, but apparently I'm wrong.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.440]   It's us.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.080]   So that's the other risk is the fun doing.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.680]   The fun is doing lights going on.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.320]   As soon as you open this door, we're
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.160]   the ones who could really be in trouble, especially
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.720]   once these viruses leak out.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.840]   Well, see, this is the problem I have with the Flamer,
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.640]   or Flame, which is the--
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.560]   it's a 20 megabyte file.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.720]   That's what's amazing.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.520]   Yeah, it is a monster.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.480]   It's a 20 megabyte.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.920]   Yeah, it was written by Microsoft.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.400]   No doubt about it.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.920]   I think it's more than 10-- as much as 10 years old, you know.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.680]   Yeah, but it's apparently an accumulation of all sorts.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.120]   10 years ago.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.280]   It couldn't transmit 20 meg.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.760]   It's got everything in it that you want.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.760]   It's gotten bigger.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.600]   Oh, right.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.120]   OK, yeah.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.000]   So whatever you want is in that code.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.280]   And so you can send it after anybody anywhere you want
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.480]   if you can get a hold of it.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.680]   And that one is targeted at--
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.480]   also Iran.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.360]   People.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.480]   And what it wakes up when they open their email
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.640]   and reads their emails and takes pictures from their camera
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.040]   and listens to their microphone.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.840]   In each module, there's different modules.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.760]   So there's the camera module.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.600]   Do you have to pay extra to get the camera module?
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.280]   It's like freemium.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.200]   Is it a free version of an upgrade?
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.520]   So Flamer's size involves the use of many third party code
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.880]   libraries, prefab modules.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.600]   By the way, nice feature Flamer when it installs--
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.080]   Flamer's.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.640]   --it installs SQ Lite.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.280]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.960]   So you have a nice database on there.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.720]   Because it needs somewhere to store all the passwords
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.880]   and stuff it's collecting.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.400]   It was written in C and C++.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.000]   And researchers are pretty convinced it also is governmental.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.560]   There's nobody.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.400]   No individual.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.040]   Well, as one of the people in the chat room
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.400]   says it works so well.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.120]   It can't be made by the government.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:56.760]   It relies on--
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.520]   If one of your right-winger--
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.720]   It uses Lua--
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.160]   Beatmaster.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.120]   --scripting language called Lua, which
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   is like--
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:04.720]   That's twice 20 megabytes.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.680]   Well, no, it has C++ code.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.520]   And then the Lua is the glue code that chooses which--
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.640]   It's very sophisticated, actually.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.960]   I wonder if there's a front end for it.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.320]   You know what would be cool is you write this thing so it needs
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.360]   a-- it has another module that doesn't--
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.680]   it's not included, but you plug it into this front end,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.880]   which allows you to program it to do different things.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.600]   Then you send it out into the wild,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.360]   where it latches onto some system
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.720]   and starts doing its thing.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.840]   That's how botnets work.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.560]   Well, that's-- well, I know.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.000]   But I'm talking about something that--
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.680]   Command and Control.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   --a botnet, it usually has a centralized location.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.840]   It tells these things what to do on the fly outside.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.360]   But I'm thinking of taking the actual code
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   and then customizing it with another piece of code.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.760]   Well, you're actually right, John,
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.840]   because that's one of the weaknesses of a virus,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.160]   is if you can look at the code and see
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.720]   where these servers are going to be,
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.280]   these Command and Control servers, you can shut them down.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.120]   In fact, exactly what Flamer did,
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.800]   it encrypted them and modified them,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.720]   it changed them based on date and time.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.440]   And it would-- the authors would
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.040]   know ahead of time what the server was going to be,
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.160]   but there was no way that you could look at the code
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.440]   and determine what the server was going to be.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.480]   So they infected exactly what you're thinking
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.080]   to obscure the source of the Command and Control botnets.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.200]   It's very clever.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.880]   Yeah, it's nasty work.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.520]   So I wonder what happened to the person who
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:19.080]   smuggled the Stuxnet into the Iranian facility.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.960]   Are they still alive?
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.720]   Did they get tortured?
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.280]   Did they get started?
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.440]   They didn't mention the wall and Langley or what, right?
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.200]   If they could find out who it was, if he was.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.840]   Are they a hero or a joke?
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.240]   It's an interesting--
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.440]   It depends if he's one of ours or one of theirs.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.120]   He's one of them, right?
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.400]   But he's working for--
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.880]   The Times said--
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.280]   The US and Israel.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:37.560]   Right.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.880]   The Times said the US and Israel relied on engineers,
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.680]   maintenance workers, and others, both spies
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.240]   and unwitting accomplices.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.640]   But you're right, somebody's got a hand.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.040]   I think--
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.240]   The infected US and Israel.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.560]   You could also--
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.640]   Do you get in your hands cut off or broken or something?
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.440]   I don't think I'm going to--
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.960]   No, no, you remember when the government is going to say,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.840]   oh, it could have been anybody.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.640]   They're going to go after people.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.520]   If they could figure it out.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.760]   You know your-- what's his name?
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.560]   The hacker that wrote the book that had social oriented--
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.080]   Midnik.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.580]   Midnik.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.340]   He made this interesting idea or mentioned
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.780]   an interesting idea.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.300]   Nobody has to be responsible.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.780]   You just leave a disc laying around that says payroll,
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.300]   totally, you know, everybody in the company-- payroll disc.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.140]   And then it's spreadsheet not to do confidential.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.780]   And people will plug it in.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.900]   That's probably all it took.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.660]   How much president--
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.940]   I can't make it.
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.740]   And it's right there, right on it.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.140]   And then--
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.260]   Yeah, once you put it in, you're screwed.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.740]   It's called a social engineering.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.260]   Social engineering, I'm just-- yeah.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.260]   Orhanik Kornikova photos that was--
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.260]   So is there-- is there--
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:39.060]   I mean, it seems as if we should be using every weapon we can,
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.060]   including cyber warfare, especially--
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.060]   this probably saved lives instead of bombing the plant.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.740]   Is there something immoral about this?
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.180]   Do you think, Doc?
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.100]   Well, it's-- you know, there's something
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.380]   hypocritical about it.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.780]   You know, this-- this do's comes out at a time
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.980]   when other countries in the world
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.940]   are wanting the ITU or the United Nations
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.940]   to take over for ICANN and--
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.340]   Yeah, that's the hardest one, isn't it?
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.780]   You know, it's sort of the-- it's happening at--
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.040]   and at the same time, I think maybe
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.100]   it was Rafe's saying it earlier.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.220]   There's a bit of hypocrisy involved here,
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.380]   because we're-- orhan-- John was saying that, you know,
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.460]   if we have a rule that says if you're
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.780]   doing a cyber attack on the US, it's an act of war.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.700]   Well, that was an act of war.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.700]   Obviously, it was an act of war.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.340]   Yes.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.500]   We-- you know, no act of congress.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.460]   No, it's saying that cyber terror or cyber warfare
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.860]   is an act of war is a gambit to convince--
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.260]   try to convince enemies that we're not going to do it
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.420]   when it's fact working on it.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:36.940]   Right.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.940]   Right, yeah.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.980]   It's a-- you know, it's a simple wartime operation.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.340]   It's all about deceit and misdirection.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.820]   No, we would never do this.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.380]   Right.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.580]   I'm really going to--
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.020]   We've had a policy for now with 11 years or 12 years
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:54.060]   or since 9/11 that we're at war with terrorism, which is--
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:54.860]   not a country.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.380]   It's not a anything.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.660]   It's just a behavior, which is an interesting thing too.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.060]   And there's no precedent for that as far as I know.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:02.900]   That's more of a--
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.260]   That's more of a--
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.740]   They shouldn't call that a war.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.020]   The war on the US is a police action, not a war.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.860]   The war on drugs is similar.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.180]   Yeah, that worked so well.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.220]   Yeah, no, it's a winner.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:12.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.300]   John Perry Barlow declared us losers in that this week,
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:15.780]   by the way.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.700]   Oh, it did eat.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.380]   He said we've lost the war on drugs now what?
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.140]   Pre-emptive cyber strikes against perceived national security
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:30.020]   threats are, according to Nick Harvey of Great Britain,
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:35.740]   he is somebody-- British Armed Forces Minister--
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.940]   civilized-- a civilized option to neutralize potential text.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.580]   I think it is more civilized to--
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.380]   well, OK, it's more civilized to break a centrifuge.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.140]   Now, it might not be so civilized to turn off power
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.420]   to a major city.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.060]   Exactly.
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:55.180]   Or is it civilized to do a die-hard on the air traffic
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.660]   control system?
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.660]   Right.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.340]   You're right.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.060]   So there are civilized and uncivilized cyber attacks.
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.020]   That's a dodge.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.820]   Going after the centrifuge big deal.
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.780]   Messy business.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.620]   And it is a messy business.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.220]   What remains disturbing?
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.900]   Said Armed Forces Minister.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.380]   What's his name?
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.380]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.100]   Now, this is a whole conversation going on.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.180]   Malaysian Defense Minister Ahmed Zahidah Hamidi said,
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.180]   "A cyber arms race is already underway.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.700]   He urged members of the Association of Southeast Asian
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.780]   nations to pool their resources to tackle
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.300]   increasingly complex cyber attacks.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.980]   What remains disturbing is that cyber warfare need not
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.020]   be waged by state-run organizations."
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.420]   Here's where terrorism comes in, but could be conducted
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.740]   by non-state entities or even individuals.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.740]   It's just another kind of weapon.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.940]   And like any weapon, it can be run--
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.940]   It's a weapon that you can't control.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.660]   And it's a weapon that 12-year-old in New Zealand can use.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.820]   You can't control terrorists.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.980]   I mean, they're using weapons that you can't control.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.980]   Just another weapon.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:04.460]   This flame, you've weaponized this tool, and it's out there.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.820]   And the more out there it is, the more people
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.500]   will be building defenses against it.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.540]   OK.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.860]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.540]   OK.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.220]   I'll quit then.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.220]   So we shouldn't wait.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:13.980]   We shouldn't worry.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.980]   We should stop while you're ahead.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.660]   But should we not be doing this?
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.700]   Yes, you're saying we should.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.380]   I'm saying that's a ridiculous argument.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.700]   It's inevitable as you build products
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.700]   that are technologically based.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.860]   You attack them with technology and to think
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.340]   that we shouldn't be doing it because it's wrong.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.860]   It's a war is wrong.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.820]   And this is a form of war.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.460]   Let's just stop while I'm OK.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.980]   Just to drive it in a complete absurdity,
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.900]   we agree through not using biological weapons.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.500]   We agree not to use poison gas.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.860]   So there are some weapons in war
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.380]   that we have kind of universally agreed.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.780]   They're so devastating, so horrible.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.980]   Like nuclear weapons.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.220]   Well, we do use nuclear weapons.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.660]   And we haven't agreed not to, although there
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.460]   is a nonproliferation pact.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.580]   But that's not exactly the same.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.260]   It's more like, we'll keep those.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.380]   You don't need those.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.140]   You do have a point.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:55.580]   You do have a point.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.140]   But there are weapons that are so horrendous.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.460]   There is a-- it's very difficult, I think,
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.300]   to draw the line between cyber and non-cyber.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.060]   Because war is increasingly technological.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.140]   The weapons are based on machines and technology
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.580]   and computational stuff.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.100]   So where do you say we're not going
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.580]   to attack those with the things that they're made out of?
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.100]   I don't know how you can possibly draw the line.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.860]   We had a visitor to the studio yesterday
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.340]   who's working on autonomous drones,
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.340]   not for a use overseas, but for use here in the United States.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.460]   Oh, we'll be droning each other shortly.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.700]   I can see Oakland getting a few Del Fire missiles.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.860]   And the drone continues more--
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.620]   All I have to say on drones, by the way,
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.220]   is let us replace traffic copters with unmanned four-pound
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.860]   drones we will save money in lives.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.580]   Should they have armaments of any kind of traffic?
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:44.980]   Yeah, oh, traffic copters, absolutely.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.580]   I think they should be armed to the-- yeah.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.460]   And also be bombs in case they--
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.580]   I think they should be--
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.180]   They're here to serve as traffic missiles.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.380]   It should be like in Spy Hunter.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.180]   They should be able to drop oil, thumbtacks.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.260]   Right.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.140]   I like the thumbtacks.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:00.780]   He's speeding.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.860]   Drop the thumbtacks.
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.500]   We're going to take a break and come back
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.620]   with more on this fabulous episode of this week.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.660]   In tech, I'm glad you're here.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.340]   Actually, before we go to the commercial,
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.700]   let's find out-- because I like to plan ahead.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.100]   What's going on in the weekend?
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.820]   We've got Tom Merritt just over there in our newsroom.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.860]   Ready to go, Tom?
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.380]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.380]   Here's a look at some of the things coming up in the week
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:19.900]   ahead.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.140]   Busy week for conferences.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.580]   Tuesday, June 5th, E3 kicks off down in LA.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.700]   That runs through June 7th.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.140]   Most of the press conferences are actually
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.980]   before the kickoff on Sunday and Monday.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.380]   Also, Computex kicks off and runs through the 9th in Taiwan.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.980]   Lots of hardware coming at that, including
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.540]   a bunch of tablets and laptops.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.100]   Airtime debuts on June 5th as well.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.140]   That's a new project from the Napster founders.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.980]   And the Samsung Galaxy Appeal Go Phone hits AT&T.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.900]   Wednesday, June 6th, Google plans
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.660]   to introduce the next dimension of maps.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.020]   So it might be a way to speak WWDC if Apple switches off
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.860]   Google Maps.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.140]   Also, Intel's first smartphone goes on sale in Europe
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.940]   on Wednesday.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.220]   And Wednesday, June 6th is World IPV 6 Day.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.740]   Finally, Friday, June 8th, the Southeast Linux Fest
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.220]   in Charlotte, North Carolina takes place.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.380]   Let's look with the week ahead.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.540]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.700]   You know, I'd like to say--
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.180]   Are you speaking of that?
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.500]   I could say-- I've decided to stop talking to Tom.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.180]   Why?
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:12.700]   Because--
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.060]   You're right over there.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.340]   No, I'm not going to say anything to him.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.020]   I've had it.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.860]   He likes you.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.660]   No, every time I try to have a conversation, he leaves.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.580]   He leaves, huh?
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.860]   I do want to talk a little bit about E3, what we can expect.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.340]   There, you were at all things D-race.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.860]   I'd like to find out more about what you got in the swag bag.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.580]   You know other than the panties?
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.380]   Well, he didn't talk about the panties on the show.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:32.900]   Oh, yes.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.300]   So we could bring that up.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.420]   I have a video of it somewhere.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.980]   Should we watch that video?
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.380]   Let's prepare a race swag bag video.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.340]   We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.300]   That's called a tease.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.700]   D10 swag bag video.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.980]   They actually-- were you a panelist
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.740]   or you just got it for showing up?
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.420]   Everybody gets us.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.260]   Like going to the D's?
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:51.540]   It's the Oscars.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.060]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:52.780]   Well, that's pretty cool.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.020]   What was the value?
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.100]   This year?
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.780]   Not so hot.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.660]   You know, you have to declare it on your taxes.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.100]   I had to declare the panties on my taxes.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:36:59.260]   Yes.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.100]   Absolutely.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:00.940]   And--
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.860]   That's going to cost me.
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.260]   The whole value of the bag.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.100]   That's exactly right.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.140]   It wasn't this year wasn't so--
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:05.820]   100 bucks?
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.500]   50 bucks?
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:06.700]   This year?
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.540]   $1,000?
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.060]   Doesn't the C&M have rules about that?
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.540]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.060]   Well--
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.500]   So you gave the swag bag back?
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.260]   Yeah, you gave it back.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:12.860]   And it's in the office.
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.300]   It's in the office.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.500]   I don't know what to do with it.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   I mean, I've got a drop cam.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.780]   That's the big deal.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:17.540]   A drop cam.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.040]   Huh?
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.540]   That's it.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:19.740]   That's it.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.780]   Uh-huh.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.220]   We're going to take a break and come back with more.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:29.940]   Mr. Needleman, we shall speak to you next about the swag.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.180]   But first a word from Gazelle.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.860]   Hey, if you've got some stuff in that swag bag,
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.140]   you'd like to sell it.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.260]   Gazelle it.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.460]   Whether you got an iPhone, an iPod, an iPad,
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:43.980]   a Samsung, a Galaxy 2S, S2, whatever it is.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.300]   If it's taken up space in your drawer--
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.500]   some people have gadget drawer.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.980]   You know, the old gadget's going to draw or closet.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.100]   There are people with storage lockers filled.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.340]   There are hoarders.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.380]   You know, that stuff's not getting more valuable.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.220]   In fact, I'm pretty much sure it's never
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.500]   going to gain value.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   Sell it now while you still can.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.900]   And Gazelle's the best way to do it.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.100]   Visit it right now, G-A-Z-E-W-L-E,
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:12.700]   just like the analog that runs across the African veld.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.100]   Gazelle.com.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.860]   If you click the dropdown, you'll see-- they've actually
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.620]   reduced the things that they buy because they found out
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.620]   most people just want to sell these iPhones, iPads, iPads,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.900]   Apple TVs, laptops, desktops, displays,
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.780]   bad Blackberries, HTC, Motorola, Samsung, LG, Android
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.220]   phones, or Nokia's.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.260]   Let's say, all right, let's talk--
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.860]   I got a second generation iPad I want to get an offer on.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.980]   So this is how easy it is.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.140]   That's one of the things I like about this now,
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.340]   is it's just you click a button.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.500]   Was it Verizon or ATT?
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.700]   It was AT&T.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.780]   I wonder if the price is different.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:46.340]   It's Verizon.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.860]   $335.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.580]   Now here's the deal.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.500]   They'll send you a check.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.620]   They'll pay value.
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.220]   But little pro tip here.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.180]   Amazon gift card gets an extra 5%.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.780]   So that would be my recommendation.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.780]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, don't sell it because--
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.620]   oh, they said don't say that.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.100]   Why not?
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:04.620]   I don't know.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.620]   I like it.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.620]   I made that up.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.740]   Gazelle your gadgets today and make a little money on the side.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.380]   Why pay rent?
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.020]   And by the way, they pay for the shipping.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.740]   And the quote is good for 30 days.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.140]   So you can just go and find out what it's worth.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.220]   You can decide.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.100]   You've got time.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.260]   It's hard, I know, to let go of those old iPads.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.620]   Oh, I have such memories.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.100]   Gazelle@gazelle.com.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:37.740]   John's-- OK, so you want to look at the swag?
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.340]   Do we have it on your computer?
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:45.700]   All right, John Slanina, which by the way means bacon and polish.
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.940]   John Slanina, is that Polish?
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.220]   Czech.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.740]   Is that a yes or is that Czech?
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.980]   Yes, Czechoslovakian.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   Czech.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.340]   OK.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.860]   Let's see the swag bag.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.060]   Or is it swag bag?
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.060]   It's swag.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.820]   Swag is not Yiddish.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.300]   It's stuff we all get.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.860]   Or souvenirs, wearables, and gifts.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.220]   Like shwag.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.140]   I don't think that's where it comes from, either way.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.420]   Do you think-- one of these things that sounds like Yiddish,
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.780]   but isn't-- it's not Yiddish.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:12.980]   No, it should be swag.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.060]   But it's actually swag.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.140]   You've got some swag stuff we all get.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.860]   So what'd you get?
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.580]   Where's this thing?
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:17.900]   I don't know.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.900]   It wasn't that great.
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.340]   Oh, here it is.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.100]   There's Rafe.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.100]   All right.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.020]   OK, we're in here.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.220]   He's just talking.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.860]   Hello, my dad is drinking bad eyes here.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.500]   And at a large, you see that?
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.860]   I just came back from the office.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.220]   I think it's decosuous amounts of swag.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.660]   Last year, there were two bags full, literally.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.540]   Two bags full?
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.620]   And it's down to one.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.100]   Yeah, it's not doing so well this year.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.060]   You have to snag.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.780]   That's a pretty good sized bag.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.460]   That's a lot.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.340]   It's mostly air.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.580]   Could be because of the economy.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.580]   Finally affecting the tech industry.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.660]   Am I going to MS-3K myself here?
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.180]   Yes.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.180]   That's what's going on here.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.340]   Just comment on your own video.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.260]   You're in here.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.180]   And you just put our profiles in front of you.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.020]   Get to the point.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.540]   Really, this guy in the video.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.060]   I was actually trying to provide context here about why
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.460]   this swag bag is so lame this year compared to last.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.660]   No bottle of wine.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.300]   Overheating little bit and--
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.380]   You think of human figures?
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.700]   Last year, we got to--
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.180]   I agree.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:12.660]   I agree.
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.580]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.100]   That's product.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.220]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.220]   I stood directly.
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.380]   I stood directly.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.860]   The director's cut.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.060]   Rave the little man.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.260]   The director's cut.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.780]   He went to D.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.020]   Has one.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.300]   So let's see what's in here for this year.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.660]   And hopefully it's still fair a little bit better.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.180]   Now there's less stuff in here than there
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.140]   has been in years past.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:33.700]   Yes, we know.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.220]   Thanks a lot.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.460]   Let's hope that the damn bag--
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.860]   You know, funny thing about doing this video is I actually
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.220]   didn't have a live audience heckling me when I was
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.660]   painting it in my hotel room.
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.180]   Hope is again, baby.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.660]   Oh, he's opened it, finally.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.820]   You get a lovely fleece paulover.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:51.580]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.500]   That's attractive.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.500]   It's just a plan.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.220]   That's good.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.220]   Cara Swisher would look great in that.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.180]   Doesn't say D on it.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.500]   Why does Ethan--
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.220]   Says Ethan.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.100]   Ethan's a guy I interviewed from--
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.860]   He stole his bag.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.260]   No, he was the guy from Yahoo.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:06.820]   What's his name?
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.740]   Why did his name pop up there?
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:09.860]   But there is, of course, a hoodie.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.580]   Got from Yahoo I interviewed.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   I see the effing you just keep pulling stuff out.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.780]   Ethan Batroski is the guy about a rat who
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.420]   acts as browser for some bizarre reason.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.820]   His name showed up on a swag bag video.
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:21.540]   That's odd.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.660]   That's very odd. I think this Kelly's fault back at the ranch.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.220]   Very nice cozy hoodie.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.860]   Hoodie, can't be a CEO if you're
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:28.900]   even going to have a hoodie anymore.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.660]   It's a target on it.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.020]   And if you don't know this logo, I probably should.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:33.860]   What is that logo?
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.580]   I have no idea what that logo is.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.020]   It's this branding for you.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.300]   Yeah, it's the target going online.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:41.780]   The D hat.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.900]   Oh, please, this is Warren.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.460]   Throw the crap.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.500]   There's fun stuffs at the end.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.980]   There's the panties.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.820]   All the way at the end.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.860]   And this is like a--
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.140]   Now he's embarrassed by it.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.020]   He introduced a video to us.
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.220]   I did not say, please play the video.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:53.860]   That was Leo.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.220]   He's sunglasses from Spotify.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.220]   So it's really--
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.780]   This is lame, lame, lame.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.780]   This is a chassis.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.060]   Paperwork and stuff.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.500]   You don't have to give any of this back.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.540]   This has no value.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.820]   No, it's a value of this.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.220]   A USB key from--
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.580]   With Stuxnet on it.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.180]   Very handy.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:12.780]   This idiot.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:13.980]   Give this to the idiots at the--
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.460]   Read Hoffman.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.060]   Read Hoffman.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.860]   Every time he speaks a D, he gets me in trouble,
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.700]   because they're like, you've got to cover Read Hoffman.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.300]   And I sit down.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:19.660]   I read it.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.940]   He's supposed to be very smart.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:21.940]   He's very smart.
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:22.620]   I found a real wink.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.580]   There's the perfect news that comes out in this--
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.740]   Tons of the book.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.740]   So I'm using that right now to run Windows 8
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.860]   unlike my Macska era right here.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.860]   There are a few parallels.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.980]   Three people on Windows machines and the rest on Macs.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:34.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.700]   That's just the way the world is going.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.820]   I'm sorry people in the chat room
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.540]   that this video was not made live for you.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.860]   There we are watching it, though.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.540]   How could I not a shadow of a robot?
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.180]   Oh, there we go.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.380]   That's very good.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.540]   I like fast.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:48.740]   Nice job.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.380]   Is that Docs?
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.420]   That's the square one is Doc.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.420]   I love that.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.420]   I love that.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.420]   I love that.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.420]   I love that.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.420]   I love that.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:56.420]   I love that.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.420]   I love that.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.420]   I love that.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.420]   I love it.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.420]   I love that.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.420]   I love that.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.420]   I love that.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.420]   I love it.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.420]   I love that.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.420]   I love it.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.420]   I love it.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.420]   I love it.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.420]   It's Maxtrobot.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.420]   He has from Ionian.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.420]   That's a skull candy.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.420]   How do they do that so fast?
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.420]   That's so awesome.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.420]   We had a line around.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.420]   That's the one thing I've got one.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.420]   Thank you, Maxtrobot.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.420]   Who's the one with the female profile there?
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.420]   That's Liz.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.420]   That's Liz Lemon.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.420]   I don't know what it is.
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.740]   A hundred bucks, a hundred fifty bucks.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.140]   And then in order to actually use it, you have to subscribe.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.100]   Which is another hundred bucks a year.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.260]   They have a free thing but that's why it's not your house.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.140]   Yeah, because it doesn't send you alerts or videos.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.340]   The moment you've all been waiting for.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.700]   This is pretty suspicious.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.700]   What could that be?
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.700]   It looks like June.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.700]   I'm having the past.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.500]   Do you not have to subscribe to the Drop Cam?
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.700]   I know that.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.100]   It's really much more useful if you do.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.100]   True and Company is an online bra retailer.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:55.220]   They have a new set of algorithms for helping women find the bras that fit them best without
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.100]   having to go through the measurement process.
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.100]   Really?
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.100]   You can just go to the website and find the right bra.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:03.260]   Yeah, if you tell them what bras that you wear, can she and wear and what dress size
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.260]   you normally wear?
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.260]   What is it?
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:09.820]   True, true bra, true and co.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.900]   Something to match the bra you're going to buy from True.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.420]   There we go.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.940]   It's a sappos for braziers.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.300]   I don't think this fits me.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.060]   Look, even in an article about that.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.060]   I know.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.060]   You should have thought about it.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.060]   You should have thought about it.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.060]   You should have thought about it.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.060]   I don't know what to do with them.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.580]   I'll find out what size they are later on.
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:27.580]   So there you go.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.580]   Purple, the purple would match my shirt.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.500]   You get it to come to the Decompers.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.100]   In addition, of course, to...
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.100]   Now Tim Boy!
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.100]   That was...
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.100]   That was creepy.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.100]   How was that 15 minutes?
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.100]   What was this?
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.100]   Oh, but I did say...
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.900]   I didn't see you recording any videos from the Decompers.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.900]   I'm just saying.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.820]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.820]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.820]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:54.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:45:59.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.780]   I'm just saying this a little bit about the Decompers.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:26.300]   Are your breasts equally round all over?
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.780]   I didn't even know that's called a balcony.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.780]   What's a balcony?
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.780]   What's a balcony?
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.780]   How would you even know about this site?
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:34.780]   I don't.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:35.780]   Great.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.780]   How would I know they pitched me?
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.780]   It was the only preview that I had time to take before the Decompers started.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.780]   It's just the...
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:45.780]   I got to say as much as I love the Decompers, the startups that were pitched there were
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.780]   mostly of this caliber as kind of like a kind of interesting from a business perspective.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:54.780]   I thought Tim Cook got a lot of ink and I thought he was interesting but he didn't say anything.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.780]   He was interesting but he didn't say anything.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.780]   He makes logical sense that sentence.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:46:59.780]   Well yeah, I'll give you an example.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.460]   Then you tell me if he said anything.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.540]   He says we're going to double down on secrecy.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.540]   What does that even mean?
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.620]   It means that they're going to even be more secret.
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.420]   The apples are even going to be more secret than they are before.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.060]   That's not saying anything but it's still interesting.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.540]   They will know what they're doing.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.540]   That's interesting.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.540]   They won't know what they're doing.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.060]   He said we're going to double down on secrecy except on things like openness when it comes
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:25.100]   to manufacturing and then the report comes out that their policies and stuff in China
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.820]   and Foxconn plants are actually not that good.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.260]   So they want to be more transparent and open.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.260]   That's what they're going to do.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.260]   Now you got it.
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.660]   We're going to double down on PR.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.980]   So see, we're translating now.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.180]   Cook was really interesting.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.780]   I mean the thing about the D conference, I wrote this and many other people who have
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.780]   written this as well.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:47.460]   There was one guy at D who was like over everything.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.820]   He impacted every single session.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:50.820]   Steve Jobs.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:51.820]   Totally Steve Jobs.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.140]   He was not this year but in past years.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.140]   No, this year.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.140]   This year.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.140]   This year.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.140]   It was jobs for a coach.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.140]   It was amazing.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.980]   It was cooks was the not jobs CEO.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.460]   There was the guy from Spotify talking about iTunes.
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:11.260]   There was Aria Manuel talking about movie industry with jobs impacted with Pixar.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:15.220]   There was Ed Catmull of Pixar and Disney talking about that.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.460]   Larry Ellison and Ed Catmull did a reminiscing what it was like to work with Steve Jobs.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.460]   This is more reflection.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.460]   This is more reflection.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:26.580]   That's more reflection of Walt Mossberg's sycophantic love for Apple than anything else.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.900]   That's not what the tech industry is.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.780]   I would not argue that.
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:35.220]   Well, Mossberg has written a lot of good stuff about jobs.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.100]   But yeah, about Apple.
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:41.620]   But I'm telling you, all the speakers there made references to him and one way or the other.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.220]   If I want to buy Walt Mossberg, I don't think he said you have to talk about jobs in order
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.220]   to come across things.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.100]   I'm suspicious of the whole thing.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.700]   By the way, here's some of the things Tim Cook told us.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.380]   He really loves being CEO at Apple.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.140]   He says, "It's an incredible time.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.140]   I'm loving it every minute."
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.140]   I'm sure he is.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:05.140]   He says, "I've never seen a product and technology that customers loved more than the iPad."
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.140]   Huh.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.140]   Really?
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.140]   He says, "I learned a lot from Steve."
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.140]   Oh.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.140]   Let me write that down.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:14.180]   He taught us all of life is fragile.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.460]   He's a visionary too.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.460]   And Apple.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.460]   Steve.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.700]   On Apple TV, now he said some interesting things.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.820]   He said, "For instance, the Apple TV is..."
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.380]   Now, please parse this because you were there.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.380]   You saw him.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.380]   You saw his expression.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.540]   Maybe you got some sense from what his face is saying, what he meant when he said the
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.820]   Apple TV is not a fifth leg of the stool.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.820]   What the hell?
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.620]   What kind of stool is this?
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.980]   I don't remember what gets a quote.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.980]   It's a really conservative stool.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.980]   Nothing but stool.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.580]   I believe in Apple TV is...
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:50.940]   I'm not sure, but I believe in Apple TV is kind of inevitable based on what he said and
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:55.740]   the way Ari Emmanuel, the super-agent Ari Emmanuel from Entourage.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.740]   Right.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.740]   Ari Gold.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.740]   Right.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.740]   Which, by the way, spot on.
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.740]   Really?
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.740]   Oh, totally.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.740]   That's great.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:03.740]   It's Ramamaniels' brother.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:05.740]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.740]   Totally.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:13.060]   When I think was Cara asked Ari, "So what do you think of the Apple TV?" and Ari says,
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.860]   "I haven't seen it."
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.860]   Don't know what you're talking about.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.300]   And it does a little smirk like that?
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.340]   Like I said, I can't smirk like that.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.340]   Interesting.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.340]   That man can't smirk.
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:25.340]   Interesting.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.340]   I don't...
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.340]   And I've been reading the transcripts.
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.900]   I didn't watch the video of Tim Cook, but somehow people got the sense that there was
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.300]   going to be not the Apple TV we know, but an Apple television set.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:39.700]   Well, Apple needs to move into new markets in order to become the trillion dollar company
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:40.700]   and everybody wants them to become.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.980]   They need to move into new markets and TV is it.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.220]   And apparently the set top box is even though Uber's simple set top box is like the Apple
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.540]   TV and the Roku, they're just not making an impact.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.020]   He sold 2.7 million of them.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.020]   I mean, nothing.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:53.020]   It's nothing.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.020]   It's not the hardware.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.620]   It's the deals they do for the content.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.420]   You don't have those deals yet.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.340]   Your app's the end is holding up everybody.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.340]   Who is?
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:05.340]   What Apple wants to do is blow up cable and they're too dependent on cable, but that's
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.340]   what you have to do.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:12.940]   If you're going to move TV past the log jam it's in now, you have to move off of the 500 channel
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:18.580]   world where there are all these bundles and it's an awful system into something that
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.580]   looks like the net.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.940]   And I think that's what Apple kind of wants to do while owning the show.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.820]   And they're only going to be able to do that by doing their deals.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:30.660]   And I don't know what that's going to be except it will probably involve Disney.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.100]   Doc's absolutely right.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:37.220]   And in the technology industry only Apple has the pull and the hotspot to pull off a
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:41.540]   move like that and to really up end the TV industry the way it did with music and the
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.380]   way it did with the telcos.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.540]   Only Apple can do that as far as I know.
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.540]   Exactly.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.340]   It used to be Sony but not anymore.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:49.340]   Sorry.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.900]   Steve is the only guy who proved he could do that over and over again.
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.540]   I'm not sure that Tim Cook has that leverage.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.540]   That's the question.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.980]   So is this a more lock in though, Doc?
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.540]   I mean you were just saying how companies shouldn't be sure.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.820]   I mean that's what they're doing, right?
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.820]   They want to own it all.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:06.820]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.900]   We're going to have stuff that's free and stuff that's paid.
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:10.900]   And that's it.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.100]   And it's going to be either subscription or a la carte.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.540]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.220]   They're going to make it as easy as they possibly can and they're going to do their
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:19.540]   deals but you're going to pay for it.
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.660]   Whatever it is you're going to pay.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:21.660]   Right now it's too much.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.660]   I mean people don't want to pay.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:23.660]   Why shouldn't we pay for content?
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:24.660]   It costs money to make it.
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:27.860]   No, I don't think most people have a problem with doing that.
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.020]   Apple proved that with iTunes 10 years ago.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.140]   The question is how can they make that work with video content?
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:36.140]   How can they do that?
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.660]   And probably what they do is they're looking at YouTube and saying, well that's all the
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.820]   free stuff and we're going to have the good stuff and you can get the free crap on YouTube
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.100]   and you get the good stuff on our thing and it's not just going to be TV.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:52.220]   I wouldn't be surprised if they make a screen that exceeds the dimensions of 1080p because
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.580]   that's what the iPad is.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:54.580]   That's interesting.
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.460]   You mean a 4K screen for instance?
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.460]   Exactly.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.460]   I think that's where they're going.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.460]   I think that's where they're going to go.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:06.700]   And they're looking at 1080p as a 1996 standard and they're tired of it and they want to break
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:07.700]   out of it.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.700]   And it won't be 4K.
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.700]   It won't be 4K.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.700]   It'll be some non-standard Apple thing.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.700]   You're right.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:13.700]   It'll be 2.8K.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.540]   They're saying and they're going to work with, you know, they'll be the thing is that most
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.500]   movies right now are being shot in 1080p.
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.220]   So whether or not, you know, they're going to drive Hollywood into higher...
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.220]   I think not actually.
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.020]   I think Hollywood is doing more and more 4K and that's certainly...
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.020]   Oh, there you go.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.340]   Yeah, that's James Cameron's pushing that very heavily.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:33.940]   He's also pushing 60 FPS faster frame rates at a higher resolution.
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.140]   Because we want the world to look like a soap opera.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:40.340]   Well, that's no because you're thinking it's going to look like the interpolated LCDs.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.340]   It doesn't.
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.300]   It looks more realistic without interpolation.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:48.140]   The faster frame rate and the higher resolution makes it just look like you're right here.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.140]   It's very vivid.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.700]   Now, and by the way, you don't need 3D in my opinion.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:55.380]   How about spending money for writers and good content out of this whole crap?
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:59.100]   We just got a blow more crap up and make it 3D.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.420]   That's all you have to do.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.420]   Writing is hard.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:04.220]   Explosions are easy.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.260]   Expensive though.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.900]   The challenge with going to 4K and 60 frames per second or whatever is that that's going
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.060]   to just...
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.340]   We don't have the bandwidth for that.
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.660]   I do like this idea that Apple...
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:17.820]   Because if Apple's going to do a television set, it's got to do something different.
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.820]   I mean, there's...
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.700]   It's a commodity at this point, right?
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.180]   Samsung, LG, Sharp, Sony...
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:24.180]   What's the difference?
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.020]   They're minor, minor differences.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.100]   These are commoditized products at this point.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.740]   So Apple doesn't want to join that parade.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.820]   But what do they do that makes it unique?
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:32.980]   Is it user interface?
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.020]   Is it higher resolution?
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.020]   It's both.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.020]   It's content deals?
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.020]   It's the deals.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:44.260]   Plugging the TV, turn off your $100, $120 a month cable subscription, just plugging into
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:45.260]   the internet somehow.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.500]   Well, that'll make people happy.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.820]   That's not going to work.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:51.580]   How do you make a product that kills Comcast, cable vision?
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:56.220]   Well, Apple is managing to kill everything that the mobile carriers do.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:00.460]   I mean, they've taken over just like BlackBerry did, except in a bigger scale.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.980]   They're taking over SMS.
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:06.500]   Eventually with Skype, et cetera, we'll take over the calling, which is why you buy a
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.500]   phone.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.700]   Okay, so anyway, related story...
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.420]   Imagine if Apple had bought Skype.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.980]   Just interesting thought.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:16.140]   Would it have been any different?
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.420]   I mean, Microsoft hasn't done anything with Skype.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.980]   Apple has FaceTime, which is exactly taken over the world.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.980]   I don't think they're degrading.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.980]   We use...
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.980]   Look how good Doc looks.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.980]   Yeah, it looks okay.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:26.980]   I think Skype's got...
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.980]   We're not degrading Doc.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:28.980]   The codec is great.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.620]   It's just the UI still sucks.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:31.620]   Yes.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.580]   Well, there was a bit of D about how...
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:39.860]   I think it was Topolsky, who lambasted the guy from Skype about how crappy the Mac UI
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:40.860]   is.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:41.860]   Yeah, well, brightly so.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:42.860]   Yeah, really.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.860]   It's fact...
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.660]   We actually were telling our...
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.380]   We used Skype for all of our remote guests.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.380]   We were telling people, "Do not."
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.500]   Whatever you do, upgrade to Skype 5 on your Mac.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.740]   That'd be a big mistake doing that.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:52.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.900]   Now, here's the thing about Skype.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.860]   Microsoft owns Skype and Microsoft also has a giant investment in Facebook.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:58.860]   That's the real connection.
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:55:59.860]   Skype plus Facebook.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:00.860]   I agree.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:08.340]   The same reason Microsoft bought patents was to defend Facebook against the Yahoo on slot.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.780]   There's the Microsoft Facebook Nexus.
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.780]   It's very interesting.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:11.780]   You're better for it.
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.300]   Yeah, Tim Cook said, "Stay tuned."
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.300]   Right?
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.300]   So everybody's expecting that iOS...
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:18.100]   He's on me.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.100]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:20.100]   "Stay tuned!"
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:23.100]   When they said, "What about Facebook integration in iOS?
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.100]   You've got Twitter.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.100]   What about Facebook?
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.100]   Do you guys hate Facebook?"
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.380]   He said, "No, I saw Cheryl Sandberg in the hall.
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:29.460]   We were great friends.
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.460]   We have different...
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.860]   You know, our companies are going in different directions, but stay tuned!"
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:39.060]   People make a big deal about the fact that iOS 5.1 or 5, whatever, is all integrated
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.300]   in with Twitter and not Facebook.
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.900]   But Facebook is still embedded in a lot of Mac apps, a lot of OS 10 apps.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.900]   I mean, I spoke to...
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.540]   Facebook Connect is huge.
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:49.380]   But Facebook is built into Mac apps.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.380]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   Applezone apps.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.380]   Yeah, Applezone.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.380]   So it'll come to...
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.820]   I believe iOS 6 will have a lot of Facebook integration.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.940]   Facebook and Twitter are different.
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.860]   Totally different things.
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:03.220]   But Microsoft plus Facebook is like double the lack of originality.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.780]   You know, I mean, you get two for one.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.780]   You know, I...
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:11.300]   Well, I'm sure Microsoft's hoping that some of the Facebook charm will rub off on them.
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.300]   And Facebook's hoping that Microsoft will provide...
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.300]   Hopefully not for stock price.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.300]   God.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.300]   Really so...
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:20.260]   Doc, you understand you're swimming upstream when you say that.
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.660]   800 million, 900 million people use Facebook now.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.660]   Use it regularly.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.420]   Actually, the last time I was on Twitter was when you got off Facebook.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.220]   And you know why I'm back on.
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.220]   I did.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:32.220]   And you know why?
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.900]   Because you can't cover the industry and not be using Facebook, right?
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:35.900]   Oh, bull.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.660]   I don't use Facebook.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:39.100]   I cover the industry.
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.260]   Some would say you might be a little out of touch, John.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.020]   Well, they've been saying that for 20 years.
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:47.300]   I felt that I needed to know when Facebook announced these products, I needed to look
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.300]   at them.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.300]   No!
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.060]   I'm not like you.
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.940]   I can't grok something from a distance.
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:56.140]   I have to participate to understand it.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:59.260]   I just listen to what you have to say and I just copy what you say.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.100]   So I'm glad somebody's doing the basic footwork.
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.100]   Somebody's got to do footwork.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.100]   It's not me.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.500]   Hey, I am sacrificing myself.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.700]   I am well aware of that by using Facebook.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.700]   You use Facebook.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:10.700]   Ralph, I know we're buddies.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.700]   We're Facebook.
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.100]   I know exactly what's going on in your life.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.460]   You know exactly what I want you to know about what's going on in my life.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.500]   Lies on Facebook.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.380]   Facebook is individual people's PR arms.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.820]   Anyway, you're right, Doc.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.420]   I did get off Facebook.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:30.340]   I felt Facebook was, and even more so after the start to learn about the shady stock
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:35.420]   stuff that was never been as been the nicest people in the world.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.460]   And yet I kind of say as a user, I kind of like it.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.940]   It kind of sucks you in.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.180]   Is it not addictive?
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:46.460]   You always go to your timeline and look at pictures of yourself.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:49.660]   This is not research for being an industry pundit.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.660]   This is me and my people.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:52.660]   What are your ads?
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.660]   Let me see what your ads are.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.060]   Oh, the ads will tell you everything.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.060]   OK, let's see.
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.660]   20 dollars and under Ford Flair.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.660]   Just what I want.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:00.660]   Ford cufflinks.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.660]   Ford cufflinks.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:03.060]   Three wear men's shoes.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:04.780]   There's one with a woman loafers.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:09.220]   There's one, and I haven't seen it in a while, but there was one that was really, I don't
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.580]   see it now.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.620]   I often get busty women for some reason.
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.820]   There's one for the D-Pantee is the surplus D-Pantee.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.980]   The D-Pantee is the surplus D-Pantee.
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:17.980]   You know what?
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:21.860]   If I sign up for that, if I do order a bra, you know I'll be getting stuff on Facebook
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.860]   about it.
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:23.860]   You don't even have to.
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:24.940]   I'll confuse the hell out of them.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:25.940]   That's worth doing just for that.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:29.740]   You've already gone to that true site, and they probably know if you use Facebook Connect
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:30.740]   to get in there.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:31.740]   Yep.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.060]   And they're going to think that you want that, and that's what you're about.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.540]   And you'll get ads for that.
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:39.020]   There is a very large women's shoes.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:43.540]   There is increasingly the sense that maybe ad tracking doesn't work.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.340]   Maybe customized ads don't work.
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.300]   They don't work on Facebook.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.580]   Well GM said they didn't work.
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.380]   I think that's more because GM couldn't figure anything.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:54.140]   And then GM, then the next day also pulled out of the Super Bowl.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.660]   I mean, so they were just, I think it was all covered because they were out of ad money.
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.940]   You know, somebody told me that what GM wanted to do was a takeover.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:05.860]   And Facebook said, "You can't do a takeover on, a takeover is in the banner ad business
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.140]   where you take over a whole page."
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.420]   It's like GM, GM, GM, all over the page.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.420]   And Facebook wouldn't do that.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.740]   And GM said, "Well then, we don't know how to use Facebook.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   If you won't let us do that."
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.700]   But they still maintain their free presence funny.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:19.700]   I mean they still have a Facebook.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.620]   Well I think that's the message that some were taking from this is Facebook works, but
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.620]   why pay?
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.620]   I don't know.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.940]   I mean, just have a page, but I don't know.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.460]   Doc, that's not real engagement.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.300]   And that's kind of what you're saying, isn't it?
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.180]   Well, and I was saying several things.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:34.980]   One is that I, you know, obviously they're just successfully doing what they're doing
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:35.980]   in Facebook.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   Facebook is, yes.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.420]   Well I mean in terms of the social side of it, they're, I mean that works to the degree
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.540]   that a zillion people are involved in it.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.620]   But the advertising is actually remarkably bad.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.620]   It's remarkably off.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:46.620]   It is.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.820]   With their algorithm supposedly knows about you, it's remarkably off.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.620]   Most of it's really way off.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.620]   And it's surprising.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:58.540]   Now I've talked to a number of people who have advertised on there and who have said to almost
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:01.380]   a person that it doesn't work very well if at all.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.980]   However, I spoke to somebody today who absolutely swears by it.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:04.980]   So I don't know.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.740]   I mean I guess in some cases it does, if it's really narrow, if you're already, if you're
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:13.220]   already loved to some degree and you're just trying to enlarge the love that they have for
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.900]   you, in this case it was a radio station here in Boston.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:26.340]   But you know, the NPR podcast, Planet Money, had a really good thing on a pizza place in
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:30.060]   New Orleans where they did everything by the book and they're already loved by zillion
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.100]   people and they got like not one response, not one.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.100]   They paid nothing.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.300]   Can I have a little rant about Facebook ads here?
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.300]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   The reason Facebook has two problems with ads.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:44.980]   First, on the main site, you don't go to Facebook because you're looking to do research.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:48.900]   You go to Facebook to keep up with your friends and that's why ads don't work because I don't
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:55.380]   care how much it, how many ads I get for Bonnebout's pants, which is all the time.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.380]   I'm not in the mood.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.380]   By clothes.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.380]   Some pants.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.380]   Pants, bottomless pants.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380]   Bonnebout's.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.380]   Oh, look what I get.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380]   Okay.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.380]   Anyway, let me go on.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.380]   I got a really confused.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:10.780]   They think I want to race in a 13 mile race with a muddy woman who looks somewhat like
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.420]   I got to say Raquel Welch.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.580]   You like muddy women?
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.820]   And then boyfriend wanted seniors meet.com.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.820]   Oh, good.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.540]   Your girlfriend wanted senior people meet.com.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:24.540]   So not only am I old, but apparently I want a boyfriend and a girlfriend and I want to
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.780]   meet older women and I want to learn Python.
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.780]   Monazia, Twa with Python.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.620]   There you go with a snake.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.620]   Wow.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.220]   I think you're absolutely nailed you.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.420]   As I was saying, so that is problem one.
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:36.580]   Problem two is they don't make it.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:39.660]   It doesn't work on mobile because there's no bandwidth in real estate and everybody knows
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.340]   that that's why one of the reasons their stock is doing so badly.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:47.500]   But where Facebook can win is if they go from advertising on Facebook to advertisements
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:51.940]   elsewhere and compete with Google directly for advertisements on the internet.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.940]   To be like AdSense.
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.940]   Do an ad network.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940]   Well, that's their future.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.740]   That's where Facebook has to go.
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.620]   That's where the social network, that's where the social proximity will actually work.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:05.740]   In the last couple of shows, Scoble was on here and he predicted because he'd seen the
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:06.740]   deck I suppose.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.740]   So magical.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.940]   That was all mobile.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.140]   That was the future of Facebook.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:13.140]   But then figured out how to do it.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.940]   Neither was Google.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:23.820]   I'm willing to stipulate that perhaps Mark Zuckerberg has some deep plan for monetization.
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.300]   But I think it's also possible that you're right that he has no idea what he's doing.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.300]   Oh, no.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:29.940]   That's why he keeps buying mobile companies.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.140]   That's why he bought Instagram.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.140]   No, I haven't.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.140]   You've considered that possibility.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:37.540]   The Instagram is crazy because Facebook then three weeks later releases a Facebook camera
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.540]   after you're right.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.540]   That was pretty.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.540]   That was pretty freaky weird.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.540]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.740]   And you just bought a company for a billion dollars and you were working on a similar
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.060]   product with filters and everything all along.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.220]   What did you get?
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.060]   This is why they are AOL 2.0.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.660]   Remember all of the instant messaging companies that AOL bought?
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.660]   It's the same thing.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.660]   They're just the same.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.660]   They're lost.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.660]   They're wandering in the desert lost without any plan.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:07.740]   I've also heard that Cheryl runs the business side and Zuck runs the tech side and that for
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:13.820]   the most part, unless he wants to suddenly in a fit of large S by a company, he does not
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.420]   involved in the business side of the thing.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.420]   I don't know if that's true.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.340]   In other words, he's not working on monetization.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.340]   It's not large S.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.260]   He's buying mobile companies because Facebook desperately needs mobile talent.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.260]   Right.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.260]   He's buying for the people.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.700]   Although a billion dollars for Instagram makes no sense about that metric.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.700]   They got 10 people.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.700]   Right.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.700]   For a hundred million each.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.700]   12.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.700]   Okay.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:39.380]   By the way, Ford has 1.5 million likes on here.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:42.580]   General Motors, $34,340,000.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.020]   What does a like get you?
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.020]   Nothing.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.020]   Nothing.
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.020]   I don't think it's the thing.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.020]   You have a bot that creates this.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.020]   I get all these likes.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.020]   I'll tell you the one thing.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.300]   I don't know how valuable it is, but the one thing it gets you is that in fact you'll
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.820]   see this right here.
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.700]   It says somewhere it says Robert.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.900]   Robert, see, okay, one of the people I follow.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.900]   Robert's who likes everything.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.900]   It's a good thing.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.300]   Jesse stay likes fab.com.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:10.500]   So in this ad, I'm getting there's a little plug from one of my friends.
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.500]   Right.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.500]   So that's one of the things they get, I guess.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.860]   That's one of those ineffective ads that you're never going to know.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:18.820]   I never, I wouldn't have ever seen that if I hadn't actually been looking at it.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.820]   So state farm.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:20.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:21.820]   State farm.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.820]   You can't find enough ways to sell out.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:26.460]   So it's a safe farm apparently wants me to take a job as an insurance agent with them.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:32.620]   Well, just in case a good night of day and achieve unlimited income unlimited.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:35.340]   So that is a lie.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:44.020]   My income, if I were selling insurance would be unlimited or this week, Zazzle bag feed
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.020]   is up.
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:49.020]   I don't even know what that is.
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.020]   Spell that.
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.020]   What is it?
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.020]   I don't know.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.020]   It's something apparently there's it sounds like a disease.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.300]   It sounds there's an ad somebody bought this.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.220]   I don't know why Zazzle bag feed is up.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.220]   Zazzle bag.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:05.740]   Get the word go forth from this country to all the Zazzle bag.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.620]   Fade is up.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:12.940]   Municipal bond suites, $20 and under Ford cufflinks.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.940]   You're right.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.940]   You're right, Doc.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.940]   This is junk.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:16.940]   It's a junk.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.020]   Absolute junk advertising.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.020]   Wow.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.700]   Well, there you go.
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.940]   Here's some interesting news.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:30.340]   No, Verizon has announced that they are going to now offer 300 megabit down, 65 megabit
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.300]   up service.
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.940]   They didn't announce pricing, but it's leaked out that it will be if you sign up for two
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.860]   years, $205 a month.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.660]   For how many giga megabits?
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.660]   300 down, 65 up.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:45.660]   That's a lot.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.940]   You can't do anything because no servers that fast.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:55.060]   If you have a family of 16 tablets and they're all downloading different movies at the same
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.060]   time.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.940]   Oh, you own a condo or apartment building.
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.460]   This is Verizon Firehouse, the Mormon Polygamy edition.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.460]   You've been working on that gig?
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.380]   No, I just came up with that like that.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.380]   It came out of my brain.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.300]   It seemed to have hurt.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.220]   The prices I think on 15 gigs were--
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.220]   That's because I was so Pat.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.220]   It was too good.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.220]   I should perhaps make it.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.220]   I should have fumfered around a little bit.
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:16.220]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.620]   John and I are having a thing.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.620]   Just ignore it.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.540]   I'm just 25 megabits symmetrical here.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.540]   It's nice.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.220]   I have to say that their service has been outstanding.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.060]   And what do you pay for that?
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.380]   That's 75 bucks a month?
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.780]   Is that what that is?
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.940]   I'm paying 70 a month for 25 symmetrical, but I have no TV.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.380]   There's no bundle.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:41.700]   So we got rid of the TV part, which had an awful UI and we never watched.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.180]   But this is really solid.
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.780]   Is Verizon, you say, or--
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780]   Yes.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.780]   This is Verizon Firehouse.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.780]   He's got a firehouse.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.780]   Wow.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.780]   Look how good that looks.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.780]   No, that's why it looks so good.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.500]   Look how good that looks.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.500]   Works great.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.500]   I guess you've had one of the best you've had on the show for the last year.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.700]   And it's pretty consistent, right?
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:58.700]   Yeah, it's solid.
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.700]   It's solid.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.380]   And of course, they've stopped developing it, you see, because they did a deal with
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:10.060]   Comcast that the feds aren't investigating where they're-- no commercial company is developing
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.060]   fiber right now.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.060]   Isn't that ironic?
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:13.540]   So in fact, John, you said this.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.580]   You said Firehouse was just going to be a show piece that they wouldn't roll it out.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.580]   They surprised us all.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.100]   They rolled it out much more wildly.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.580]   But now they've said, we're not going to do any more files than sell somebody.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:23.820]   It's like a club.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.300]   You can't go in until somebody goes out.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.140]   To form a corruption.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.140]   And that was a deal.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.140]   You're saying--
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.140]   Totally.
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.140]   --talk it was a deal with Comcast?
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.140]   Well, they're not calling it that, but it was very coincidental.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.180]   And I'm not remembering exactly the thing.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:38.300]   But they want-- it's a combination of they want spectrum for wireless, because that's
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.460]   where they're making a big money right now.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.460]   Right.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:45.380]   And I guess Comcast was sitting on a spectrum or somebody was sitting on a spectrum.
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:50.780]   And they announced that they were not going to continue developing, rolling out files
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.980]   at the same time as they went for this deal with the cable guys.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:09:00.100]   So just watch, follow the money, as the movie said.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.100]   Right.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.980]   And it's all this backroom dealing.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.180]   They're all in this thing that Bob Frank's thing called the regulatory.
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.180]   Right.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.820]   They talk about the free market at work.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.980]   They never met a free market.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:13.380]   They own the market.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:17.380]   There's zoo animals in a regulatory zoo that they run.
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.380]   Right.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.460]   So in the meantime, they're at almost every state.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.780]   They're lobbying hard to prevent the mutis, municipalities--
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:26.780]   Sure.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:30.140]   --from doing any kind of a build out.
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:34.220]   So as a result, nobody's doing anything other than the carriers, and the carriers aren't
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.220]   doing it.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.580]   So we're falling farther and farther behind the rest of the world.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.820]   And that's the free market at work.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:45.500]   And ironically now, these guys are so dependent on this culture of monopoly that they have
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.020]   to be protected.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.780]   We can't allow competition.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.980]   They go out of business.
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.460]   This is not the free market at work.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.740]   This is a corrupt system.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.740]   It's not the free market.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.020]   If it's the free market, we have some choices here.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.100]   Well, it's interesting.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:03.540]   What we're seeing-- and I hope people remember this-- is the exact result of an experiment
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:08.540]   that was performed on us, the people about 20 years ago, where our government decided,
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:12.420]   no, we need to protect these incumbents so that they will build out.
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:16.820]   And the premise was we will get faster, better internet, because we're going to protect the
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.820]   incumbents.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:20.860]   We're going to give them a chance to make the money back for laying all that copper,
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.380]   a lay and all that fiber.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:26.580]   And in Europe, in Scandinavia and other countries, they didn't do that.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.820]   And who's got the better internet connection now?
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.740]   We now know the result.
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.100]   Our market works.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:36.140]   Yeah, but that doesn't work here because we don't have it.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:37.700]   We didn't have it.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.700]   We're in the late--
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:44.420]   You can't, but how do you build a government-run internet infrastructure in this country?
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.780]   Well, it's too late now, but it's always been too late.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.300]   It's politically impossible here.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.300]   We don't do that.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:55.420]   And in the rest of the world, there's an understanding that there's a symbiosis between government
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.500]   and business.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.500]   And here, there's not.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:58.900]   It's government versus business.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:03.980]   And so you get the big policy people on the left and you get the big business people
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:08.020]   on the right, and neither one of them really want the marketplace to work.
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.500]   One doesn't get the marketplace.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.740]   The other gets how big business can run the marketplace.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.740]   And that's our choice.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.740]   It's really creepy and bad.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:17.980]   Well, and we get the internet we deserve.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.500]   It's better than no internet.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.500]   It is.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.500]   It's debatable.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.260]   I had a guy call me on the radio show who said, "I turned off my internet.
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.260]   Can I still get hacked?"
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.980]   I said, "No, you're safe.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.980]   Congratulations."
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:30.980]   He could get stuck-snick.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.300]   You could from a thumb drive.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.780]   He said, "Are they watching me?"
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.780]   Who's they?
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:37.780]   I don't know.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.180]   I said, "I don't think they're watching you anymore."
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.180]   Don't care.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.540]   Then I told him, "Well, I'm going to read."
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.540]   Tell him to do what I do.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:47.220]   Put a little piece of gaffers tape over the camera on your laptop.
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.020]   I ended up deciding to scare the-
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:52.620]   I have a little green page flag and I just-
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:53.620]   You actually do that.
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:54.620]   Look at that.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620]   No, not doing twit.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.620]   There it is.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:57.620]   We can't-
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.620]   Let's tell him we can still see him.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.620]   Just to freak him out.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.460]   You know, by the way, we can absolutely see what you're doing.
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.620]   In fact, that green thing is reflecting your screen.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.620]   No, actually what it does is it looks like you have no clothes on.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.620]   It's an amazing product.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.100]   Just wishful thinking of your part.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.100]   Oh.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.820]   I think I scared the guy.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.300]   I told him about Vanek freaking.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.100]   I said, "Well, you want to keep your monitor away from the wall because if there's something
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.980]   on the other side of the wall, it's very easy for him to pick up what you're doing."
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.980]   You said that?
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.980]   Unbelievable.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.340]   Messing with the norms.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   That's my idea.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.340]   The norms.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.340]   The norms.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.540]   The normies.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:37.060]   It is true.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.220]   I'm not kidding.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.180]   So let's talk about stamps.com and then we'll continue on.
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.820]   We have a vast in studio audience.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:45.140]   I can't see this, but there are like 15, 20, 30-
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.660]   It's a good crowd here.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.060]   There's actually women in the audience, which rarely happens.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.180]   Yeah, we got one, two, three, four.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.180]   Wow.
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.180]   What happened?
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.180]   Is this Mother's Day?
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.500]   Yeah, they're all waving.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.500]   All four of them.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:58.500]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.820]   So women, would you please wave?
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.620]   All right, thank you very much.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.420]   And after the show, you can come up and get the panties from a rave.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:05.420]   I should have brought them with.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.420]   You should auction them off.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:07.420]   I should have.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.580]   We should get that drone camera.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.940]   I think they were sized for the D attendees, which are all guys.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.940]   I don't think they'd fit any of the women who were here.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:16.420]   Size D panties.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:17.420]   I think we have a show.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   D, it was yes.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.420]   It was a D conference.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.700]   Let's talk about stamps.com.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:25.140]   They've had the lower third up and the guys at stamps.com are saying, "Take it down!
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.140]   Take it down!"
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.140]   "Take it down!
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:29.140]   He's talking about panties!"
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:34.740]   Ladies and gentlemen, when's the last time you went to the post office, John?
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.740]   A couple of days ago.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.740]   Yes, fun, isn't it?
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.140]   Well, I had one of those big giant boxes.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.140]   Right.
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.140]   And they won't let you put that in the mail.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.140]   Your mail carrier won't take it.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.140]   You can't put it in the mailbox.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.060]   Because it's too big.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.580]   Did you know that if you had used stamps.com, they would take it.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:48.580]   They would come and they would get it.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.580]   You could actually schedule a pickup free from the postal service.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:52.580]   Did you know that?
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:53.580]   Count me in.
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.180]   I think you should.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.180]   This is an amazing thing.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.340]   You don't have to go to the post office anymore.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.340]   Print your own postage.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.660]   You can print it right on the envelope, which looks really good with your logo and everything.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.300]   You can also mail packages.
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.300]   The rule...
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:08.300]   What?
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.860]   What is this welcome Leo Laporte list on their home page?
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.460]   Well, that's because I don't know.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.060]   Somehow it thinks that I'm Leo Laporte.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.740]   But let me, if I can go to the front page...
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:19.540]   See, every time it does this, this is not what you will get if you go to stamps.com.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.780]   You'll have to do some special things to get that.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.100]   Let me tell you about that.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.100]   You're going to see there's a microphone on the right.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:29.500]   You click that and you enter in the offer code TWIT.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.780]   What happens magically?
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.100]   That special offer on the front page is $80.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.660]   It goes to $110 because we give you more postage coupons.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.660]   $55 a free postage coupons.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:43.420]   We give you a free digital scale with $50 you just pay shipping and handling.
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.340]   You get a supply kit, you get a four week trial.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.900]   The scale is cool because it plugs it in to your computer and then you throw the thing
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.700]   on there and the software does it all.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:56.100]   In fact, this is really our typing elimination program because if you use eBay or Amazon as
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:59.700]   a seller, it'll just fill out the forms for you and print it all.
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:04.220]   If you do international mail, same thing, you don't have to type in anything.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:07.820]   If you use QuickBooks, it'll take your address book from QuickBooks and you do invoices.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.780]   We use it.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.980]   We actually end up buying two scales because we were fighting over it.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:16.820]   Stamps.com is a great deal and this special offer is available right now.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.220]   If you go to stamps.com, don't look at me like that.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.220]   What do you ship?
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.220]   What do you ship?
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220]   Stuff.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:24.220]   Okay.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.220]   Things and stuff.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.220]   Stuff.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.220]   What do we ship, John?
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:29.220]   We ship stuff back and we ship back.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.220]   We ship back.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.940]   We ship stuff.
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.060]   People buy stuff from us.
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:35.460]   We get a little factory in the basement.
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:36.900]   We do a little piece work stuff.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.580]   We do things.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.940]   Fan mail.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:41.940]   We send stuff out.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.100]   We do.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:47.020]   Actually, we ship back everything that we get for review for before you buy.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.020]   We have to ship back.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.020]   We ship stuff.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.020]   We do.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.540]   I hadn't really thought about the panty thing yet.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:55.540]   That's an interesting sign.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.540]   You could make some money.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:57.540]   It's a sideline.
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.260]   You know, is it the word panty?
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:00.260]   Twit panties.
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.140]   That makes it so compelling.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.140]   Just panty.
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:06.140]   If we call it pants, like underpants, that wouldn't be so interesting.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.020]   I think they should have their own name.
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.020]   They should.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.100]   They should be some diminutive of pants.
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.100]   Panties.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.100]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.100]   They shouldn't be.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.100]   They should be.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.100]   They should be.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:17.100]   Something else.
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.100]   They see in frilly and beautiful and wonderful.
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.100]   How about lady trousers?
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.100]   That's a diminutive.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.100]   Yes.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.100]   You've been watching too much top gear.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.100]   Really?
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.100]   That's a top gear.
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.100]   It sounds like something you hear in top gear.
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.100]   It does.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.740]   You call them lady trousers.
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.020]   You know, it's the Queen's Jubilee.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.020]   What does that mean?
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.020]   Is there a knickers?
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.620]   Is there anybody from the Commonwealth in the studio today?
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:39.260]   Anybody from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the American Samoa is anywhere?
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:41.780]   Where are you from, sir?
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:44.860]   So you don't know about the Queen's Jubilee?
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.860]   This is a big deal.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.340]   You see the picture of her firing like a rifle?
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:52.180]   They had to lower the river for the Queen because her boat was so high.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.660]   It couldn't go under the new Malayan Bridge.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.340]   So they actually lowered the river.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.900]   That's power.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.580]   It's a big boat.
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.620]   The Jubilee is what her -- is her 50th year in power?
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.620]   60.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.620]   60.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.620]   Wow.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.620]   So it's her diamond Jubilee.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.860]   She's been on a throne for 60 years.
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:11.860]   That's amazing.
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.380]   And she doesn't look at my vice prunes.
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.380]   So -- Oh, I got a groan.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:19.380]   I got a groan.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.380]   Look at that hat.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.700]   She's -- Is that a mushroom?
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.700]   What is that?
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:26.660]   She's playing Mario.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.460]   She's waving from the Royal Barge on the River Thames.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:33.300]   I'm going to float till I -- I love this.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.300]   You know why I love this?
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.740]   Do you love this because it's medieval?
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:40.380]   It brings back -- it just reminds me of the good old days.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.780]   Oh, yeah, the plague.
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.980]   Those were the good old days.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:49.180]   It's the last day of the country's under adult supervision.
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.660]   Actually the -- let's go.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:56.140]   The Queen's Flotilla was taken -- the idea for it was taken from an old painting.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.020]   Did we finish the stamps.com ad long ago?
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.660]   It was an interesting segue.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:04.140]   It was a four-day diamond Jubilee.
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.900]   So they were trying to figure out how do we make this really cool?
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.180]   How do we celebrate?
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:14.300]   There's nothing like, you know, a river full of boats with the Queen on a Royal Barge at
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.300]   the front.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:24.300]   So this was a three-century old painting of a previous royal pageant that they -- they
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.780]   -- No, they copied.
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:26.780]   Copied.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.780]   Check this out.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:28.780]   That's Mike.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:29.780]   That's Mike.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.780]   I idea of a -- She's shooting a cannon.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:31.780]   That's a -- that's like a machine gun.
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.780]   Where'd you find that?
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.420]   If I search for Queen Elizabeth Shoots' machine gun?
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.420]   Yeah, Queen.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.420]   Right, old Jubilee.
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:38.420]   Right.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.420]   I don't know if it was real or not.
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.940]   You might be able to get an animated GIF.
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940]   That'd be kind of cool.
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:45.820]   Yeah, here it is.
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:50.100]   The Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebration, 62 guns -- no, it's not her firing.
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.380]   That's her firing a gun.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:52.380]   I'm sorry we're not plugged into Mike.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:54.900]   I wish the hell we could see that.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.100]   Chatroom will give it to me.
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.100]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.100]   Chatroom, I want a picture.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.100]   This is so much.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.100]   This is so cool.
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.100]   Watch this.
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.100]   Chatroom.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:03.100]   Yes, Leon.
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.300]   I want a -- that's just my imagination.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:11.540]   I want a picture of the Queen firing a rifle chatroom on the Jubilee, on the Jubilee, working
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.540]   with an umbrella.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.540]   Working.
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:20.900]   Okay, you're not that fast.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.820]   I can't see -- we can't show people.
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.380]   You're pulling up pictures on your computers.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.820]   It's leaving the audience out, processing.
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.740]   Look, and here it is.
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:31.580]   Ladies and gentlemen, throwing it to be a noir.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:35.860]   There it is, the Queen Jesus Christ.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:36.860]   How awesome is that?
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:39.060]   You're not going to get her angry.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.060]   Wow.
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.260]   You do not want to get -- but I'm glad she's waiting.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.260]   Why not?
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.260]   She has a kick she's doing.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.100]   Now you're proud to be from New Zealand.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.060]   I bet you are, sir.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:49.060]   You're a proud team.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:50.620]   You never see Obama doing that.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:54.540]   Actually, I lost Michael Dukakis the election.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.900]   We're in the little tank helmet.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:56.900]   That was a big mistake.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.900]   You have to be careful.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.780]   He did have her steely look of determination on rage.
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:01.780]   You know what?
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:04.220]   She could get elected president right now.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.060]   We're sorry your majesty made mistake.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.780]   As Jay Spinn says, that's a fake photo.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.020]   Oh, I don't care.
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.020]   I'm in this room.
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.020]   I just don't care.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.020]   I love it.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.020]   That's a photograph.
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.020]   That's not fake.
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.020]   She's squinting.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.020]   She's squinting.
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.020]   She's aiming.
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.020]   All right.
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.020]   Or do you --
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.020]   I like the trigger.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.020]   That's all I have to say.
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.020]   Trigger hand looks great.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:24.020]   It's way old.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.020]   What?
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.020]   All right.
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.020]   Let's get back to the story.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.020]   Tech news.
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:30.020]   Google promises to unveil.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.340]   Then you're going to this event.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.100]   The next dimension of Google Maps.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:37.540]   Right before Apple releases how it's going to change the force itself.
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:38.780]   You have written Google forever.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:39.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:41.780]   So Google is having an event.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.780]   I don't know what they're going to do.
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.220]   What's the difference from iOS?
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.060]   They're all competing with each other.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.740]   Navigation, location, mobile location finding is everything.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:52.740]   What could you do?
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.740]   I'm tempted to go to this event.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.500]   But I just don't know.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.500]   Is it one of those events you go to?
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.500]   You go, "Well, that wasn't that interesting."
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.660]   It's going to be 3D.
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:03.660]   They couldn't make the product better in Android.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.220]   I mean, it's all about mobile.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:08.140]   It's all about Android because I can't do anything on iOS because Apple's going to drop
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.140]   them.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.300]   So they've got to make Android Maps better.
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.140]   But they're already pretty freaking awesome.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.660]   So I don't know what they're going to do.
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.620]   They're already making them better because they're doing this passive aggressive thing
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:23.580]   where, for example, you don't get verbal instructions on iOS.
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.980]   You do get them on Android.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:30.140]   You don't get the revised recalculating thing that you get with most GPS's on iOS.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.140]   You only get it on Android already.
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:32.140]   You think that's Google being a progressive?
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.140]   And they're already a progressive.
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.140]   And they're already a progressive.
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.780]   I mean, if Apple's doing that, I'd be surprised.
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.580]   And they're already traffic aware on Google.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:42.100]   And the traffic aware thing, which I use, is amazing.
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:46.020]   This is the best navigator you can get.
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:47.420]   I know you're a big fan.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:50.140]   This phone, as old as it is, has not got a single scratch on it.
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:52.900]   Is it a passive aggressive or is that Google just favoring their own platform?
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.100]   You know, the other thing they have what I'm doing is they're doing more indoor mapping.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.220]   So for businesses, like airports especially.
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.220]   It's pretty cool.
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.220]   Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:05.260]   But when we were at CES, they had maps of the trade show on Google Maps.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.860]   So you'd walk in and you could get to use maps.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:09.660]   I think maybe they were maps of inside your body.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:10.660]   Mmm.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:14.380]   They have the synthetic biology guys too.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.620]   One thing I am very happy about.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:21.220]   They did put Google Places in the maps now, but now they've added the Zagat guides free.
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:22.220]   That's cool.
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:23.220]   They bought Zagat.
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:24.220]   Yeah, I think that's cool.
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.540]   In fact, I had a, I'd been paying for Zagat.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.540]   Is it Zagat or Zagat?
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:29.540]   I don't know.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.540]   It's Zagat.
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:31.540]   Zagat.
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:32.540]   Zagat.
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:33.540]   It's a matter.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.540]   Nina, Nina, Nina, Nina.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.540]   Nina Zagat once and I believe I recall correctly.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:39.540]   She introduced herself as Nina Zagat, but I could be wrong.
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:40.540]   It could be.
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:41.540]   It's pronounced.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.540]   Whatever.
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.820]   It won't be in business in five years.
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:47.100]   No, because Google bought it.
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.100]   That's one reason.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.100]   And Yelp is still better.
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.100]   I got.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.100]   I was right.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.100]   Zagat.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.100]   Nina was right with her own name.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.100]   Zagat.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:55.100]   Rhymes with cat.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.100]   Like the cat.
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.100]   Zagat.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:58.100]   But we're asking where the asbestos is.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:59.100]   Zagat.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.100]   It's Zagat or Zagat.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.100]   One of the three.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.100]   The guy.
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:05.540]   The fact channel says.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:11.300]   So anyway, they actually gave me a free guide because I had some subscription money left.
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.300]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.300]   They said, "Would you like a free guide?"
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.820]   I said, "Yes, and the one I ordered, you're going to love this."
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:17.820]   Baltimore.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:18.820]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.820]   How'd you know?
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:20.820]   It's a good city.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:21.820]   Wonderful city.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:22.820]   I like the waterfront.
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.900]   Wouldn't go inland if I were you.
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.820]   Did you see the new Chromebooks?
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:27.820]   Yes.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:28.820]   What?
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.660]   They have new ones?
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.660]   Better Stronger Faster.
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.660]   Yep, better Stronger Faster.
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.660]   Just as relevant.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:36.460]   Yes, no longer the atom processor.
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.220]   Now they've got Celerons.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.220]   Celery?
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:40.220]   Celerons.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.220]   Celery.
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.220]   Celery.
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.220]   I don't even know where they got them from.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:44.220]   Are they just Intel's make-
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.620]   There's a room full of Celeron chips somewhere in the bottom.
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.420]   They're all rated the room.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.420]   They gave them a deal.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.060]   They don't have a cord, whatever's?
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.540]   No, they're Celerons.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:54.620]   Geez, Louise, Google.
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:56.460]   Nobody's going to buy these things.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.620]   Yeah, I tried one.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:58.620]   We have one in the-
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:23:59.620]   And that book has not died.
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.620]   I know.
[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:01.620]   I just came into my intern.
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:02.620]   He said, "Do you have a laptop I could use for the summer?"
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:03.620]   I said, "Yeah."
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.620]   I still like Chromebooks.
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:05.620]   Any quit.
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:06.620]   He's gone.
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:07.780]   I don't know where he went.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:13.060]   I still like Chromebooks because you can give one to a guest or a five-year-old and
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.620]   they cannot get into your settings.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:15.620]   They can't use it.
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.620]   They just close it and say, "I don't want this."
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.620]   They can write emails.
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.620]   That's how they're even bad.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:20.620]   They say Angry Birds?
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.620]   No.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:22.620]   Sorry.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:23.620]   Actually, it does have Angry Birds.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:24.620]   It does play Angry Birds.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:25.620]   They all want to play poorly.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.620]   The new one has played a little bit better.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:30.940]   So we've talked for years about the Google Book deal.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:31.940]   That's how long I've known you.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:33.580]   It's been going on for years.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.140]   Google scanned books.
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:37.300]   The authors and publishers said, "Whoa, wait a minute.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.300]   You can't scan those books."
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.300]   Right.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.560]   And the irony, of course, is that before this all began, everybody was idealistically
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.660]   talking about how great it would be to digitize the world's books.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:47.740]   Except somebody wrote them.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.340]   Yes, except the authors.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:56.580]   So it turns out, finally, a federal judge ruled this week that authors and photographers
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:03.540]   could go forward with a class action lawsuit over scanning with the Google Books.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:07.180]   They asked-- the Google asked the judge to remove the authors' guild in a photographers'
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.460]   group from the lawsuit.
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.860]   They said a class action wasn't appropriate because many authors were actually in favor
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:12.860]   of scanning.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.380]   And they should be.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:17.300]   And they should be.
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:20.380]   Well, how do you feel-- OK, both of you are authors.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:24.740]   I mean, Doc, don't you worry that Google will scan your books and then make them available?
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.540]   I would hope they do.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:31.580]   I can tell you how handy it is when doing research to be able to look inside a book.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:33.140]   And I've still bought a zillion of them.
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:35.500]   I mean, Clutrain, by the way, still sells well.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.020]   It's been online for free for years, ever.
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.820]   It's been online for free for years.
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:39.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:41.700]   In fact, it's-- being online for free has probably helped sales.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:42.700]   I agree.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:48.380]   So I think it's-- I think-- I understand they're-- they're complaint, but I think it's misplaced.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:49.380]   I agree with that.
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:52.940]   It's a complete misunderstanding of the way technology works.
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:56.020]   So it's the usual case of the existing--
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.020]   The norms.
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:58.020]   The norms.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.020]   Not understanding how technology works.
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.620]   But shouldn't the norms still be allowed to file suit if they want to?
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.980]   I just wouldn't have gone record there.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:09.740]   Nobody watching, listening, or in any way involved with the show is a norm.
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:10.740]   And I wouldn't have been--
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.060]   Except there's a guy in the second row, Norm Johnson.
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:15.740]   Norm, I'm not talking about you, Norm.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:17.660]   Google has applied from some new TLDs.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:24.660]   You know, the ICANN folks have added arbitrary-- anything you want TLDs.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:25.660]   There are lots, though.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:26.660]   What is it, Doc?
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:27.660]   150,000?
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:28.660]   That was 250.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:29.660]   It's expensive.
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.100]   so Google's getting doc Google. They're gonna apply.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:36.500]   'Cause then you could go to google doc Google.
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.380]   (laughing)
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:40.200]   - That doesn't make any sense.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.160]   - Let's go to google doc Google.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.660]   - What if you went to calm.google.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.660]   - That would be a good one.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.520]   - Then you would have a backwards group.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.600]   (laughing)
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.000]   - They're dyslexics.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.080]   (laughing)
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.220]   - They got docs. That would make sense
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:56.820]   for your google docs docs. Or doc, you might want that.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:57.840]   Doc docs.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.180]   - Doc, what did that?
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.020]   - Doc docs.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:01.400]   - Until Google docs came along,
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.760]   I was among the top docs and I'm gone now.
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.600]   So yeah.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.440]   - Eat that.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.900]   That twitter did that to me.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.160]   Dot YouTube, in case you didn't know where you were going,
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.020]   to see those crutch shot videos.
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.280]   Angry Annoying Orange.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.280]   And this is my favorite.LOL.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.600]   - That's great.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.580]   Cheeseburger's gotta be in the running for that one.
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.640]   - They wanna register dot LOL.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.480]   - OMG.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.880]   - Is it a new, I'm gonna get OMG hang on.
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.640]   - Oh, I think AOL has OMG.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.480]   - Dang.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.600]   - WTF, can I get that one?
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.440]   - Yes.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.600]   - Dot WTF.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.080]   That's good, I like it.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.880]   Dot Rafe, you should have dot Rafe.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.640]   - I almost got Rafe.com and that's a stupid luggage.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.560]   - You know doc, if you registered dot doc, not dot docs,
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.320]   that you could get some traffic.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:47.000]   - Yeah, I missed it.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.800]   I wanted to do that and I missed it by not much.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.880]   - Didn't have a quarter million lying around.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.120]   - Yeah, and that was back when it was 75 bucks from Internick.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.000]   - Oh, you mean there is actually a dot doc?
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.880]   - I think, no, no, not a dot.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.600]   There's a doc dot, you know, that I wanted to get.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.000]   - Oh, doc dot, yeah, I should have gotten Leo dot.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.480]   If we only knew if wishes were fishes,
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.800]   you were around at the beginning doc,
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.320]   you should have known this.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.280]   - Yeah, I did, in fact, I actually thought
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.400]   it would be a great business to go into the, you know,
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.720]   staffing up a lot of domain names
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.640]   and selling them for a lot of money,
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.760]   but I thought it'd be very scamming
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.400]   and a crap business to be in.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.760]   And so, there it is.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.520]   - Be scamming yourself all the way to the bank.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.480]   - Yeah, especially with art.com.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.400]   I remember having that guy in my--
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.040]   - How much do you sell it for?
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.440]   - $1 million.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.440]   - Art.com.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.920]   - Art.com is, you can go to art.com.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:34.760]   - What do you get?
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:35.800]   - It's a huge website.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.640]   - For what, art?
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.800]   - Yeah, for posters, frames.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.640]   - Are you right?
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:40.960]   - Posters, art prints, framed art.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   - Yeah, they paid a million dollars for art.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   - When million dollars?
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.280]   - A million dollars.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.040]   - And yet, I think zappos.com
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.840]   probably does a lot more traffic.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.680]   - Yeah, probably.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:51.520]   - I know it'd be a little crazy.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.440]   - generic is not what you want.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.280]   sex.com, what do you get?
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.120]   - I don't know what.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:56.960]   Go check it out.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.120]   - I've never never tried it.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:58.960]   - I don't know.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:04.120]   Actually, Alexis Madrigal, who I really like,
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.880]   she writes, is a she or a he?
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.280]   - It's a he, actually.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.680]   - He writes for, he's a senior editor at The Atlantic.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.520]   writes for The Atlantic Magazine,
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.280]   has been doing some really good pieces.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.400]   He's got an article on The Case for Facebook.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.200]   - Yeah, he's making a point that the stock
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.680]   is not that bad an idea because Facebook is
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.400]   20% of the internet.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.240]   - It is.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.280]   - Which is a very valid argument.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:32.080]   - We may not like that, but it's an interesting argument.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.360]   - Yeah, it may, it was an overpriced IPO.
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.200]   People are all up in arms because the stock went down
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:42.200]   and Facebook managed to extract the maximum possible value
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.640]   they could from the IPO, by the way.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.040]   - Which is what they're supposed to do.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.360]   That was their--
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.320]   - Their CFO deserves a patent back.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.480]   Now it's not good overall for other IPOs, but--
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.840]   - No, you know who's mad?
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.080]   The speculators are mad because the Muppets didn't make it pop.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.880]   And if the Muppets had made, they'd made a lot of money.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:01.960]   - It would have made more, and then they could do
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:02.800]   a secondary free free free money.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:05.960]   - They were hoping that there'd be this big retail,
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.880]   Jim Kramer was calling it over the transom purchases
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.000]   by people, normal people who didn't realize
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.600]   Facebook norms, they call them Muppets,
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.720]   which is actually probably better.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:15.920]   I'm gonna call them Muppets.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.840]   So that's what they call us, not you,
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.680]   'cause you're sophisticated, but me, they call them Muppet.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.360]   Because they were hoping the Muppets would come in
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.440]   and bring that stock price to 40, 50, 60 bucks,
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.720]   they could sell before the end of the day,
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.720]   get out, watch it crash, and that's why they're really upset.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.560]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.400]   - They didn't get the pop.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.720]   - They're just shooting Muppets, it should be idiots.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.720]   - The Muggles, they're Muggles.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:36.720]   - The Muggles, the Muggles.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:38.720]   - The Muggles, the Muggles didn't come through.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.120]   - The Muggles didn't come through.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.040]   And NASDAQ kinda screwed it up because they delayed it.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.360]   They didn't give 'em a chance to--
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.800]   - Well, NASDAQ, there was more--
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.600]   - More traffic in Facebook shares
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:52.600]   than there has been ever for any stock.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.760]   Then NASDAQ normally has an entire day for all its stocks.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.200]   Facebook shares were that many more.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.400]   - So the Muppets did buy, but I guess the Muppets didn't buy.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.600]   - And then they sold, and then they bought it,
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.280]   and sold, it was a disaster.
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.640]   - Yeah.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.280]   - They just didn't have the bandwidth.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.040]   Anyway, Facebook is still a valuable company.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.440]   As that looks, it points out.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:12.360]   You know, they have lock-in, they have photo sharing,
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.800]   they have everybody who's connected to whom,
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.240]   and they'll eventually have an ad network, I believe,
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.560]   outside of Facebook.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.840]   So it's still a valuable company.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.520]   The question is, is it as valuable to the tune of $38,
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.280]   or even $30 to share?
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.680]   - Well, here's, and I'm gonna defer to you, John,
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.080]   'cause you actually understand this stuff.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.360]   You talk to Andrew all the time.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.600]   Do you still do the show with Andrew?
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:32.440]   - Yes.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.600]   - So you know about-- - DHNplug.com.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.600]   - You know about stock stuff.
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.160]   - After you go to know@gendershow.com,
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.280]   go to DHNplug.com, and then you can go to
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.800]   channeldevork.com and then devork.org/NA.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.320]   - So one of the things people were complaining about
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.120]   was that-- - Pretty good.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.960]   - Fate, very nicely done.
[01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.880]   - Well, I was just feeling dead air.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.120]   - Very nicely done.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.720]   One of the things people were complaining about
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.720]   was that Facebook's price to earning,
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.800]   its valuation of stock market was over one.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.320]   Right now, it's at 88 bucks,
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.080]   I think the peak was $110, price to earning,
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.120]   not price, price to earning.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:05.960]   - Re-ratio. - E-ratio.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:06.960]   - E-ratio. - E-ratio.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.360]   - Amazon is 171.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.200]   - The P-ratio's 171?
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.040]   I don't think. - 171.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.040]   - And that's what I find interesting is that
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.600]   nobody's saying anything about Amazon being overvalued
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.040]   and they're worth twice as much.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.040]   - That may be a reflection of a bad quarter.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.680]   That's not necessarily what it really--
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.800]   - Economic metrics don't apply this early on in a company.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.880]   - It's brand new, we don't know what it's gonna be.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.640]   The question is, could you grow that much?
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.400]   But if Amazon's worth 171, price to earn.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.520]   - Dollars? - No.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.240]   - Yeah, but that may be to do with the earnings of one--
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.480]   - It has been for a long time.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:44.480]   - No, no, well, I don't know, it has been for a while.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.880]   Oh, you're right, earnings have been down.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:46.880]   You're right, maybe it is.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.560]   - It's just some of these things, you know,
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.040]   just transitory.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.720]   - Wow, is that PDE? - Yeah.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.080]   - Google is 13, now that's Apple. - Yeah, that's 13.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.840]   - Yeah, that's about right. - Google's around that too.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.800]   - That's because they don't expect it.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.040]   The price, the earnings per share,
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.960]   should reflect the growth rate of the company's generally--
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.040]   - These are older companies. - These are older companies.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.280]   - These are older than Amazon. - So, 100 to one--
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.200]   - Amazon is as old as Amazon.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:12.040]   - This is gonna be doubling every year in earnings.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.480]   So if the thing's 13,
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.680]   this pretty much means the company's stabilized.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.680]   - Right.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:19.800]   - It's not gonna double, although you don't know.
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.120]   - You don't know if you do. - If they come up
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.640]   with that TV set, which a lot of people don't think
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.160]   it's gonna happen, some people do.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.320]   - I don't, I'm very spectacle.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.120]   - I'm very much-- - It's got to go.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.400]   - You're spectacle?
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.240]   - Good one, he got me.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.160]   (laughing)
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.680]   - Those spectacles are on.
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.960]   - Ray Fiedelman, he does the reporter's round table,
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:39.880]   he's good, he's got the AP style guy in his head.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.980]   - John C. Devorak, channeldevorak.com.
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:45.720]   DocSurls@doc.surls.com.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.560]   - Yeah, that'll do it.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.000]   - That'll do it, that'll take you to the Berkman Center
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.400]   in Doc's blog.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.960]   We're brought to you this week by audible.com.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.640]   You know what I was listening to on Audible,
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.280]   and I really, and I think it's apropos,
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.360]   I was listening to a brand new history
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.200]   of the Second World War.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.640]   And you were mentioning duplicity,
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.160]   and how you wouldn't expect the government to,
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.040]   you know, state its intentions.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.880]   In fact, some of the things governments say
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.960]   may be intended to mislead.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.640]   - Yes. - Yes.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.080]   Hitler did that.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:15.920]   - They all do it.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:16.760]   - Hitler, Hitler did that. - Are you?
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.600]   - Are you? - It's over.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.560]   - It's over. - Yeah.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.320]   - Godwin's Law has been invoked.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.520]   This is a, there's so many great books on Audible.com,
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.200]   over 100,000 now.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.320]   And you know, I was listening to Stephen King,
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.120]   and I wanted something in antidote, not in antidote,
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.120]   an anodyne, something to refresh the palette,
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.320]   an amuse-boosh in between books of the stand,
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.920]   which is a very, very long book.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.200]   So I got this new book.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:41.960]   - You have a five minute commute to this.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.680]   - No, I know, I don't listen very much.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.720]   Called the storm of war, a new history of the Second World War,
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.440]   it's actually great, it's fascinating.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.840]   I've even, my son is even in listening to this.
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.840]   He's learning, you know, this is interesting.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.680]   He's learning more from listening to books
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:57.440]   as I drive him to school than he learns in school like that.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.320]   - Well, yeah, it's a public school, right?
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.520]   - No, no, he goes to a very fancy expensive school.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.360]   - Same thing.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.560]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.240]   They're smoking pot, basically.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.160]   - That's good.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.720]   - Yeah, the teachers go, "Hey, you wanna light up
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.240]   "before the glass?"
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.160]   - No, they don't do that.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.000]   They don't, that's wrong.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.280]   I shouldn't have said that.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:14.760]   I'm on the board of trustees, I'm gonna be fired.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.400]   (laughing)
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.080]   - You need to just dig a hole for yourself.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:18.920]   That's great. - That's great.
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:19.760]   - That's cool.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:20.600]   - Hogwarts.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.760]   (laughing)
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:22.880]   But back to Audible.com.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.840]   - You got out of it.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.040]   - Yeah, I did get out of it.
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:28.560]   So do you guys listen to audiobooks, anybody?
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.800]   - No. - All the hands went up.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.120]   - More podcasts. - Yeah.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.360]   - Doc, is your book, I wonder, let me look, is your--
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.080]   - Yeah, there's an audio book version of it
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:40.120]   'cause I recorded it, I spoke it.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.040]   So I don't know if that's the Audible version
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.120]   or if that's some other version,
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.320]   but there's definitely an audiobook version.
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.560]   - That seems like a lot of work.
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.680]   - There is, Brian Amoris does the--
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.520]   - It took two days.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.360]   - Is it took two days?
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.040]   - Yeah, it took two days to sell it.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.480]   - Let me see, let me search for an intention economy.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.160]   Most every audiobook that comes out is unaudible,
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.440]   but apparently yours is not.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.600]   However, Clue Train is, which is a great--
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.840]   - Yeah, I think Train is.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.640]   With all four authors reading their parts.
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:07.400]   - Yeah, really. - Of the original version.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.960]   Now, the 10th anniversary, there's a voiceover guy.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.800]   - Oh, so there's two of them?
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.160]   - Yeah, there's a 10th anniversary edition.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.600]   There's new chapters by the four authors
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.640]   and then an additional chapter by JP Raga Swami.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:20.640]   - Oh, he's great, I like to--
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.840]   - And Dan Gilmore and Jake McKee.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.440]   - Oh, what fun.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.280]   - Yeah.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.760]   - So, I'll tell you, you can get inspired,
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.280]   you can learn, oh yeah, so there's the one narrated,
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.720]   there's several of these on here, interesting.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:36.560]   You can learn--
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.720]   - I don't know which ones are audible though,
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:39.600]   I mean, are the audible company?
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.680]   And I'm not looking at it, I don't know.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.280]   - Audible makes deals often with everybody else.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.920]   So that's the thing, is almost every audiobook is unaudible.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.280]   I bet yours will be, it just isn't yet.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.600]   That would be my guess.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:54.160]   - It could be, I get little notes from the publisher
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.480]   on what deal's been done with who,
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:57.680]   right, or what's been done with Audible yet.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.200]   - Paris by Sweden, year in the city of light
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.040]   and dark chocolate, sounds good.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.200]   If these walls could talk,
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.440]   you'll see this is the other kind of book
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.440]   I love to listen to, an intimate history of the home,
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.960]   these are kind of like sociology meets history,
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.080]   I love that stuff, I love it.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.520]   Audible.com, I'll tell you what,
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.440]   go to audible.com/twit and the number two,
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.800]   Twit2, one word.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.640]   And you can sign up for the Platinum account,
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.040]   that's two books a month, first month's free,
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.720]   first two credits are free, in most cases that's two books,
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.280]   although if you're doing Game of Thrones,
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.920]   each of those books because it's so long, it's two credits.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.680]   So you could get one Game of Thrones,
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.960]   or you could get two other books.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.560]   Just really, the new Lyndon Johnson biography
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.760]   by Robert Caro is out now.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.160]   I love this stuff, listen to the first couple of volumes
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.600]   on Audible, Audible Master of the Senate,
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.600]   ooh, that was good.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.600]   Audible.com/twit2, give it a try, today you will like it.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:01.400]   Let us move on here, what other big stories
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.360]   are going on this week?
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.700]   Ivy Bridge laptop chips are out.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:13.760]   The SpaceX cargo ship is back.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.520]   That's cool, that's cool.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:16.920]   That's cool, Space Travel East Coast.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.560]   Elon Musk, aka Tony Stark.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.880]   Yes, he's Tony Stark.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:26.880]   Has made a rocket and put his own capsule on it,
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.400]   which went up to the space station.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.720]   Dragly then grappled with a robot arm
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.040]   because a source tells me getting approval
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.240]   for automatic docking software would have involved.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.760]   Basically every nation that has an interest
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.560]   in the space station approving it.
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.320]   Wait, you could have done that, but they didn't,
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.000]   they just said, well, we'll grapple you?
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.960]   Yes, it's Newtonian physics, how hard can it be?
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.800]   Right.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.480]   But if you have a mistake, then you punch a hole in the tank.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.320]   Yeah, yes, yes.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.160]   You punch a hole in the ISS and people die,
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.520]   so that's not good, so they grappled with the robot arm,
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.960]   they opened it up and this is,
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.560]   and then it just splashed down,
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.400]   and it was perfect recovery, perfect mission.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.680]   It was, it's only its second flight.
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.400]   Yeah, and this thing, they're trying to make this
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:10.320]   space capsule, you know, human rated,
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:11.840]   so this cargo ship that went up,
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:14.560]   the driverless minivan will eventually have people in it
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:15.680]   up to seven.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:16.520]   Up to how many?
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.360]   Seven.
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.360]   Wow.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.480]   And Elon Musk is doing, now is he,
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.360]   he's spending the big profits from Tesla?
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.200]   No.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.640]   PayPal, then Tesla, now SpaceX.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.480]   Wow.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.320]   Tony Stark.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.720]   Banking, cars, what's next?
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.200]   Well, he builds a giant tower in New York City.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:33.840]   And where does he launch these things from?
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.680]   Where?
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.520]   A secret island base.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.360]   No.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.200]   Yes.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.040]   Original space capsule rocket.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:39.040]   That's right.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.040]   That's right.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.600]   And it goes down under the water,
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.640]   and then comes back up.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.680]   It's amazing.
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:45.200]   No.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.240]   It opens up the top of the volcano,
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:46.920]   and the rocket goes up.
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.320]   You guys are teasing me now.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.640]   Only slightly.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.160]   Wow.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.680]   That is pretty cool.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.240]   I know people were watching this as if it were like,
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.560]   you know, a big deal.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:00.280]   It is a big deal to have a private industry
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.440]   get up into orbit.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.360]   I mean, previously--
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:02.960]   It is, it's amazing.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:03.680]   It's amazing.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.080]   Previously, private, non-private industries like Boeing,
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.520]   Lockheed, these non-private companies
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.800]   are obviously government-owned.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.760]   A startup.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.320]   You're right.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:12.800]   You're right.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.040]   And we have-- private companies have launched, obviously,
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:19.400]   space ship spacecraft into-- not just orbit,
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.680]   but geosynchronous so far, far away.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.680]   But to have a startup interface with the space program
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.440]   means we hope that NASA can actually
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.400]   do what it does, which is push the boundaries.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.040]   That the boundary is no longer getting things into orbit.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.160]   It is now going to Mars, going to the asteroids.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.720]   And we can leave getting to orbit to smaller, way more
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.000]   cost-effective private companies.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:44.640]   Cheap.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.720]   Yes.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.680]   Some good news.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.720]   You learn once the mine asteroids too.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.920]   And it wants to make that private.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.000]   They're doing a company.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:51.500]   That's right.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:52.000]   Good luck.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:52.520]   That truly does.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.040]   You don't get to invest in that and others.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.600]   And I think that's a great idea.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.680]   They've got an asteroid in mind that has a ton of platinum.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:00.440]   I think it is platinum.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:01.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.600]   That's pretty cool.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.640]   That's pretty cool.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.760]   We need that.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:05.240]   Fiasco.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.040]   We need it to build iPhones.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:06.760]   Fiasco.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:08.760]   Why?
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.200]   The mining and asteroid.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.200]   It's crazy.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.400]   No, it's great idea.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.880]   It's a great idea.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   You don't think that'll happen?
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:15.400]   No.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.840]   We got to get Jerry Pournell on.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.800]   He'll tell you.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.480]   He'll talk you down.
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.600]   It's good stuff.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.760]   What do you think we had?
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.080]   We did a special, which you can watch, by the way.
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.360]   It was fascinating before the show,
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:30.000]   about with a guy who had done a great talk on a software
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.680]   X, the Google talks, about a genome compiler.
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.560]   And he's now shipping in its software
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.200]   that you then can take bits and pieces of different genomes
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.680]   and create a new genome.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:42.320]   And then he brought a friend who's making a genome printer,
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.400]   basically a maker bot for genes that you would then
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.280]   inject in cells.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.120]   And the cells would create the thing.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:52.200]   Like he wants to do a Kickstarter project for glowing trees.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.480]   He says, easy.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.160]   You take an oak tree and inject some glowworm DNA?
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.640]   Boom.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.840]   That's like a 3D printer for a new genome.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.560]   Let's do it.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.240]   Pretty cool.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.080]   These guys, I'm sitting here.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:02.560]   I'm thinking--
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:03.080]   I like it.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.120]   This is a revolution.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.600]   We're sitting next to these guys could be changing everything
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:08.200]   in 10 years.
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.320]   The trees could be glowing.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.720]   You could have three arms.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.000]   Possibly what could possibly go wrong.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:13.520]   Yes.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.960]   Well, although that says that said,
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.280]   the same thing is true with private industry, with space,
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.240]   asteroid mining, print your own genome.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.240]   A lot of things can go wrong.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.200]   A lot of things will go wrong.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.880]   A lot of things need to go wrong for us to go forward.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.600]   It's called evolution.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.280]   That's right.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.280]   That means the exact--
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.560]   Evolution.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.280]   And by the way, we made it to its special 126,
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:38.960]   if you want to see it.
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.160]   It was actually fascinating.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.120]   Good news.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.680]   Act a treaty may be on the way down.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.720]   Now, we signed it in the US President Obama
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.040]   signed it.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.800]   This is that anti-counterfeiting treaty
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.440]   that has so many bad things in it.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:52.040]   It's almost hard to list them all.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.400]   But the European Union will be voting on it in July.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.760]   And so far, three different parliament committees
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:42:59.760]   have rejected it.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.280]   They has to get passed by every country in the European Union.
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.120]   The industry committee, the civil liberties committee,
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.720]   and the legal affairs committee, all registered disapproval.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:12.120]   It's not over yet, but that lady's warming up.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:14.360]   It could be good news.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:14.920]   OK.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.840]   Just saw a pass on-- well, we've talked a lot about ACTA
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.080]   and how bad it is.
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:20.040]   It's a bad actor.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.480]   It's a bad actor.
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:25.240]   Maybe there's something good going here.
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:27.760]   Wi-Fi and cellular data will account for 60%
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.600]   of all internet traffic by the year 2016.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.400]   That's funny.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.760]   Not a surprise.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:36.480]   Wi-Fi, cellular data, 60%.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:39.040]   Netflix has something like 80% of all traffic
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.920]   Facebook gets 20%.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:43.240]   We're already at 200%.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.520]   Some of that could be going over Wi-Fi or 3G,
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.000]   and that's all.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.640]   And it has to because the home connections
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.040]   are going to be not improved.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:51.720]   Right.
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:52.360]   That's right.
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:54.400]   That may be where the future lies.
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.920]   There are two new elements on the periodic table.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.160]   I know you're excited about this.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.760]   The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:02.520]   I love that.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.280]   I want to join.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:06.200]   They're man-made elements.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:09.440]   They were synthesized in Dubna, Russia.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.960]   I'm skeptical.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:11.600]   No.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.880]   So were the guys at Lawrence Livermore National Labs,
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:14.640]   just down the street there?
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.120]   Of course they'd be skeptical.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.480]   And they confirmed it.
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.680]   I don't know what one of them is called Livermorium
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.480]   or whatever it is then.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:24.280]   Livermorium honoring Lawrence Livermore National Labs.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.200]   They did that to get to approve it.
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.480]   And it's like the Leo Le Porte Award.
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.960]   Fluorovium.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.800]   If I started the Leo Le Porte award--
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:34.800]   I would approve that.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.240]   You would.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.200]   I'm Leo Le Porte, and I approve that message.
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.680]   Fluorovium.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.320]   It'll be-- the symbol would be Fi.
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.000]   The advantage of a Livermorium sandwich
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.720]   is that the element only lasts for like a nanosecond,
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:50.360]   and then it decays, and you don't need it.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.920]   Leaving 20 protons.
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:52.400]   That's right.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:55.120]   Just lying around on the table, and your mother will say--
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.320]   Zorium, misterium.
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.720]   Clean up the protons.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:58.640]   You must sturdium.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.320]   That's what we need.
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:03.480]   Science, as long as we're in the science department,
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.600]   has confirmed there is an old person smell.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:08.480]   I can believe that.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:11.160]   I love it all.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.840]   I'm not taking enough showers.
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:13.360]   That's right.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.560]   I smell them right now.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.040]   You do.
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:16.040]   Very funny.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:19.280]   The back channel--
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.600]   It's your upper lip.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:21.600]   I forgot to tell you what to do.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.520]   Researchers have confirmed the first time
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.640]   that older people have a recognizable body
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.680]   that cannot be fully explained by grooming diet or--
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:28.880]   The science is in.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:29.880]   Science is in.
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:30.400]   The science is in.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.960]   And you're so lucky that I'm not there, I guess.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:37.480]   We're all old people except for Rafe, who's going to be soon.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.480]   Very old.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.080]   It's getting older by the minute on this show.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:42.920]   Old by associate.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.600]   Facebook says that it's a look at the ads.
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:47.600]   Apparently, young people are able to just sniffing.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.080]   I know why.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.480]   Well, they can hear a lot of weird stuff, these young people.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:52.280]   I hear they hear tones.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.080]   We can't.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.000]   That's what I understand.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.040]   And they can smell us coming a lot away.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:59.240]   Just like dogs.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.360]   Just like dogs.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.040]   I knew I didn't like young people.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.880]   All federal agencies must have an API.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:06.400]   What?
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.080]   Decrees the president.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.400]   He doesn't know what an API is.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.920]   Executive order 1,300-- no, 13,500--
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:22.160]   he's boy, he's been busy-- 13,571 requires executive departments
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.400]   and agencies to identify ways to use
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.440]   innovative technology, streamline delivery of services, lower
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:27.040]   cost, increased delivery of service time,
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.920]   and improve the customer experience.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.800]   Barack Obama has directed federal agencies
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:34.480]   to deploy web APIs.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.120]   Why?
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:37.320]   Open government, baby.
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:41.080]   Deploy the APIs.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:42.440]   He must mean something different.
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.120]   He'll be--
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:45.360]   He'll be directly.
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:48.000]   He doesn't say if their data has to be like--
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.240]   Well, I think it is about clean.
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.560]   I think it is about open government.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.520]   It's about what they call smart disclosure.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.120]   Get ready.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.360]   Here is the federal API.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.720]   This one is the list.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.520]   It's in the implementation on this one, obviously.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.000]   But it is really cool if all these government agencies, which
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.640]   are taking our money--
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:08.640]   and money nobody has-- and to collect data, which
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.520]   is what they all do, they do these surveys
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:12.520]   and collect all this data.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.800]   If we could then get that data--
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:16.440]   well, we wouldn't need Wolfram, else, would we?
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.080]   No.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.440]   We just go and get it.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.920]   This is a list from apievangelist.com.
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:24.200]   He has put checkboxes next to all of the agencies that
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.640]   have a digital strategy and Xs next to all the agencies
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:28.320]   that do not.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.960]   It looks like more Xs than anything.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:31.680]   I'm looking for a checkbox.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.520]   I don't see any.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:35.400]   Don't see a checkbox.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:40.080]   The department of agriculture has a digital strategy.
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:41.000]   Two of them.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000]   Yeah, they're trying to--
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.280]   Three of them monitor all the cow poop.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:47.280]   It's all the department of agriculture.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.560]   So that's-- oh, commerce.
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.560]   Commerce has a digital strategy.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.160]   Several.
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:54.440]   Several.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:56.480]   Still commerce.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:59.920]   The Department of Defense at MyPay.gov.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:00.880]   MyPay.gov.
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:02.240]   There is a digital strategy there.
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:02.640]   You can go--
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.000]   MyPay.gov is--
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:04.960]   Go to MyPay.gov.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.760]   You can find out what your pay grade is.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:08.600]   Apparently--
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.760]   We need a digital strategy for this?
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:14.920]   Healthfinder.gov has a digital strategy.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:17.560]   Anyway, it's not looking good.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.480]   The president's going to have to work hard.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:21.400]   He's going to have to get his hands there and do some coding.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.160]   They need a hackathon at the White House.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.280]   That's a good idea, actually.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:25.800]   And--
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:26.360]   It is a good idea.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.440]   MyPay.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.960]   MyPay.com.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:29.840]   Has your email address.
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.280]   This is how you get your money from the--
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.360]   It redirects to MyPay.defast.mil.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.360]   I got to tell you.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:38.520]   That is such an up-to-date.
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:41.000]   I wonder if that's responsive design in that site.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.040]   That looks so up to date.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.840]   And I particularly like the clip art stolen from Facebook
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:45.960]   in the upper right-hand corner.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:48.800]   Does not look like the original Facebook page.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.200]   I'm surprised to say a Mark Zuckerberg production
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:51.720]   at the bottom.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.280]   That does look like it.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.240]   Cellphone plans, according to Randall--
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:57.680]   I love Randall Stevenson, the CEO of AT&T.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.800]   He's just become a--
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.520]   He's a card.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:01.760]   He's a card.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.920]   Cellphone plans could be data only in as short as two years.
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.440]   Hello.
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.640]   So on anyway, right?
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.560]   So you could get a phone with no voice minutes on it.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.000]   Right.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:16.560]   I have one.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.160]   It's called My Old iPhone 3.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.400]   I think a lot of people want that.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.480]   This uses my Wi-Fi.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.400]   I think kids rarely make calls anymore.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.320]   They text each other.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.040]   It'd be all you need.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.240]   They're not even Facebook anymore.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.200]   We have a no-Facebook phone pretty soon, too.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:27.800]   Yeah, we may have--
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.040]   That would be an innovation.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.640]   You could find a no-Facebook, but I agree with that.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.440]   Three gigs.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.320]   It's good for three gigs.
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.200]   You can throw it away.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:34.920]   Oh, wow.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:37.800]   A burner phone that's data only.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.880]   John would use that.
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:41.360]   Finally, might want to tune in.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.280]   I don't know how Tom missed this in his week ahead,
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:44.040]   but Venus is good.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.800]   Well, he's right back to ask him.
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.640]   Tom, did you know that Venus is going to transit
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.920]   the sun on Tuesday?
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:49.680]   No, Dale.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:50.880]   I didn't know that.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:56.000]   It's been a hundred years since it happened,
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]   and it won't happen again for another 105.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:58.400]   Just--
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.640]   So everybody makes sure Tuesday night
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.360]   to stare into the sun at about 6 p.m.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.040]   And look for a little black dot that is where your eyeballs
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:06.560]   are crying.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.920]   This is not what we call a total eclipse.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.040]   It's a dot.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:10.840]   It's a small little dot.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:12.240]   Small dot.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:15.440]   When a 747 flies across the sun, it's better entertainment.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:15.960]   It's better.
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.480]   Venus will fail to eclipse the sun.
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.120]   That's it.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.520]   That's the headline.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.480]   Venus fails to eclipse sun.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:25.120]   We'll try again in a hundred years.
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:28.000]   Doc Serrel's so nice to talk to you again.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.920]   I'd love to get you back more often.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.560]   Doc's new book.
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:34.040]   You know what we do want to do is set up an interview just
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:37.320]   with you for our triangulation show.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.520]   Yeah, we'll show you.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:42.920]   Because I think it's a very interesting--
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:48.160]   the intention economy is a really interesting idea.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.760]   And it's kind of the logical next step after Clue Train.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:57.840]   When customers take charge, it's about time.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:00.720]   Probably one of the best books about what's
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.640]   happening in the digital world and the economy.
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.520]   On Amazon right now.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.120]   Thank you.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.560]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.520]   With the price that changes daily, there it is.
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:10.960]   Does it?
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:13.080]   And depending on what browser you're using,
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:14.280]   what are you getting for a Kindle?
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.600]   $16.20.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.920]   Kindle versions $12.99.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:18.560]   That's OK.
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:20.920]   So the Kindle price has been all over the map.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:21.760]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.040]   You just treat it for browsers.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.280]   Is that your publisher or is that Amazon?
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:25.600]   No, no.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.120]   It's entirely Amazon.
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:27.880]   It's entirely Amazon.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.320]   So are they triangs?
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:29.880]   Like, well--
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.000]   I think they were triangstopping.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.880]   And actually, the Kindle edition was as much as $21 for a while
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:34.920]   on one of my browsers.
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.360]   That's ridiculous.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.080]   But now $12.99 is--
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:39.240]   That's a good price.
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:40.960]   And that's less than the heart cover.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:43.400]   Not much, but it's a little less.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.040]   They're selling it for $16.20, which is a good deal.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:47.520]   I mean, that for--
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:48.320]   Yeah, it is.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:51.080]   By the way, I'm buying it, actually, because I'm running out.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.480]   And that's the cheapest place to buy.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:53.080]   The cheapest place to buy it.
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:54.600]   Amazon has a monopoly now.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:55.520]   I just want you to--
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.520]   It's clear.
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.680]   There is no other bookstore.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.880]   It's the only one that matters.
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.440]   We have still an independent bookstore in town.
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:03.840]   And it's like, why even go there?
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.720]   Because they have a few books.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.720]   I could just buy--
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.720]   Mother's fine.
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:08.720]   Mother's fine.
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:09.720]   Mother's fine.
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:10.720]   Mother's fine.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:11.720]   Mother's fine.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:12.720]   Mother's fine.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:15.560]   I kind of like them where I live is fine.
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:18.720]   You're going to pay full price for that book at Barnes and Noble.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.720]   And they won't have everything.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:20.720]   I mean, that's the problem.
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:21.720]   And they always say, well, I get it.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:22.720]   We can get it for you in a few days.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.720]   I said, I can have it tomorrow.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:25.720]   I feel bad.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:26.720]   I want to support the local book.
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:27.720]   You should.
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:28.720]   I should.
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:29.720]   Why don't you?
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:30.720]   I'll just go buy books I don't really want.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:31.720]   There you go.
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:32.720]   You should.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:33.720]   That's the point.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.720]   That's the point.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.880]   Well, you can give you the Dead Tree edition.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:37.880]   That's it.
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:40.240]   But I wanted it in a Kindle.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.840]   Can you do a look?
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.920]   Rafe Needleman-- you know, it's time.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.600]   You haven't done a report is roundtable in several weeks, and I've been missing it,
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:48.600]   so get to work.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.440]   I've got some cool ones coming up, do you?
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.520]   So, like, what do you mean?
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.560]   Like, the guests are cool, the topics are cool.
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:57.640]   Well, hopefully both.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:01.200]   That makes for a good show when you have both an interesting topic and a good guest.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.200]   I could learn from you.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.600]   Yeah, that's a trick.
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:06.320]   Here we had good guests and nothing to talk about.
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:07.840]   So, yeah.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.640]   But we have four women in the audience.
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:11.840]   Yeah, that's a personal victory.
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:12.840]   It's a new high.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:13.840]   It's a new high.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:16.840]   When I say high, I mean high.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:19.240]   And also, of course, on CNET, where you are, editor at large.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:23.120]   And news.com, I'm doing a lot of writing on mobile and Google and startups and stuff.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:24.120]   That's a good talk.
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:25.120]   That's a good beat.
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:26.120]   That's the best beat.
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.120]   They're fun.
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:28.120]   Yeah, it's a lot of good, very exciting stuff going on.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:31.920]   John C. de Vorac is a channel de Vorac where he does no agenda now twice weekly.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:39.440]   He went to twice weekly, nogenashow.com twice a week, and Thursdays and Sundays.
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:41.240]   You're doing Thursdays too now.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.240]   That's exciting.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:46.240]   Yeah, we started that just recently because of the demand.
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:48.400]   Yeah, I demanded it.
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.720]   You know, we had Adam on the other day.
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.720]   He was really good.
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:51.720]   After what everyone says.
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:52.720]   Yeah, he was very funny.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:54.520]   Yeah, he can be charming.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.000]   He whipped out his gun.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000]   That was exciting.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000]   Did he shoot the gun?
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000]   No.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.480]   Next time I'll have him back, I wanted him to shoot.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:01.480]   Yes.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.840]   He's a handgun that shoots shotgun shots.
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:04.840]   410, I believe.
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:06.840]   What?
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:07.840]   That's nuts.
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.600]   Well, if you want to kill somebody, it's probably a good idea.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.680]   Well, you shouldn't use a handgun unless you want to kill somebody.
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:13.680]   That's always been my motto.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.760]   That's my feeling about the matter.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:21.800]   We do this show 3PM Pacific 6PM Eastern Time on Sunday afternoons, about 2200 UTC if
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.760]   you're outside of the United States.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:27.880]   We do thank all of you in the European Union for shooting down ACTA.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:31.160]   Our president apparently could not do that.
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:35.080]   If you missed the show live, you can always tune in after the fact that at your convenience
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:38.760]   by just downloading the audio or video, it's available at twitch.tv.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.760]   Tom Maren will be back.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:44.040]   Of course, every Monday through Friday, we have our own daily news hour soon moving to
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:46.440]   10 AM Pacific time.
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:49.240]   I should give you a warning that's going to happen July 2nd.
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:51.640]   But right now, still 3PM Pacific 6PM Eastern.
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.720]   But we decided because Buzz out loud is gone, that's the old Buzz out loud time.
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:57.200]   We moved to the Buzz out loud times.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.200]   They're not there.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.200]   They're not using it.
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.200]   So.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.200]   Didn't know that.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:02.200]   They can't.
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.200]   They killed it.
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:04.200]   They were still doing that show.
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:09.120]   No, Molly's moved on to something called Always On.
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:10.120]   Always On.
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:12.520]   In fact, half our staff went to join her.
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:14.080]   I'm not bitter.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.240]   Apparently not.
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:18.000]   Alright, thank you all for joining us.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000]   We'll see you next time.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]   Another Trit is in the camp.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000]   It's amazing.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:30.840]   I'm going to quit.
