[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.840]   This is Twit this weekend tech and a great panel
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.080]   to get today, kind of a different panel.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.720]   One newbie and I'll introduce him first.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.280]   Scott Rosenberg has never been with us before.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.720]   Former print journalist who left the print world
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.200]   to help co-found Salon.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.240]   Gosh, almost more than 10 years ago now.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.480]   Scott, it's amazing.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.520]   Scott, to 12th, 13th, 1995.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.800]   However, how many years is that?
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.280]   I can't count.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.920]   Crazy. And Salon's still going stronger.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920]   In fact, stronger than ever during this election year.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.360]   It's really become a resource during the election year.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.680]   Great information.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.880]   And now is working on a book.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.200]   He wrote Dreaming and Code, which is a great book.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.840]   And now working on a new one about the story
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.400]   of blogging from beginning to end.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.200]   Well, we don't actually know where the end is.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.360]   So for beginning, beginning till the present.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.080]   Middle and wherever we are now.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.000]   That's an interesting job to tackle, I would imagine.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I mean, it's kind of an amorphous subject,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.680]   as I'm sure you find it.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.080]   It starts out somewhat manageable,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.280]   because of course you start with a handful of people.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.880]   And then over time it explodes and becomes this kind of,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.280]   you know, the tidal wave of stuff.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   And at that point, you know, you really have to be very selective
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.120]   and say, what are some key events?
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.560]   What are some key people?
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.040]   And what does it all mean, really?
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.680]   It becomes less about what happened and more about,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.160]   you know, how did all this stuff change the way we live
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.520]   and the way we use the web and so on?
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.200]   Well, this is again an election, it's huge.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.080]   Let me, Harry McCracken is also here.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.000]   Is that you, Harry?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.840]   It was.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.800]   I was wondering if Scott is even attempting to determine
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.400]   who the first blogger was given
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.520]   that I'm not keeping any of those for sure.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.440]   Well, you know, it seems like there are so many claimants
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.480]   to it and that it's kind of goes back at this point.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.560]   The easy way out of that is to just say
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.400]   that the first website that Tim Berners-Lee set up
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.320]   had a reverse chronological list of new websites.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.160]   There you go.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.440]   And that, you know, you can say that.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.920]   That kind of preempts all the other people.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.040]   Also, so that's Harry McCracken of Technologizer,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.840]   another print fugitive, although a little more recent,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.440]   former editor in chief at a PC World Magazine.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.400]   Technologizer is his new, dare I say, blog, Harry?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.120]   I keep wavering back and forth on whether I claim I am a blogger.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120]   I'm not.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.880]   I mean, ultimately it's all just about whether the content
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.040]   is worth reading, but I am in reverse chronological order.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.200]   And I guess if that's the definition of blogging,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.360]   then I am one.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.120]   Yeah, that's a problem.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.720]   I don't know what a blog is anymore.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.520]   I mean, they're all just websites.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.600]   Technologizer, the last time we talked, Harry,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.800]   you hadn't launched it yet.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.680]   It has now launched a smarter take on tech and great stuff.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.480]   Great information.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.960]   Thank you.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.200]   Yeah, I'm really enjoying it.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.800]   I think it's right on.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.640]   I just hope you do well with it because it's a very useful site
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.120]   and really good reading, which is probably the most important thing.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   Things are going well.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.920]   And the best part about doing it is I actually get to do the stuff
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.640]   I got into this business for, which is to touch stuff and use products
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.560]   and to write about them and to start a conversation.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.520]   Right.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   That's the fun stuff.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.080]   Also, with us, Tom Merritt, who is no stranger to Twitter from BuzzOut Loud,
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.200]   Tom, you're not a fugitive from anything.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   I try not to be mostly because I'm not a member of anything.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   There's nothing to flee.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   And I have to then flee from it.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   There's nothing to flee.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   But you have done print.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   You've done television.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   You've done web.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   And now you're doing that.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   I have done Geosities home pages.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   Nothing to be proud of.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   Angelfire.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   I've done BlinkText.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   I've done tripod.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   The top story of the week, I guess, is going to be a story that really breaks on
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   the top.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   The top story of the week, I guess, is going to be a story that really breaks on Tuesday.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.920]   Apple did, in fact, send out the email on Tuesday, as it is want to do, saying, "Come
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.200]   to our event on October."
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   What is it going to be?
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.760]   The 14th.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.960]   And it said, "The spotlight is on notebook."
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.920]   So clearly, this is going to be the announcement of the Macbooks.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.600]   I know, Harry, you've written a little bit about it.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.920]   In fact, you've even got a great post saying, "Let's build an $800 Macbook."
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.600]   And so that's one of the rumors, is that they'll be one that cheap.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.720]   Tom, what do you think Apple's going to announce?
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.840]   For once, they took all the wind out of our sails, right?
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.320]   And put notebooks right there in the--
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   We know.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.480]   In the invitation.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.320]   And then they said, "We'll put the spotlight on notebooks."
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.000]   And so then we caught ourselves going, "What does that mean?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Is it talking about search?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.320]   Like, you know, you should get over-parsed these things."
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.040]   I think I've come out with a refresh line on notebooks.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.440]   You know, we'll see a new Macbook Pro, a new Macbook.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.680]   It's been a while since they really totally revitalized that line.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.240]   The $800 notebook rumor sounds reasonable to me that in these economic times they might
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:55.040]   try to put out a midway point between a cheap notebook and a MacBook.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.800]   The MacBook Air is there portable, but it's way too expensive.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.240]   So maybe it's more of an Asus EPC competitor.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   Who knows?
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.560]   This time around, I think the rumor sites have been very active and probably accurate
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   as well.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.840]   So, three new MacBooks, one of them might be that inexpensive $800 MacBook.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.520]   Two MacBook Pros, one of them, or maybe both, might be the one carved out of a solid brick
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.560]   aluminum, which might as well be solid gold for the all the cost of that'll be.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.920]   And then two new MacBook Airs.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.840]   Harry, is it possible that they're making a brick?
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.840]   Is that--
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.680]   You know, I wish I knew enough about manufacturing processes to have something smart to say.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.080]   I've seen some people who do know about manufacturing saying that actually the brick is not a particularly
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.720]   innovative idea and some of those things are happening already.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.520]   I do know that we know that Steve Jobs hates seams and imperfections.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.640]   And for many, many years, decades even, he's been trying to build computers that look like
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.160]   they're carved out of a solid brick of something.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   So I think the idea would be appealing.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.760]   I hate to not have any buttons from one of them, some things I've read.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.480]   So a screen, just a solid piece of aluminum that somehow--
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.440]   I mean, he once said that the bottoms of Mac laptops look better than the tops of everybody
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.880]   else's computers, which is true.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.480]   They even care about how the battery fits in and whether there are any seams there.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.480]   Right.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.840]   I think it's exactly the kind of thing his ego would fall for.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.840]   I just don't envy anyone having to unveil a new product line in the face of the current
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.360]   news to say, hey, here are a bunch of laptops and some of them are going to be expensive.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.160]   And oh, by the way, have you looked at the Dow today?
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.320]   How do you say here's a $3,100 notebook?
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   Enjoy.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.120]   Although you have to remember that the original iPod was announced right after 9/11 at a
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.720]   top power lower low point.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.640]   And actually, maybe the timing of that was good because it gave us something else to
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.640]   think about.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.080]   Well, and he's not-- well, we don't know yet.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.520]   We're not expecting anything crazy new.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.760]   I know there was the Calcanis interview on CNET UK where he told Nate Langston that they
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.040]   have an HDTV in the works that would have an Apple TV built into it.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   That's completely credible, don't you think?
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.040]   I don't think you'll know.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.040]   I said this time.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.400]   I don't think you'll see that announcement right now because that this is a bad time to
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.640]   hit a whole new product line.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.440]   But refreshing the MacBook last, you kind of have to do that.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   It's the right time to do it.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.000]   Actually, a little earlier this year might have been even better.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.080]   But it's the kind of announcement that if you're going to hear one, I would guess I would expect.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.960]   Harry, was it possible to build an 800 MacBook?
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.360]   I think it's entirely possible.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.200]   I mean, the current MacBook, which sells for $1,100, has been around for about two and
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.000]   a half years.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.320]   And today's $800 computer is what an $1,100 computer was back then.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.600]   So my guess would be you'll see an $800 one, which is roughly comparable.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.080]   The current MacBook, which will open up room in the line for a new aluminum MacBook, which
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:04.680]   is maybe $1,100 or $1,200 plus a revised of the MacBook Pro, which is actually a design,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.200]   which is very comparable to what power books were like in terms of the industrial design
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.040]   five years ago.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.400]   And then maybe a modest update of the MacBook Air, nothing radically different but a new
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   CPU.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.760]   And I do think that Apple, there's always a delta between PCs and Macs in terms of how
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.800]   much RAM and hard drive size and so forth you get a certain price point that Delta has gotten
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.240]   wider lately.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.760]   And I think that if all they do is give people a little more RAM and a little more hard drive
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.040]   space at each price point, it will help.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   And that would in fact be a message, which is kind of consistent with economic challenges
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.840]   if Mac start to sound like better bargains than they are right now.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.640]   Isn't it amazing, Scott, how much attention Apple is able to kind of garner from these?
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.080]   I mean, it's just a notebook.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.800]   Really, it seems like Steve Jobs is maybe the only person ill.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.360]   He certainly gets more attention than President Bush at this point.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.520]   I mean, President Bush.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.520]   Absolutely.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.960]   You know, he's got a press conference, he has addressed to the nation at this point,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.560]   and no one cares.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   You know, I guess in a sense, Steve is sort of an opportunity at this point to just focus
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.360]   the mind on something that people care, you know, people, they have a passion for Apple,
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:24.080]   they have a passion for the product and they don't have to think about this painful reality.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.280]   We've seen a lot of leaked pictures so far.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.200]   I don't know how, you know, their providence or how accurate they are.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.360]   But we've seen a lot of leaked pictures of these and there's some speculation on some
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.520]   sides that maybe because of the position of the ports on these parts, the movement from
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:49.000]   the front to the side of the CD-ROM that maybe this will be a docable Mac book.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.240]   I'm sure Tom Merritt, all the crazies who write to buzz out loud have proposed this,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.240]   right?
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.160]   They certainly have the crazies who visit my chat room and proposes that you might be
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.360]   more, they might make a screen looking that looks like an iMac but has no guts that you
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.280]   slide.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.480]   This doesn't seem on the face of it very, very credible to be honest with you, that you
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.120]   slide the Mac book into like a toaster and then suddenly you've got a desktop.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.600]   Apple tried this before with the duo.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.280]   I don't know if this is really a.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.680]   Yeah, I've heard the dock rumors.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.960]   I've heard the tablet rumors.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.760]   Those are kind of the two far out there, but at least in the ballpark of a notebook.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   Why not a network?
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.360]   Aren't the netbooks the hottest things out there right now?
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.440]   You've got that new Lenovo, you've got the amazing Asus S101, you've got the Dell, everybody's
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.280]   doing these little two pound simple and seems like that's Apple's territory.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.360]   Yeah, I think well, that's why I think that's what the $800 computer will be.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   It'll be their net book because twice as much as the other guys.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   Well, and there you go.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.840]   It fits the pattern.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.280]   Maybe you're right.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.800]   So you think it'll be a net book?
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   Yeah, I do.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.160]   I think the $800 one will be sort of a well, we have the Mac book air as our net book, but
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.600]   for some people it's too expensive and it's too limited.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.400]   And so we know you want ports and we know sometimes you want a CD wrong drive in there.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   So we've got this new whatever they call it at the $800 price point.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.000]   Any surprises you think at all on Tuesday?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.100]   Somebody in our chat room and I thought it was a great rumor and I'd almost like this
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.680]   uploaded to CNN's iReport.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.480]   Somebody in the chat room said Steve Jobs will announce his retirement and future plans for
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.480]   Apple on Tuesday.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   I suspect when that day comes he's not going to do it in front of a room of reporters most
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   likely.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.480]   You think?
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480]   After announcing net books now.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480]   After announcing net books, right?
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   Oh, one more thing.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480]   I'm out of here.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   That's the one more thing.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   Oh God.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.200]   I don't know what Scott was just saying.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.320]   He's people may pay more attention to Apple than President Bush.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.480]   Maybe he'll announce a run for the presidency.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   Yeah, I would put it past Steve.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.280]   It's the kind of thing he might consider.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.160]   Let's combine those rumors.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.080]   He would have to reveal his full health records though.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.080]   Yep.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   Don, no, you're right.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.920]   He could get that doctor who checked out McCain.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   That's true.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.920]   The guy who didn't.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.920]   He just said.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   McCain actually hasn't revealed his full health record.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.920]   So you can do it.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.320]   You can get away with it.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.320]   What do we do?
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.240]   Apple rumor sites lately have gotten to be better about actually about figuring out almost
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.400]   everything a little early.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.920]   I think it's probably the last time that anything was strikingly new and unreported where the
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.720]   details about the iPhone, which was almost two years ago.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.360]   And even then, everybody knew there would be an iPhone, but they did manage to keep.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:36.800]   But don't you think that gets under Steve's skin and that he will find ways to, you know,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.480]   he'll just do something to spite those sites.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.960]   He'll find things, you know, if not this time next time sooner or later, he's going to
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   stick it to them.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   I'd love to think so.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.280]   I mean, you kind of wonder whether at some point Apple might release false rumors just
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   to get people excited about the wrong thing.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.480]   I'm not sure he hasn't done that already here or there because around the time of the iPhone,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.360]   there were some pretty cool looking pictures that got out and then there were some fake
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.680]   stuff and it was hard to tell truth for rumor and it ended up that there were so many rumors
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.240]   that even if some of them were true, it was hard to tell which ones had been right.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.160]   Nicholas C.R.L.A.L.A., the guy who started Think Secret and was hounded out of business
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:25.920]   by Apple and Apple's lawyers a couple of weeks ago did a survey of Mac rumor sites and he
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:32.480]   said the consensus is that no Apple hasn't been fighting leaks this year.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.600]   He said nobody's received a letter from Apple.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.800]   Nobody's gotten in trouble.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.440]   There's no doubt he says that Apple has changed.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.200]   He says Jeremy Horowitz, editor in chief of iLange, told me in an email probably due to
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.040]   the awful PR, its prior lawsuits generated him because cease and desist letters only
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.680]   confirm links.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.600]   Apple has wisely stopped going after the people who generate its buzz.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.720]   That would be a real change.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.240]   Maybe that part of the campus that had the fire was the department that went after rumors.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.720]   That's where the lawyers were.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.400]   Oh, we don't have a desk.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.760]   Oh, well, that's enough of that.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.760]   I forget it.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   Let the rumors fly.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.040]   It's certainly true that when Apple tells you to take down photos you've put up on your
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.280]   rumor site that has the closest thing to an absolute confirmation.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   It's probably solved a feeding.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.480]   Apple's got so much mileage though out of this, uh, secrecy, this penchant for secrecy.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.640]   It really has amped up the interest in what they're going to announce.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.560]   But I think, I think we're finding it's kind of, it's a little hard for us to even whip
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.160]   up any excitement over this.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.760]   So we'll just, we'll just leave the matter and wait till Tuesday.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.760]   We'll be covering it live.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:43.040]   I'm going to go down there with a camera, a camera crew of one and, uh, and we'll cover
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.040]   it.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.680]   And usually when they do these events at one infinite loop, they have a little demo room
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.200]   next door that you can go to.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.400]   They say the last few times they've done that and see the products.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   I'm hoping they'll do that.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.560]   And if they can, we'll stream live video of that.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.520]   What is the quality of announcement of a, uh, of a one infinite loop versus a Moscone
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.520]   center?
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.160]   Well, that's in that interesting Moscone center.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.360]   That was the last one was the big iPod announcement.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.040]   Although the, the original iPod announcement was at one infinite loop.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.200]   And the last one infinite loop that I can remember, and I think I might be missing one
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.000]   though, it was, that was the high-fi.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.640]   That was stupid.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:24.360]   And the sock, the special, an apple iPod case that was really just a sock.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360]   And it came in colors.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.320]   That was the silliest announcement ever.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.760]   But that was one where you did it.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.120]   In fact, remember they had, they really wear elaborate.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:38.080]   They had different rooms of the house, like a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.320]   and then, and a, and a students, you know, room with bunk beds and each one would have
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.480]   the apple high-fi in it.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.920]   It was a really silly, I don't know if they'll do that this time, but, but it is true that
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.480]   they're not going to go get, go up to Moscone.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.240]   They're going to do it at this much smaller venue.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.120]   So Richard Garriett, Lord, he's Lord British, right?
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.680]   He's in space right now as we speak.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.200]   No toilet with that.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:11.160]   There's no, on Sunday about three in the morning, he was blasted off in a Soyuz TMA-13 capsule,
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:17.800]   which by the way, shows amazing bravery to go up in a Soviet era rocket alongside US
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.920]   astronaut Michael Fink and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Lanka golf.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.160]   They will circle the earth a few times before docking with the International Space Station.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:32.040]   He will at that time conduct this is according to Gizmodo, a series of experiments.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:38.440]   I don't know what, but he said they say they will probably not include level grinding.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.400]   Although level grinding in space might produce a smoother, finer character in the law.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.320]   How does tabula rosa work in space?
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.560]   Exactly.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.760]   The apparently that 19 million dollar toilet isn't really working.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.680]   I bet the latency up there is horrible to.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.040]   This is he's a space tourist, right?
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.360]   How much does it cost to do this?
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.800]   Like a million bucks?
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.200]   I think it's more like 20 million.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.560]   I interviewed Charles Simone because he did this too.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   From Microsoft.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.760]   He's doing a second time.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.320]   He liked it so much.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.200]   I'm pretty sure that the figure was somewhere something like 20, 24 million.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.840]   It was cheap.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.800]   I guess this is more money in role-playing adventures than I thought.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.840]   According to AFP 30 million.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   Wow.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.840]   It's gone up since Simone.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.440]   Wow.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.440]   Space tourism.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.840]   Richard Garriott's dad was an astronaut.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   Really?
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.280]   Maybe he was able to wrangle a discount of some sort.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.520]   I didn't know that.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.480]   He wanted to do what his dad had done.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.600]   That's kind of neat.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   That's the ultimate adventure.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.080]   You think you'll write maybe a sci-fi adventure based on space?
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.640]   I think that's pretty cool.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.080]   One of ours is up there.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.040]   He's dad went up on Skylab back in 1973.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   I didn't know that.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.040]   Was his name Garriott also?
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   Oh, I'm Garriott.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.040]   Oh, I'm Garriott.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.200]   I'll be gone.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.960]   So he's essentially donating money to the development of a space group.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.960]   Good for him.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.720]   I mean, some people complain like, "Oh, he could be doing so much more with this money
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.880]   than just wasting it on a trip into space."
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.360]   But they're essentially letting him do it to fund the continuation of their program.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   That's okay.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.760]   And 30 million probably isn't much.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.000]   That's probably one tank of fuel.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.960]   So the new Google sat, which is not the G-O-I-1 is up and we're seeing the first image from
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.400]   it, a bird's eye view of cut-down university in Pennsylvania.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.120]   It is the world's highest resolution commercial satellite.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.160]   Google among other users for its Google Maps.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.960]   Boy, the picture looks amazing.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.840]   It is really crystal clear.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.960]   Looks like an aerial photo from a plane.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   What's that guy reading there?
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.560]   It looks like the onion, actually.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.960]   I can't quite tell.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.880]   G-O-I-1 has a big Google sticker on it, but actually its main customer is the National
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.760]   Geospatial Intelligence Agency.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.120]   So it is kind of a national security satellite.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.080]   But Google is going to buy the images from it.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.040]   It'll be part of Google Maps.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.480]   I think they have exclusive rights to them, right?
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.760]   Do they have commercial rights, non-spy rights?
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:22.240]   Yeah, they get any of the 50 centimeter images and then I think it can do as good as 41 centimeter,
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.200]   but those are off limits for public use.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.400]   What is that when they say centimeters?
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.480]   I mean, the resolution, the--
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.760]   Each pixel, I just learned this from a Buzz Out Loud listener this week.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.600]   Each pixel represents 41 centimeters in 41 centimeter resolution.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   OK.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.400]   41 cents, two feet, right?
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.720]   Something like that.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   So 41 cents.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   Some close.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   So--
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.360]   100 centimeters.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.600]   You couldn't read a newspaper.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.360]   You might be able to read a license plate.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   You could read a billboard.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.520]   The main thing is they just look--
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.280]   The image really looks nice.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.880]   I mean, it's just-- it's a-- it looks crisper.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.560]   You know, it's like they have better lenses or something on that thing.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.600]   Google's 10th anniversary was last month.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.400]   And you know, the Google phone is coming out in a week.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.760]   They're really becoming almost an extra national institution
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.880]   with their own spy satellite.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.560]   Seriously, an NGO.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.360]   They're an NGO.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.720]   They're really-- I don't know.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.760]   Are you-- does that bother anybody?
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.080]   Scott Rosenberg, do you have your eye on Google while it has its eye on you?
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:38.560]   Yeah, I think we should all-- it behooves all of us to be a little cautious, a little
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.240]   concerned.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:47.840]   I mean, the motto, don't be evil, has all of this kind of--
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.360]   it makes people feel good.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.720]   People love Google because the homepage is clean.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.360]   And they don't throw lousy pop-up ads in your face.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.760]   And all these-- they've got all this goodwill.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:05.000]   But all the goodwill in the world doesn't really matter when someone has a huge amount
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.600]   of power.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.720]   And you don't have any transparency on it.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.600]   I mean, Google remains an incredibly closed institution.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.960]   Ask, you know, I mean, all the people who have beeps with their advertising system.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.440]   It's really hard to kind of deal with them.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.360]   Google is, you know, all set up to have machines talk to machines.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.480]   And that works great for them.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.360]   But it's not a very, you know, sort of people talking to people kind of a company.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.960]   So I think caution is definitely called for.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.040]   So witness the flap we had over getting their privacy policy linked from the front page.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   Right.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   It took--
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.440]   They seem above the law.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.720]   You know, we don't have to do that, even though the state of California says so.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.560]   And then they finally begrudgingly figured out how to drop one word to another page so
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.800]   they could make room for the privacy word and link that right next to the copyright
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   now.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.040]   Well, at least they're not listening in on our phone sex.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.640]   They're leaving that to the NSA.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.640]   Not yet.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   Maybe they are.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   We just don't know about it.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   They'll allow you to search it.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.120]   They just don't listen.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:16.440]   A Navy linguist David Murphy Fock, Intercept Operator, said that Intercept operators shared
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:22.960]   a number of titillating conversations while eavesdropping at the NSA on phone calls made
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.520]   by US military personnel.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.200]   He told ABC, "There's good phone sex or there's some pillow talk.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   Pull it up.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   It's really funny."
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.680]   Now, this isn't the enquirer.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.680]   But it's actually from--
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   Is it from Biaxot?
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:45.160]   It's from the new book by James Bamford, who is the world's greatest expert on the NSA.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.560]   His first book was called The Puzzle Palace.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.560]   It came out like 20, 30 years ago.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.560]   Remember that?
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.400]   It revealed the-- you know, it exposed the NSA to the world.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.320]   And he is an amazing writer and researcher.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.640]   I haven't read the book yet.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.920]   His new book is called The Shadow Factory.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.160]   And this detail is from it, although the enquirer did not mention that.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.160]   No.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.120]   Although, and the Senate, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says he's going to
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.600]   investigate these allegations.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.600]   So they took it seriously.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.280]   But it should be-- I think given that Bamford is the source, it should be taken seriously.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.800]   And I am not-- I can't say having read his first book that I'm surprised.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.200]   It's the least surprising thing in the world.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.160]   It would have been amazing if stuff like this didn't happen.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.080]   It's the flippancy of the quote that really gets you.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.960]   I mean, folks says, there's good phone sex or there's some pillow talk.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   Pull it up.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   It's really funny.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   It's good.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.640]   Shadow Factory comes out next week, by the way.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.440]   So that might end up being our audible pick when that comes out on audio.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.640]   I'd love to listen to that.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.640]   I mean, listening to legacy of ashes right now.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.720]   And it's really kind of mind-boggling to hear what these government agencies are doing
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.080]   in the name of security.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.120]   But of course, they're doing that.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.920]   You get some young guys.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   I don't care if they have a security clearance.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   They're going to do that.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.840]   You know, there's something hot going on.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.400]   Hail is this.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.840]   You all believe it.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.360]   All right, no harm, right?
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.440]   You know, you just listened it in for a little bit of fun.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.440]   It's a little creepy.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.040]   It's real creepy.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.800]   It's the kind of thing you assume goes on logically.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.000]   But then somewhere in the back of your mind, you're like, oh, but it can't be really.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   But yeah, yeah, it really does.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It is.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.960]   It's why you need courts to have some kind of oversight over this stuff and why that,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   you know, that battle is still really important.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.760]   The Fysa court or somebody though, because you got to keep it secret still, right?
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.080]   You can't let everybody know what the NSA is up to or it loses some of its potency.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.000]   Fine, but at least the Fysa court.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   At least Fysa, yeah.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.640]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.120]   As long as I mentioned, Audible, I want to actually talk about some new book that Audible
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.960]   is allowing you guys to download free.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.360]   It is a special exclusive to Twit listeners.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.360]   And I am really excited.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.440]   I've been listening to it all week secretly.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   It's called Meta-Tropolis.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.400]   Let me tell you a little bit about audible.com first.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:07.440]   Audible is, of course, the premier source of audio recordings, books, lectures, debates,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.600]   speeches.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   I love Audible 51,000 titles and counting.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.320]   And now they're doing a lot of exclusive stuff.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.480]   This is the new sci-fi book that Audible commissioned.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.160]   It's called Meta-Tropolis.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.560]   I love the idea.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.640]   They took five of the top sci-fi authors in the world, Jay Lake, Michael Hogan, Tobias
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   Buckhall.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.440]   Actually, those are the narrators.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.480]   I'm giving you the guys.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.560]   The authors are John Scalsy who edited the piece as well.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.760]   Elizabeth Bear, Jay Lake, Tobias Buckhall, Carl Schroeder.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.880]   And the idea was all these guys got together first and gals, got together first to create
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:51.280]   a new world, a kind of a dystopia in the near future called Meta-Tropolis, a world where
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.880]   the big cities are dying or transformed.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.360]   And the suburbs are now the treacherous wilds.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.240]   It's actually a really timely book.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.440]   I'm reading the first, and then they wrote five novellas around this world.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.040]   So they're not collaborating.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.520]   They only collaborated in the creation of the world.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.400]   And then they said, "Okay, now go out and I write a novella on it."
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.720]   And they went out and they got narrators from Battlestar Galactica to read it.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   And I'm reading the first one.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.560]   We're going to give it to you free.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.960]   Saltag of Battlestar Galactical, Michael Hogan reads the first one in the forest of the night
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.520]   written by Jay Lake.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.880]   I'm going to play a little bit of it for you.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.080]   It is so good.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:44.000]   I invite you to go to our special URL, audible.com/twitmedda, T-W-I-T-M-E-T-A.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.440]   And you're going to be able to download the first story absolutely free.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.520]   You don't have to have a credit card.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.960]   No geographic restrictions.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   We listen to you.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.040]   And I know some people were upset that some of the books we talk about aren't available
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.040]   worldwide.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.800]   This is available worldwide.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.160]   Whether you're an existing customer, a new customer, or no customer at all, all you need
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.320]   to do is submit your email address and create a password, no credit card.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.640]   So you're going to go to audible.com/twitmedda.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.440]   And I'm going to play a little bit of the saltag reading this.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.040]   I tell you, I'm loving this book.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   You're going to like it, Tom.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.200]   It might be something for a sword and laser.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.840]   I don't think there's a print version of it.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.480]   I think it's only for audible.com.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.600]   Let me see if I can find the-- this is from the first story.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.720]   It would be nice to say that Tiger arrived in Cascadia,opolis on the wings of a storm.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:44.080]   Riding the boiling front of electric darkness and lashing rain like a tall, handsome man
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:50.200]   out of some John Ford Western, or that he came through shadow and fire by a secret tunnel
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.080]   through the honeycomb to basalt bones of these green-covered mountains.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.840]   A hero out of temple legend following the journey of the gods.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.720]   It would be nice, but inaccurate.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:09.800]   Tiger arrived the way almost everyone comes to Cascadia,opolis, either by accident, by
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:16.040]   judicial design, or by following the damp silences between the trees higher and higher
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.560]   until there was nowhere left to go.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.400]   Cascadia,opolis is in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.400]   It's a green community created by-- I just love it.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.920]   Just follow the damp silences till you see the yellow spaces.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.920]   Take a right.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.000]   Michael Hogan's reading that one, Colonel Saul Tague, Candice McClure, Officer Anastasia
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.920]   D. Dudwala on the battle-stargolactic also reads one.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:48.520]   Stephanie Riddnicki and Scott Brick, two of their best narrators from Audible, and Alessandro
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.120]   Giuliani, who is Lieutenant Felix Geita.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.960]   That was really kind of distracting, actually, to hear Colonel Tague.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   No.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   You know what?
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.400]   He is the old man wouldn't put up with this.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.480]   He's really good on this book.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.440]   Just take my word for it.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.440]   "Twit-meta" is the key word.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.560]   So go to audible.com/twit-meta and download it, and I think you'll get hooked.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.520]   I'm not sure how soon the full book is available.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.440]   You could pre-order it now, but you will be able to hear the first novella from it.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.440]   Jay Lake wrote this.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.000]   I have not read any Jay Lake stories, and I'm going to read more.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.800]   He is really good.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:30.400]   By the way, it's political.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:37.120]   It's really kind of the aftermath of the great economic upheaval and destruction of
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   the American economy.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.120]   I just loved it.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.800]   October 21st, the book comes out.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.000]   So you're going to get a preview.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   This is exclusive, by the way.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.440]   We're not promoting this anywhere else.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.360]   Audible is not promoting it anywhere else.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.160]   They want to see if there's anybody listening.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.240]   Audible.com/twit-meta.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.640]   If the site hasn't gone down, go there right now because I think there are a few bullets
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   people listening.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.520]   It is really good.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.480]   And we thank Audible for their support of this week in tech.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.840]   So maybe the NSA would get them to stop listening to the phone calls and start listening to
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.840]   more audiobooks.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.520]   "Court has banned the sales of real DVD.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:19.040]   This is a real network's attempt to make a DVD ripping program that was legal."
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.560]   Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, remember her from Napster?
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.280]   Is it ruled that a temporary restraining order blocking sales of the software will stay
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.600]   placed indefinitely until she figures out whether it violates the DMCA?
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.800]   The story just kills me.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:39.000]   Right now you can go to download.com or freaking Google, search for DVD ripping stuff.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.440]   We can find hundreds of titles.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.560]   There's a great one called Mac Drive-In that does exactly the same thing.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   But that's fine.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.560]   We can allow those.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   But this is real networks.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.760]   And they better not do that.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.160]   And when real networks comes and tries to do it with added protection and efforts to try
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.880]   to get licensing and cooperate, then they get slammed down and thrown in a goal.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.360]   Is it because the movie industry has to do this?
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   No.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.080]   Well, if they had to do it, why wouldn't they do it with all these other programs?
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.360]   Because they're off shore.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.760]   They can't find these guys.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.800]   Yeah, they're not companies that are legal targets the way a real company, pardon the pun,
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   like real is.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:22.000]   And real tried to play the game by the law and I think it's real real shame.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   No pun intended.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.520]   They went, didn't Rob Glazier go to the movie industry?
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.320]   And so we're going to make this work.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   What do you think?
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   They're hoping.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   They've been in a program.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.320]   I just lost two ones because of.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   Sorry.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.160]   They're hoping that Hollywood would say maybe we can sell, you know, if somebody rips their
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:44.600]   copy of the Godfather Part 1, maybe we can sell them Part 2 and Part 3 through real DVD.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.840]   But real ended up suing Hollywood preemptively.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   The day the software came out and then Hollywood sued them later this the same day.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.440]   And I think it's kind of a shame because this is, actually it's a pretty good product,
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.360]   but it's also a product which is inherently crippled to please Hollywood.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.240]   Once you've burned, once you've ripped a movie onto a hard drive, you cannot move that
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.680]   to another hard drive.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.160]   You can't put these things on your home network, let alone on bit torrent and even that wasn't
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.560]   enough to satisfy Hollywood.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.440]   So the point of this is that people want to get their DVDs on their computer so they
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.640]   can fly somewhere so that they can, it's just more convenient.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.840]   Hollywood said, well, the problem with this is you could rent a movie, rip it and then
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.720]   bring the movie back.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.160]   Can they do that, Harry?
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.160]   You could do that.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.120]   I mean, there would be nothing preventing you from doing that.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.560]   So I guess that's a loophole I can understand they may not.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:42.120]   It's a loophole, but if you fix every loophole, if you wait until every loophole has been eradicated,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.600]   nothing will ever happen and you would think that Hollywood would want all these people
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.360]   and all these DVDs to jump into the digital age a little more quickly.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.760]   Why doesn't an executive sitting in one of these buildings in Hollywood say, well, wait
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.720]   a minute, as you pointed out, it's easy to do this illegally.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.720]   It's trivial.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.720]   Anybody can do it.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.200]   It's like, and they finally are getting that with MP3s.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:10.880]   They tried to kill the MP3 and today you can go to Amazon and buy, you know, on unlocked
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   MP3s.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.920]   Unlocked songs, what you could immediately turn around.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.120]   Has that put the music industry out of business?
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:21.240]   No, it's one of the few pieces of brightness there is out there for the music industry.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   And I don't know.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.560]   I mean, I'm looking at Flip for Mac's website.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.520]   They make the drive in software that I just mentioned.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.160]   They have their company addressed right there.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.080]   Oh, Flip for Mac's illegitimate company.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.520]   Tell us streaming Nevada City, California.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.360]   They're doing exactly the same piece of software as real.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.600]   Just runs on a Mac.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   No trouble.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.760]   Well, mate, well, now they're in trouble.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.640]   You busted them, dude.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.440]   I forgot about that drive in program.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.040]   That's not like shrink to five or anything.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.960]   No, it's on a fly by night thing.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.440]   That's a legit program.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.200]   This is a big company.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:00.240]   So their drive in allows you to take a DVD, put it in the drive, rip it to your hard drive
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.240]   and watch it.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.280]   It's a bit doing the same thing as real.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.600]   It's doing bit for bit copy.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.400]   And then I think it even encrypts that copy so that you can't, you know, you're limited
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.440]   with what you can do with it.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:16.160]   It's following all the rules of the, oh, what was the case that was won as like a while
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.160]   back, kaleid escape.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.360]   Oh, this is the DVD jukebox.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.360]   Where they.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.960]   It's a very similar acceptor costs like $30,000 or $40,000.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.600]   And the court said it wasn't the record.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.800]   It wasn't the movie industry that said, okay, it was the courts that said it's okay.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.080]   So the idea was you've got a button.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.360]   You got 300 DVDs or whatever.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.600]   You put them in this jukebox.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.800]   It copies them to the hard drive.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   Now you take the DVDs out and you can watch it on the jukebox.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.760]   Although that they never ruled on whether that was a violation of copyright laws.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.280]   It had to do with the licensing agreements that the glide escape people had with Hollywood
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.800]   on the DVD encryption software.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:58.680]   You have to, you have to, uh, protect a movie to play it.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.240]   Every DVD player can do that.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   Right.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.040]   Every DVD player program can do that on your computer, but they do that by license with
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   Hollywood.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.040]   Mm hmm.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   That's right.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.680]   I mean, if you couldn't decrypt this stuff, then nobody could ever watch it in any form.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.680]   Right.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.280]   And the glide escape people had a license to do that.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.800]   And I assume real did too.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   And with glide escape, it was proven that if what glide escape was doing, which is very
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:25.520]   similar to real DVD, was not a violation of the license they had, but the court did not
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.480]   say, okay, this is not a violation of copyright law.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.480]   Right.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.440]   And that's what this judge is saying is I have to decide if this circumfence the DMCA.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.400]   And that's a really key question here because you're not cracking the encryption.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.720]   You're doing a bit for bit.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:44.760]   And if doing that violates the DMCA, that means pretty much anytime you make a copy of
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.920]   something that someone attempted to copy, protect, you're violating the DMCA.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.760]   And the real copy is a good.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.680]   Which sort of is what the DMCA says, doesn't it?
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.760]   I mean, they don't believe in fair use.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.880]   Yeah, there's no exemption for fair use in the DMCA.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:05.080]   And that would be a fair use application, making a copy of something you already own for backup
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.000]   purposes would be fair use.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.280]   It should be, but the DMCA doesn't.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.600]   There is no fair use.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.320]   I think it is fair use, but it still violates the DMCA.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   Right.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   The DMCA doesn't allow for fair use.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.800]   Yeah, there's no, and we're actually on Buzz out, we're trying to get a couple of people
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.600]   who are patent lawyers in the office audience to submit fair use as a proposed exemption
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.880]   to the DMCA to the Library of Congress, because they're taking suggestions right now.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   Oh, good.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   So that's good.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   I'd like to support that.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   Go to BOL.CNET.com.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.320]   Yeah, go to the forums forums.cNET.com.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.040]   Look for Frank Latuca's posting about it.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.760]   That's where he's trying to get it together.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   Good.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   Good.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.080]   I mean, that's the kind of thing that might make a difference.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.000]   Just little grassroots.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   You never know.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.160]   I mean, the chances of them accepting it as an exemption are pretty slim, but it's worth
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.160]   a shot.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.000]   Well, you got to figure and it's terrible, but it's probably true.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.040]   You got to figure that the copyright boy, royalty boy, just before they see that.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   Okay, good.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.600]   Let me just call my friend at Universal and see what he thinks.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.600]   You got to figure they do that, right?
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.520]   It's possible.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.080]   Let's just see what the MPAA says before we rule.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.360]   We don't want to make any mistakes.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:28.360]   A Russian security firm, ElcomSoft, says, "We can now use NVIDIA video cards in PCs to
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.560]   speed up the cracking of WPA keys."
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.960]   This is the encryption used on wireless networking.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.520]   Thought to be uncrackable.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.440]   We could speed it up 100 times faster.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.160]   Fast enough that we think that in most cases we could brute force your WPAK and it's a matter
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.480]   of days.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:51.520]   Now, I think this is just ElcomSoft's trying to sell software here.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.760]   They're proclaiming it's the depth of wireless networking and business networks.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   I guess that would be true.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.000]   If you were a general motors and you were worried about Toyota doing industrial espionage, there
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.560]   would be some incentive to sit outside company headquarters, download a bunch of data and
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.480]   spend a week or two cracking it, but nobody's going to do that to your home Wi-Fi.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:18.960]   Isn't it a legal problem now for a decent sized company where now that they've said
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.760]   that this can be cracked?
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:26.480]   Even if it's a dubious claim or debatable, their lawyers are going to say, "Well, we
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.720]   have to disclose this as a risk.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.160]   This is not a good..."
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:39.720]   As you do your review of your security procedures and so forth, you're going to have to say
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.000]   your shareholders, "This is a problem."
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   I see.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.840]   Well, that would make sense.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.440]   It's one of those little fudge disclaimers you got to put at the bottom of the thing.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:59.000]   We should point out that a brute force attack is still going to take a long time, even if
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.720]   it's 100 times faster.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.840]   It's still going to take a long time if you have a truly random password.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   The real problem is people don't use random passwords.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.360]   They use short, non-random passwords.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.880]   That's a lot easier to brute force.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.440]   I think any business that's using Wi-Fi ought to be forcing anyone on the network to be using
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.880]   VPN as well, just to be safe.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:28.600]   Even before they cracked WPA, I would never have relied on wireless for security.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.760]   Well, let me do a little calculator.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.280]   This is LastBit.com as a password length calculator.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:38.680]   How long is your WPA password, Tom?
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.360]   I'm somewhere in the 20s, I think.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.440]   Oh, well, I'll just say 15.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.440]   Sure.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.400]   And we'll say that this brute force calculator, let's give it, let's say it could do half
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.240]   a million passwords a second.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.840]   They said now they can use 100 computers at a time.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.520]   Let's just calculate how long it's going to take.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:00.880]   Oh, it's going to take 1,078,485 years.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.240]   I guess you're safe.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.480]   If you have enough time, I guess you're safe.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.440]   Well, this is AES encryption on WPA, right?
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.440]   We're not talking about WAP.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.440]   No, this is strong encryption.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.640]   I mean, the only way to crack it is by trying one after another.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.760]   The way they do this is you download a bunch of, you have to download the data.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.520]   You can't sit out front of somebody's house and do this.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.760]   You have to download enough data and then you have to kind of brute force it using many,
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.120]   many, many, the NSA maybe could do this.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.720]   We should ask that guy.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.000]   Any encryption given enough time is crackable.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Right.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   I've been given enough time.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.200]   You've got a billion years.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.960]   I think you're probably right, Scott.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.440]   It's probably a corporate Weasel word thing, but Elcomsoft probably should get a little
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.080]   ding for scaring people with something that really isn't that scary.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:57.280]   A hundred times faster is not nearly fast enough.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:05.360]   On the other hand, according to Gizmodo, a computer named Elbot has managed to achieve
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.720]   a 25% success rate in the Turing test, convincing a human being that they're talking to another
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.080]   human being and is hosting the show today in place of.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.920]   I am Elbot.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.680]   Fold ya.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:25.800]   I don't know if 25% success is really going to knock me out, but apparently this is a
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   lot more than ever before.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   Well, you need what?
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   Thirty to pass the Turing test.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Thirty.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.560]   I think they must have used dumber humans for this test.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   They're still unreleased.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   I've got to call about it.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.680]   That's a very good point.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.960]   It seems like it's so easy to just spring a question on a computer or try to make the
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   computer laugh.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.560]   It's a good point.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.680]   So you have a panel of people who had a blind test talking to do you have to have to talk
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.760]   to a human and a computer to do this?
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.240]   I think the classical one is just you're talking to somebody and you don't know whether it's
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.520]   a computer or not and if the computer fools you, then it's best the test.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.560]   I don't remember Turing say that 30% was enough of a success rate.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.080]   I thought he made it more binary for that.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.680]   You either do it or you don't.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   I'm not going to get that.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:18.280]   Often these tests are conducted by IAM or typing where the laughter possibility isn't
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.480]   really an issue.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:27.800]   It's more just and even with that kind of handicap, in the past at least it's certainly always
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.320]   been pretty easy to figure out.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.640]   What was the one they used to have called?
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.640]   Was it Ethel?
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   Eliza.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   Eliza.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.640]   Eliza.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.640]   That's what I'm checking out.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   How are you today?
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   I don't know.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   How are you?
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.640]   I mean they have come a long way since Eliza.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   I am fine.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.640]   Fine.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.080]   I don't know anything about piss off.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:53.600]   The thing about Eliza was that it was surprisingly effective, even crude as it was.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:59.440]   If you had the slightest suggestion to the person who, the human being at the other end,
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.480]   that if you told them in advance that they're talking to a human being, they wanted to believe
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.920]   that and they actually were willing to buy that this was another person.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:13.640]   Well, more than that, that's why Eliza was a psychotherapist because then you could say,
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.080]   the reason she's keeping repeating what I'm saying is because she's...
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   That's what therapists do.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.520]   That's what they get paid for.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.960]   That's how they work.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.480]   She's trying to get in my mind.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.160]   Yeah, in fact if you compared to Eliza to psychotherapists, Eliza did pass the Turing
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.520]   test, I think.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.520]   Freudian only.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:36.800]   Remember that there was a Santa Claus, this was last Christmas, something like that.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:44.240]   Microsoft had a Santa bot, I dimly remember this on its MSN mail, and after a while it
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.160]   started inviting you over to his house, it kind of had some got racy.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   How old are you?
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.160]   Would you like to come over to my place?
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.000]   They shut that one down pretty quick.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Santa learns fast.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.760]   It's amazing what artificial intelligence, where it goes.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.000]   Speaking of artificial intelligence, I'm going to get in trouble for that.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.520]   Sarah Palin has to save her emails because they were used for state business.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:17.240]   Now this kid, this Tennessee kid who's the son of a Tennessee state legislator, used
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.520]   basically social engineering techniques to break into her Yahoo mail.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.520]   What was it?
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.520]   AlaskaGov@yahoo.com.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.800]   Apparently they had set up email accounts known only to each other.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.480]   That's a violation.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:34.400]   The Washington Post says that Sarah Palin maintained a private email account that she
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.560]   communicated with a small circle of staff members outside the government's secure official
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.920]   email.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.000]   And now courts are saying that she has to preserve all this email.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   This is...
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Well, the kid in Tennessee's got them all for us, so...
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Yeah, he's good.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   He got indicted.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.920]   Apparently, it's not the first time this kid in middle school hacked into a school computer.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.720]   So there.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.720]   Watch out.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   He's an hacker.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.720]   Shocking.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.880]   And that's got to be embarrassing to the legislator though.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.000]   And he didn't do anything particularly brilliant.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   I mean, things like...
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Oh, was there a state name?
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Or so easy to find.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.680]   It's just got a shocking.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.160]   It's taken this long for people to figure out that none of this stuff is secure in the
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   least.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.160]   You know...
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.160]   Was it just a dictionary attack on her?
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.160]   No.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.160]   He just guessed.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.160]   He just gay socially engineered it.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.520]   The secret questions were, where did you meet your husband?
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   Oh, he got the secret questions.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   That's right.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.120]   So he wrote Wasela High School.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.880]   Actually, he tried Wasela High School.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.880]   That didn't work.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.880]   So he tried Wasela High.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   Yep, bingo.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:39.360]   It's like when Paris Hilton got her sidekick hacked.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.200]   Remember the secret question is, what's the name of your dog?
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.760]   Which she of course, everybody knew because she was on TV with the dog.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   Don't use...
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   You know, my answer is lie.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.000]   When they ask you the secret questions, lie.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.240]   Yeah, you have to have an alternate identity that no one but you knows about.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.040]   With a back story.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.040]   You got to remember it though.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.040]   Because yeah, you got to have a whole back story.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.400]   So you got to remember it because they're going to ask you, where'd you go to high school?
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   Muncie.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   Quickly.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.000]   Or saw Indiana.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.480]   But you know, I remember, I think it was Bill Clinton who said I don't use email.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.440]   I know President Bush doesn't use email.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.800]   He doesn't, for instance, email his daughters.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   Not because he doesn't...
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.920]   But Carl Rove got into this problem in the White House.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.120]   Yeah, because not because he doesn't know how to use email, but because this is public
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.960]   record.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.440]   So they keep trying this dodge of, oh, I'll set up a private account.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.320]   No one will know and no one will ever find out.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.880]   And that is, you know, where are they getting into trouble over and over again.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.120]   Yeah, that's ignorance of how the internet works.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.360]   I mean, I think a lot of people who listen to this show know that you never really want
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.240]   to put anything in email that you wouldn't be able to handle getting out sometime.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.600]   Are you not allowed to have a...
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.960]   She is not allowed to have a private email?
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.480]   Well, I mean, I'm just talking practically just having an email account.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:59.120]   Even if you think you deleted it and shut it down, email has a way of finding its way
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.960]   into dark corners of the internet that you had no idea existed and then popping up at
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.960]   the most inopportune times.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.360]   So far as with the legality of having a private email, I guess she's not allowed...
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:12.760]   The governor of Alaska is not allowed to conduct official business outside of the official
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   channels.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   Is that what's going on there?
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.920]   Yeah, it's true in California I served on a committee in our local town.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.400]   And there's this thing called the Brown Act.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.480]   And you're not allowed to have...
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.400]   You can't even have correspondence with other members.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.720]   It actually is extraordinarily frustrating.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   It was a tech committee.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.760]   We were not allowed to set up a forum, exchange private emails because the rules are against
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.240]   meeting in private essentially.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.000]   Anything you do has to be public.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.280]   And I'm all in favor of that, transparency.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.520]   But at the same time, if you're trying to do a tech committee and you can't use any modern
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.800]   technological tools, it's really frustrating.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   I end up quitting.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:57.600]   Now I understand a little bit better why things take so long in government to happen.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:05.120]   So apparently they have an IT guy who set up these email addresses, 10 to 15 email addresses,
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:10.120]   chiefly the small circle of AIDS known in Alaskan political circles.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.560]   This is according to the Washington Post as "Palinistas" for their fierce loyalty to
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.360]   Palin.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.920]   They wanted an email system they had control over.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.280]   They also inquired about options for encrypting their email but gave up when they heard that
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:26.400]   the commercial encryption product was $1,000.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.280]   So these weren't encrypted.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.960]   They were stored on Yahoo's servers.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:36.480]   "Just pay a little bunny to get pop access to Yahoo mail and then PGP it.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.800]   I believe Hushmail is free, but okay."
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.560]   Or Hushmail, yeah.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.440]   Obviously, they need a better IT guy.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.320]   Anyway, they're going to have to preserve all those emails.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.640]   It would be hard.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.120]   But answer my question.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.360]   Scott, maybe you know.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.560]   Can the President of the United States have a private email conversation with his daughter?
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.000]   I believe.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.200]   I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that yes, you can have a private account to have
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.800]   private conversations.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:12.720]   But if you're doing anything related to government work, that needs to comply with all the rules
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.080]   and the rules involved the preservation of public records.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.080]   I think Bush said he was concerned about a freedom of information request.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:29.120]   Well, you preserve the records so that sooner or later they can be used by historians or
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.840]   the general citizenry.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.760]   We're paying them and they're doing our business and we have a right to know how it's proceeding.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.560]   But that's a burden that you have to consider in public office.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.840]   You really don't have any privacy.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.920]   I certainly understand the impulse to go around an IT department that doesn't give you what
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   you need.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.480]   I mean, I did that in my previous job.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.480]   You did it, right.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.000]   Yeah, he took away our email system at Tech TV.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.200]   So we went to Yahoo!
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.120]   Yeah, we were using Lotus.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.240]   So we made our own.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:08.080]   But that's the difference between being in public life and being a web producer at a
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.360]   small time cable network.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.760]   That doesn't even public be hell.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:20.000]   I'm going to talk just a little bit about the Android phone and amazing, amazing sales
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.160]   figures for the Android phone.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:26.200]   But first, I want to thank the folks at GoToMeeting, our sponsors today on the show.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.400]   GoToMeeting, I've talked about it before.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.400]   I use it all the time.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:35.760]   It is an online meeting system that is just swell, easy to use, very easy to set up.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.080]   Just a couple of minutes to set it up.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   You can do it right now.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.880]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.760]   A couple of clicks of the mouse within a couple of minutes, you'll have it set up Mac or PC.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.640]   And then it transforms your meetings.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.960]   Nobody wants to travel these days.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:52.680]   Who wants to get on an airplane, go through security, take off your shoes, get the middle
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   seat.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:59.840]   I talked to a friend of mine is going to Japan today for a meeting, like a two hour meeting,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.360]   and then flying back the day after.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.720]   It's 11 hours each way for a two hour meeting, not to mention the cost at the time.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.560]   I said, "David, go to meeting.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.080]   You got to learn about GoToMeeting.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.080]   Here's what happens.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.960]   You set it up on your computer."
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.080]   Then during a conference call or ahead of time, if you want, you can set out an invitation
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.040]   via Outlook or any email program.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.000]   But it's so simple, even during a conference call, you couple of clicks of the mouse.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.320]   And now you're on the phone and you say, "Look, I want to show you this PowerPoint,"
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.400]   or "I got to show you these documents," or "This is so cool.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   Let me show you this.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   I want this website.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.640]   I got this great YouTube video, whatever it is."
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.240]   And you say, "Okay, go to GoToMeeting.com."
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.240]   They say, "Okay."
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.560]   And they're in the meeting ID boom.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.440]   "Oh, there's your computer."
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.480]   They see your computer on their desktop.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.800]   You can show them anything you want.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.560]   You can give them control.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.800]   It's great for training, for sales, product demos.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:55.240]   I used it as I mentioned just a few weeks ago to rehearse a speech with somebody in
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.240]   LA.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   I was up here.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   Awesome.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.200]   Try it for free for 30 days, a month of unlimited online meetings.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.720]   Go to GoToMeeting.com/twit.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:09.640]   If you've never tried this before, try it free for 30 days and I think you'll see why.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.000]   I don't travel anymore.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   I stay here.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.160]   I use GoToMeeting.com/twit.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:21.080]   Harry, have you ordered your G1?
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.080]   I have not.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:26.800]   My understanding is that they gave first dibs on them to people who were existing T-Mobile
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.040]   customers, but I might well be in line now when the rest of us can get it.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.120]   I'm really disappointed.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.960]   I emailed contacts at Google.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.720]   I said, "Yeah, we have a limited number.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.880]   We'll send you one for review.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.760]   It'll be embargoed, but you'll be able to talk about it before it goes on sale."
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   I said, "I didn't get it."
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   I sent a note to the woman.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.200]   She said, "I'm on leave till October 27th."
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.200]   It's like, "No!
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.200]   No!"
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.200]   No!
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:52.280]   No, but I did order when I have a T-Mobile account, so I will have one October 22nd.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.280]   Am I crazy?
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.120]   I'm very excited about this.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.120]   I think it's...
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.080]   I thought more excited when I saw the launch than I thought I was going to be.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   It's wide open.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.000]   Look, we're not alone.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.320]   It looks like they've gone through two...
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.000]   They had the first round.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.960]   All the pre-orders sold out.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.040]   T-Mobile tripled their original request from HTC.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.480]   A second round sold out as well.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.840]   The number of pre-orders sold out combined to be about one and a half million units.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.600]   This is according to Pulse2.com.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   One and a half million units pre-sale.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.720]   Tom, is that bigger than the iPhone?
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.720]   I think it is.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.880]   Pre-sale, I think it is.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.640]   Because I don't think they hit a million until what?
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.680]   Like 18 days or something?
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   Why?
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.320]   Why is it so...
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.840]   Because people are out there dying...
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.080]   Oh, you sat on your mute button again.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.080]   It was Apple.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.640]   They were trying to stop me.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.600]   You can't say it, Merritt!
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.600]   I think people out there are dying for an alternative to the iPhone.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   So...
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   It's cheaper to tell...
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   It's cheaper to tell.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   It takes...
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   I mean, there's the LG DARE.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   There's the Samsung Instinct.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:08.400]   These are actually really exciting to some people, but nothing that's really captured
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.400]   imagination.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:14.160]   But you put Google's reality distortion field of their own behind something.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.160]   Make it look decent.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.600]   It's usable and it's got cool features.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.240]   I think that's why people are getting so excited about it.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.320]   It's weird to me because it's on the T-Mobile network.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.840]   But I think the platform also...
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.840]   It's also a big deal.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.840]   The storm will be a big deal, too.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:27.840]   You're right.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.840]   And it's on Verizon.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.160]   People are hungry for something cool, which is on Verizon.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.960]   You know why I want the G1 and not the storm?
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.960]   I want the keyboard.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.960]   But a lot of us don't want to keyboard.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.800]   And I think a lot of people just hate the idea of switching their carriers.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.440]   Even if they hate their carriers, it's just such a pain.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.240]   And they're just sort of...
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.480]   If there are T-Mobile customers, they're sitting there, and well, I would like to have an
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.080]   iPhone, but T-Mobile's not giving me an iPhone.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.680]   Oh, now they're giving me this.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.680]   Hooray.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:58.320]   Yeah, it is sad because the T-Mobile, for most of us, will be Edge in San Francisco.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.320]   Tom, you'll be able to use their 3G network.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.640]   I don't know how fast it'll be.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   They have it.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.600]   I think 2022 markets, something like that, they will have 3G networks.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.000]   In fact, they won't sell it in the stores, in the T-Mobile stores, unless the market that
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.680]   they're selling into has 3G.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.400]   Well, that's good.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.000]   But you can order it, as I did, from a market that doesn't.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.640]   So I'll be using it on Edge.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.720]   I can live with Edge speeds if the thing...
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.120]   I'm really interested in...
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:30.720]   First of all, you buy music from the Amazon Music Store, unprotected, 256 kilobits.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.960]   I like that.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:33.960]   There's going to be an App Store.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:40.640]   I'm looking at already what's out there on the Google App Store or on the Google page.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   And these look pretty good.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.880]   You can download an emulator and play with them, and they look pretty good.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.880]   It's got GPS.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.320]   It's going to have a lot of the features that the iPhone has.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.520]   It's got a real keyboard.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.600]   A little clunky here.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.640]   It's not as elegant.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.200]   Has anybody... any of you played with the Storm?
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.240]   I have no hands on it.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.880]   You know, there's this weird thing going on.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.880]   It's not haptic.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.040]   I thought it was haptic.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.440]   It's not haptic touch, but you have to push to click.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.440]   It's got a spring in it.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.440]   Yeah, you actually press down.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.440]   You have to press down.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.960]   What a terrible idea.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.200]   Really, I like that.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:16.400]   Again, I haven't put my hands on it yet, but I like the concept of actually having a little
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.840]   tactile feedback there.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:23.120]   But it's not... haptic I get excited about because then you could feel the controls.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.400]   But you have to push to click instead of tapping.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   What's wrong with tapping?
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.480]   That's too much effort to push.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.320]   It's too much effort to tap?
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.320]   Well, with the tapping, though, you don't get any real feedback.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.080]   I know with the haptic, you get a little bit.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.720]   But the whole stream moves.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.280]   The whole stream moves.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.680]   It's a giant button.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   I don't know.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.680]   It doesn't bother me at all.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:43.680]   Well, we'll see.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.160]   I guess we'll know when we get it.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:50.600]   The people I know who have touched the storm are relatively enthusiastic about that approach.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.520]   Does Sam Bazar, though?
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.080]   I think what's going to be really interesting is when you start seeing Android phones on
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.080]   the other networks.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   Right.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   When you stay...
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   Right.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.080]   Because I think you're right about Verizon.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:04.480]   The LG DARE has been the most popular review on CNET for the past three or four months.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:08.240]   And I think that's simply because it's a Verizon phone.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.920]   That's kind of like the iPhone.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.880]   You get an Android phone on Verizon.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:12.880]   It's going to go through the roof.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.800]   They'll be an Android phone, you think, eventually, for almost all the carriers.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.560]   Will AT&T get one?
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.240]   I bet they will.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.240]   Motorola says they're making them.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.240]   The only person that's...
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.640]   The only company that's not making them is Nokia.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.160]   Everybody else has agreed to make them.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.080]   So there are going to be a lot of great choices.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.080]   I am...
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.080]   Somebody who's ordered one.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.360]   I like the idea that there are a one and a half million others who have ordered them.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.000]   Because that means there's an ecology for the app store.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.720]   There'll be developers moving to it.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.640]   It's an easy platform to develop to.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.640]   It's Java.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:48.520]   I think you're going to see a lot of applications even from the Apple store.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.480]   And over.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.760]   Google is not going to be out there killing apps, right?
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.320]   I mean, as far as we know, it's all...
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.320]   No, you could...
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.320]   It's totally open.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.320]   You could put up your own web page.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.880]   You don't have to go through the store.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:03.280]   I could surf to your web page with the G1 and download it right there.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.320]   There's no requirement.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.760]   I think the store is important.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.760]   Is it T-Mobile or Google?
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.000]   I think T-Mobile is running the store.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.320]   I think it's important that you have a store.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:16.000]   I think that for novice users, that's one of the things that makes the iPhone very attractive
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.360]   is you can just go to that store and browse and buy.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.240]   But I think for advanced users, who cares?
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.440]   I mean, BlackBerry, for years you've had over the year downloads from websites.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.440]   It's not a difficult thing to figure out.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.520]   I'm actually excited about it.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.920]   I'm very excited that the sales are so high.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:34.280]   I think that that's a good sign.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.640]   It means that this will be a strong competitor.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.640]   I've used the instinct.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   I haven't used the dare.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.080]   I'm totally unimpressed.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.320]   I'm still an iPhone.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.720]   I'm an iPhone user until I see this G1.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.280]   Yeah, the browser is the killer on the iPhone.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.560]   Where's the bold?
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.480]   I just wrote about that.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:57.520]   I wrote several times about the fact that the bold was supposed to be out from AT&T
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.720]   during the summer, about the same time the iPhone 3G was.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.200]   I was really impatient about it, but just this last week, Orange in the UK, which had
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:09.480]   been selling the BlackBerry bold, pulled it off the market and said that the software
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.400]   was just not reliable enough.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.400]   That's bad.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.040]   I blocked again and I said, "Maybe AT&T did the right thing by not putting it out until
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.920]   they felt like it was ready for prime time."
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.920]   I think for a lot of people, the bold is going to be an exciting phone too because it truly
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:28.160]   is a BlackBerry that's part of the next generation of phones.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.440]   In terms of dots per inch, the resolution is higher than that of the iPhone and it has
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.080]   a real keyboard.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.000]   Everybody raves about the screen.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.840]   I haven't seen it, but everybody says the screen is gorgeous.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.840]   I saw the bold gosh back in the spring when I was still at PC World and it did knock my
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.720]   socks off.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:52.880]   Is there anything besides these phones, any dark horse that's going to come out of nowhere?
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.000]   Anybody got something coming that's...
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   You've got a figure.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.640]   It's been a year and a half since the iPhone came out.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   Every company.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.000]   Where's Nokia on all this?
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   Why is it?
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.880]   Because the 5800 Express music, which has yet another iPhone like phone, and Nokia has
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.040]   this comes with music plan which lets you download all the music you want for the time
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.160]   you own the phone.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.200]   That looks like the closest thing that Nokia has come up with to an iPhone killer.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.920]   They've got their own open platform to try to compete with Android now that they've opened
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   up Simby into.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.360]   Simby and it's a lot of work though to sort of be a modern phone op-room.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.040]   It's a little 90s.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.720]   I was a big fan of the Scion.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.720]   Oh, me too.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.320]   In fact, in a way, Harry, I'm kind of hoping that this G1 will be a Scion.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.240]   I've been looking for a modern Scion since they stopped making psions.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240]   Me too.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.920]   It had a better keyboard than any modern phone does by far.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   I love my 3A.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.640]   I would still use it if it were a little more modern.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.840]   Honestly, that's what I'm really hoping from the G1.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.520]   I'm looking at this Nokia.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.000]   It looks just like an iPhone.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.880]   It couldn't be more like an iPhone.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.400]   I mean, I remember when they first announced it, everybody was joking that they just took
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.080]   an iPhone and photoshopped it to be a Nokia.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.080]   It looks like a...
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.880]   I mean, it's got roughly the same size, same screen, same bezel.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.720]   Somewhat better camera.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.600]   That's one thing the iPhone really lacks.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.040]   The two megapixel camera nowadays.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.080]   The G1 will have a 3 megapixel, but come on, let's get a real camera in one of these
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.080]   phones.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.480]   No, all you want is 2 megapixels.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.640]   Really why?
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.120]   Because that's what Steve Jobs said.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   Oh, of course.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.520]   I'm sorry, Steve.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.160]   You don't want more than 2 megapixels.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.320]   Don't ever retire, Steve.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.320]   Please, we love you.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.720]   The Nokia also has an FM radio, by the way.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.960]   Does anybody want a radio?
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960]   I don't need a radio.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:52.760]   I've got about four radio applications on my iPhone that are far better, including many
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.480]   radio stations that are far better than...
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.480]   Who needs a radio?
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.280]   I need an AM radio.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.560]   I never put an AM radio.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.560]   It's always an FM.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560]   I never do.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.040]   But I'm telling you, that's why you look Tom on the iPhone.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040]   You have an iPhone, right?
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.240]   You get the AOL radio app?
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.280]   AOL radio, Pandora.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.200]   But then there's also this from a Nell River.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.640]   The reason I know about it is because we're broadcasting on it is the Tuner Internet Radio,
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:26.520]   which has hundreds of stations, including our station, which is twit.am/listen.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.760]   Then the Clear Channel just put out one called iHeartRadio that has half...
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.120]   It's kind of silly because it only has about half a dozen stations.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.320]   But if you want to listen to one of those stations, it's there.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.680]   It's pretty amazing, I think.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.480]   It's just all about coverage versus FM in those cases.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.120]   I'm not sure how many people really want radio on their device anyway, for real.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.200]   But if you want Pandora instead of an FM station?
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.080]   If you do, AM and FM are a little better coverage than 3G and Edge sometimes.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.080]   But I guess...
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.760]   I don't know that it makes that much of a difference.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.400]   It's one of those things I like to have when I had FM radio on my phone.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.120]   I used it from time to time, but don't terribly miss it, but I don't have it.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.280]   Well, if I were a satellite radio, I would just be...
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.760]   If XM and Sirius would...
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.280]   We'll just give up the ghost.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.280]   Who's gonna pay...
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.280]   Truckers.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280]   Truckers.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.240]   Yeah, but I listen to my car on Edge to our station all over town.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.760]   I guess if you're in the middle of Utah...
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.280]   There aren't enough truckers to pay down their debt.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280]   They can't...
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.480]   Truckers aren't gonna pay for Howard Stern half a billion dollars.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.480]   It ain't gonna happen.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.280]   It's not enough to keep a business going.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.920]   Yeah, it doesn't seem like it.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:39.200]   The other rumor that dropped this week is that the Zoom...
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:45.280]   Or that Microsoft would be making Zoom software for all of its mobile operating systems.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.080]   And so a lot of people were putting two and two together and saying the Zoom phone would
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.240]   come out of that effort.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   Yeah, Zoom phone.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.720]   Oh, that'll be big.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.320]   That's gonna be huge.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.000]   Well, it actually is a good point that Microsoft's Windows mobile, which does power a lot of
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:07.400]   phones right now, is starting to look like S60 as a much of an also ran palm as also ran.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.400]   Uh-huh.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.640]   It's really not in the game at all anymore.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:15.480]   And there are these rumors that the next generation Windows mobile has been delayed
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.280]   again until, I think, 2011 or something.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.000]   Are you going to PDC, Harry?
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   I am.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.960]   That sounds like it's gonna be a good show because it's gonna be the first time that Microsoft
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.600]   really talks about Windows 7 in any great detail about the live mesh.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.480]   I mean, I think this is gonna be the live mesh show.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.040]   And Windows Cloud, which...
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.040]   Right, whatever that is.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.520]   ... talked about a couple of weeks ago.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.000]   And nobody is quite clear what it is.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   Strata.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.840]   It's gonna be called Strata.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.480]   I think, actually, that's...
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.480]   Cumulo Nimbus.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.480]   They could call it...
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.480]   Little puffy cloud.
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.480]   I think that there...
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.480]   I think this is...
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.000]   You know, I don't know if Microsoft will be able to turn it because this is a big turn
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.040]   for Microsoft to go from desktop-based operating systems and software.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.880]   But boy, this is the cloud computing is the future.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:03.320]   And if anybody could really kind of throw a lot of weight behind it, it's Ray Aussie,
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:09.480]   and it's Microsoft, and I think I'm very intrigued about what this live mesh/strata is gonna be.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.560]   We'll do a special show after PDC.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560]   Maybe you'll join us, Harry.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560]   I hope you will.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.560]   Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, and...
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.560]   How's it going?
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.960]   Paul, Jerry Pournell, and we have you two.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.480]   Certainly there's a lot of attention to Windows 7.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.800]   I wonder if Windows 7 will ever ship.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:25.160]   If cloud computing really takes off, who needs an operating system?
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:30.960]   Windows 7 may well be the last sort of Windows as we knew Windows for the last almost quarter
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.960]   century.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.040]   I kind of think so, too.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.720]   I think they will ship Windows 7 just because they're so far down the road with it.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.480]   But they may actually do with Windows 7 what they intended to do originally with XP, which
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:46.960]   was they'll be the Microsoft experience and you'll just keep adding to it and it'll extend
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.440]   into the Internet.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.640]   There's Midori, which has a project to build whatever replaces Windows, whenever that comes
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.040]   that Microsoft has talked a tiny bit about.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.360]   But I think it has to be real someday.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.520]   Isn't Midori a melon liqueur?
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.160]   Yeah, Midori margaritas are quite tasty.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.160]   Also a famous classical musician.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.080]   Oh, I wonder.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.320]   So are the next editions of Windows going to be named after classical musicians or liqueurs?
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.280]   Any combination, that's what it'll be named.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.480]   Microsoft Yo-Yo Ma.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.720]   No, maybe Microsoft Schnapps.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.600]   That would work.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.120]   The great classical musician Schnapps.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:30.720]   Herbert Schnapps.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.720]   Let's see.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.720]   There's one more story.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.040]   I don't know if you're going to get all head up about this or not.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.360]   I am.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.360]   I think that it's appalling what the cell phone companies charge for text messaging and somehow
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.760]   they miraculously all came to the same price together without colluding in any way, 20
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.440]   cents a message, which translates to 1,500 bucks a megabyte.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.360]   Now, they're not not enough.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.720]   The rise in is announced the starting November 1st, they're going to charge $0.03 for the
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.080]   other side.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:05.400]   So if your bank or your airline or Amazon is texting you, not only do you pay the $0.20
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.760]   for the incoming message, but they have to pay $0.03 per mobile terminated message.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.400]   It's called a mobile terminated message charge.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.120]   And I wonder if that's just enough.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.560]   Maybe it's enough to kill spammers.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.440]   Maybe it's so much it'll kill all of this.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.680]   Do you get your baseball score sent to you by text message?
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.680]   You're following the World Series that way?
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   I am.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.120]   I don't know if people will be doing continue to do this.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.000]   If it's going to cost them $0.03 a message.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.920]   Yeah, goog411, all of that stuff.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.280]   And I guess the way I read it, and I don't know, maybe Harry or Scott Noob's better here,
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   but I believe the termination rate on Verizon was a penny.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.200]   And so they're essentially quadrupling the price.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.200]   They're raising it $0.03.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   It was less than a penny.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.000]   That's my understanding.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.200]   It reminds me of ATMs where I get charged by both my bank and the other bank.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:59.280]   It seems like they can make enough money off me once and they don't need to double dip
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.800]   and it might just kill SMS.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.800]   I'm sad.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:08.320]   I had a dream that Google was going to buy this 700 megahertz frequency stuff.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:15.040]   They were going to set up kind of an open new style wireless communications and using
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:21.440]   voiceover this wireless thing as well as data and just put these guys out of business.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   The cell phone companies are just appalling.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.000]   They're rapacious.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.760]   They're worse than the record companies.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:31.360]   Yeah, I think the Google that was going to be able to do that was the Google whose stock
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.160]   was 700 or whatever it was anymore.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:41.600]   Sadly, I think the prospects of that sort of building from them are not good now.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.200]   Hey, we went through this whole show and didn't mention the stock market.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   Sorry.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.280]   What's going on with stock market?
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280]   I don't know.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.280]   I hear things.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.280]   I don't know.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.080]   I just keep bars of gold under my bed.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:02.080]   You know, isn't it interesting how you're watching CNBC and all of these forex ads start
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.080]   showing up?
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.520]   Get into the foreign exchange business or I'm waiting for the Franklin Mint to start
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.520]   up again.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520]   Gold coins.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:16.000]   In the backyard, you might have a fortune in your closet.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.880]   We talk about this every week, but is it scary for the tech industry?
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.880]   Are we seeing we've seen some layoffs this week.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:27.440]   eBay fired a thousand smaller companies like seismic laid off nine.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.000]   Are we going to start seeing that?
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.680]   It seems like it's a little early for this to impact the tech industry.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.080]   Everybody's getting ready for it.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:39.120]   I mean, everybody who has any venture capital investment is in a mode where they're going
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.720]   to spend as little as possible and just conquer down.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.800]   Well, obviously it's going to affect everybody, right?
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.680]   It's going to tighten up a lot, isn't it?
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:51.840]   This is not going to leave anyone untouched, but the more capital investment you need to
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.120]   run your business, the harder it's going to be.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.920]   I mean, the things that I was reading at the end of the week last week, basically we're
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:03.920]   saying if you're a small startup, your eventual capital funding may push on you to be more
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.200]   efficient, but it should keep coming.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:10.800]   If you're in green tech or biotech as a startup where you need huge capital outlays, that's
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.200]   where you're going to really feel a pinch.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200]   Too bad.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.760]   That's what we need the most.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:19.640]   I always think of the crash of '87 when I back worked for a small tech startup and when
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:25.240]   it happened, the president called us all together and said the good times were over for a decade
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.200]   to come and he laid off a third of the company.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:34.440]   And within a matter of months, that crash, the stock market was back to where it was before
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.840]   that happened and boom thereafter.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.920]   So I think even the smartest people are not that great at predicting the future.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.120]   Yeah, who knows what's really going to happen, I guess.
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:49.280]   But the market for books about blogging is going to go through the roof.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.400]   There's no doubt about it.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.400]   That's all people will have left to do after they get laid off.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.480]   Well, blogs, the cost of starting a blog is less than zero.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.040]   It's just your time.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:06.320]   So hopefully, a lot of blogging actually started during the last downturn.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.320]   That's true.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320]   It took off during the last downturn.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.960]   A lot of people at home.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   Exactly.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.640]   You had all these people in the tech industry who were unemployed and putting a lot of their
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:21.200]   energy into just keeping their name out there on their blogs.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:28.600]   And so I, all joking aside, I think it is strangely a recession proof industry since
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.440]   it's not really much of an industry at all.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.120]   It's the cost, you know, costs are minimal.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:40.160]   And you know, the only thing that it really takes is some kind of passion or insanity.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.600]   Kathy Sierra actually was saying that on Twitter last night that, you know, that was
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.320]   the last downturn that got her changing career and that got her doing what she's doing now.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.160]   She's, you know, she's grateful in a way.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   I imagine.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.800]   I think it depends on how you support yourself by your blog.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.680]   I mean, I think if you're operating in some sort of micro economy of your own, and I think
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.120]   of people like Jonathan Colton, where, you know, they're getting the money direct from
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.480]   their fans for what they produce, I think that is very recession resistant because people
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.120]   still want entertainment.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.840]   And it's not that costly to pay 99 cents or so for a song and to go out and see a show.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.080]   You might be able to afford that.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:26.600]   I think if you've got a big blogging enterprise that relies on advertising, they're advertising
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.520]   might is going to dry up a little bit for a while.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.280]   Is it, you think, I mean, technologizer is a federated media, right?
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.280]   Yes.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.440]   And if the advertising market just dies, it will be bad news for me.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:44.600]   But my costs are low compared to even a salon or not let alone something like PC world.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.520]   I don't have dozens of people.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.360]   They have me and a few contributors running out on staff.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.800]   Well, I appreciate you not saying CNET.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.000]   Hey, you're a CBS joint now.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   You can't.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   You can't go anywhere.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.800]   Well, thank goodness we have a Papa.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:06.400]   You know, I would think that I would hope and certainly as a podcaster, I hope that advertisers
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:12.280]   would see new media as a more targeted, more efficient, more less expensive, more valuable
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.120]   proposition and maybe flock to it as opposed to abandon it.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.120]   I think they will.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.240]   I mean, I think the newspapers are and to some extent the broadcasters are in much, you
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:28.640]   know, have a lot more to fear right now than the small, you know, smaller, nimbler online
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.040]   publishers because people understand that, you know, this is where this is where the growth
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.680]   is and there's growth even in a downturn, you know, and they're going to be looking to
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.320]   spend advertising dollars as smartly as they can.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.320]   Yeah, I think it's, I think you're right.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.200]   And I don't think the advertising market is just going to die.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.600]   I think it's going to, they're going to be a little pickier about where they spend their
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.600]   money.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.040]   That could benefit certain blogs and podcasts for, sir.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.040]   See, seismic, I'm sorry, laid off seven not nine.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.040]   I apologize.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.520]   Now, was Gawker talking about laying off people?
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.520]   Parker had some layoffs.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520]   Yeah, just, yeah.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:08.240]   Gocker really cut the staffs very heavily at the blogs that were not the most promising
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.440]   advertising vehicles.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.600]   But you know, he doesn't, Nick Denton does this every two years or so.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:18.080]   He declares that there is a recession coming and that's kind of his stick.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.720]   And he may, you know, this time he happens to be right, but he, his whole modus operandi
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.000]   has always been to talk down the future.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.280]   Blogging is never going to make anybody any money.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.800]   He's going to, he's, he's been pulling in his horns ever, you know, on a regular basis
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800]   for a long time.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.360]   So, you know, I don't take that as a real bell weather.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.760]   I just see that is, that's his, his, his natural behavior.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.760]   He's cheap.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.760]   Well, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was,
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.760]   what was the whole way?
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.360]   Look, this guy's actually falling this time.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.360]   Ooh.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:57.360]   Rafe Needle, man, on his webware column on a CNET wrote about companies that might be
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:04.120]   gone in the next, in this, in this big recession and Twitter, he put Twitter among them.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:08.800]   And Mibo, which is a great service and one which I really hope does find a way.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.320]   Mibo's like, like Facebook kind of or MySpace.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.880]   Mibo is instant messaging.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880]   That's right.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.720]   Apparently within the browser and it was very well done.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.240]   I was thinking of Bebo, not Mibo.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240]   Mibo is, yeah.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240]   Trip it.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.080]   He mentioned Zillow, Pandora, of course.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.080]   Here's a surprise.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   Second life.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.520]   You know, a second life has a revenue model.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.080]   You pay to be part of it.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.560]   It's just a matter of whether people, enough people are paying, which I think is questionable
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.560]   right now.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.000]   If the economy turns down, you know, it could dry it up really quickly.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.360]   I think what he's saying in this, in this column is these are the companies that have
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.560]   to really act.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.040]   It's not necessarily that they're done for it.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.840]   He's saying Twitter has to find a revenue model if they're going to succeed, if they're going
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.840]   to survive, I should say.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.520]   I mean, at least Mibo does have a revenue model.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.480]   There is advertising there and Twitter has kind of had the luxury of not seeking one
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.320]   yet.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:09.240]   And so you think maybe their investors will say, okay, no more money.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.760]   You got to come up with some way of making money.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.760]   Skype.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.760]   Here's an interesting one.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:18.360]   They've already made noises about selling off Skype, which it bought for an astronomical
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   amount of money.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.280]   But a rave points out, there's nobody going to buy it at that price.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.560]   So they can't sell it.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.960]   Yeah, they'd have to take a loss on it at this point.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.360]   And I don't think it really makes sense for eBay.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.560]   They had all these ideas of how they were going to integrate it into the auction process.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.520]   And they never really took advantage of that.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:38.560]   Here's the biggest surprise, MySpace.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.560]   What's the logic behind that?
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.640]   He says, although it's generating a lot of revenue and under the eegis of Rupert Murdoch,
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.800]   an notoriously ruthless business man could easily cut loose.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.720]   Oh, he's thinking Rupert could cut loose MySpace.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720]   Yeah, I asked him.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.640]   He was on Buzz out a lot Friday and I asked him about that one particularly.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.360]   And he said he thinks that Rupert is impatient.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.000]   He'll dump stuff if it starts to turn sour quickly.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.280]   And he thinks that MySpace could start to be a little rocky and that Rupert might ditch
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.280]   it.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.240]   The momentum is against them.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.600]   I'm not sure I entirely agree with him.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.920]   I think that that thing is so huge.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.040]   And I think I don't think Rupert is going to dump it as quickly as he might dump some
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.040]   other things.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.240]   I think if you're Rupert Murdoch or any sensible businessman, this is the time that
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:29.520]   you say you hunker down, you reduce the spending as much as you can, you prepare for down times.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.640]   But you use this as an opportunity to build audience and to build market share.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.440]   It's actually a great opportunity.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:40.440]   I think Jason has said that a couple of twists ago, this is an opportunity if you can survive
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.440]   it.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:47.480]   But he is hunkered down, not spin off or get rid of.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:52.560]   Well we're going to get rid of ourselves here because I think we've talked enough about
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560]   the tech of the week.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.800]   But I am so glad we could get all three of you on here.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.760]   Scott Rosenberg is working on his new book.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.760]   You have an ETA?
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.800]   I know you said your deadline is December 1st.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.040]   It will be out next June or July of '09.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.840]   Oh, that's the target.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.840]   Isn't publishing lightning quick?
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.720]   This is considered a fast turnaround.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.080]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.280]   Is it a little frustrating after working online?
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.360]   Oh man, that's the hardest thing.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:31.640]   But I force myself to take a very relaxed, zan attitude and I figure you just have to
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:38.760]   accept that the printing presses are in their own space and that's just what it takes.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.000]   It's just a different way of being.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.120]   You never did answer Harry's question.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.600]   Who was the first blogger?
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.600]   Well he was obviously.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.080]   Justin Hall, some say?
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.720]   You know, I really don't think there is any one person.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.040]   I think Justin Hall is in my book, Dave Weiner is in my book.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.720]   Jordan Barger is the guy who invented the word web blog and it was an evolution, right?
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:09.760]   Each of these people contributed something and it all kind of coalesced over time into
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.440]   what we call a blog today.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.080]   I remember having Justin on.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.080]   Justin helped us.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.800]   Didn't he, Tom, early on in tech TV as a consultant?
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.880]   I remember having him on call for help.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.000]   Yeah, I think he talked with David Miller in that era.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.560]   He came in and a kilt.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.760]   Yeah, he always had a great outfit.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.160]   Yeah, he was a great dancer and then I remember we had him on call for help and we went to
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.320]   the front page of his blog which featured a full frontal nude picture of himself which
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:40.680]   was I think the first time, not the last time that happened on tech TV and we were live.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.680]   Oh yes.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.520]   I remember that one.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.440]   So it's funny though, I mean, you know, blogging isn't that old.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:51.240]   I mean, it's recent memory that it was born.
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:56.680]   And yet the people, you know, because of the people in the industry are just very forgetful
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.000]   of recent history.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.880]   They just aren't interested.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:05.640]   And it seems to me that all of the things that these bloggers learned are lessons that,
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:10.200]   you know, people are needing it with each new turn of the wheel in the industry, whether
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:15.160]   it's Facebook or, you know, whatever it is that we're doing, it's the same lessons about
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.360]   how to behave online.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.360]   I agree.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.920]   In fact, I look with great interest for the book because I've been saying for some time
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:28.080]   podcasters, internet broadcasters should look at the history of blogging if they want
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.240]   to know what's going to happen.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.280]   I mean, there's a, there are so much stuff that just never changes.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.960]   I mean, it was on BBSs in the late seven days.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.120]   That was not such a different world from the world of blogging in a lot of ways.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:43.520]   No, I ran a BBS in 1984, MacQ.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   And it is.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520]   It's very similar.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:50.080]   It's, you know, I mean, this stuff is really, it just keeps, keeps coming around.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.440]   Well, I can't wait to see it.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:54.840]   And I wish we were coming out sooner, but Scott, we will have you back when it comes
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840]   out if not sooner.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:56.840]   Great.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.200]   The wordyard.com is Scott's blog address.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.320]   Harry McCracken is the technologizer.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.080]   The technologizer.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.920]   The machines rules the world.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:13.920]   And you go to technologizer.com to read about it.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.840]   I think I like it because it's very personal.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:19.120]   You know, there's the, you have the C nets of the world, the PC worlds of the world where
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.840]   you have kind of, you know, reviews and, but this, but this is about you and about your
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.840]   relationship to technology.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.400]   And I frankly, frankly, I like that.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.400]   It's a bunch.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.400]   I'm having fun.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.400]   I'm also, I'm also signing up other people.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.400]   I have some new writers too.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.280]   And I'm looking for folks who, who have that personal touch.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.280]   All right.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.400]   Technologizer is smarter take on tech.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.120]   Buzz out loud is the definitive tech news podcast.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:47.880]   I must listen every single day of the week, Tom Merritt and the lovely Hollywood.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.400]   We try to fill the gap between twits for people.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.560]   You do a good job.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.560]   Too good a job.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:53.560]   Will you stop it?
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:54.560]   Not the law.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.560]   The weekend is yours.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560]   Knock it off.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.560]   Thank God.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.320]   We divided that up early on.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   It was a good thing.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.320]   We had that handshake.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.800]   I think we got the harder part of the market.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.800]   You do it five times a week.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.800]   I'll do it once.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.200]   But I'll do it for a lot longer.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.200]   There we go.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.600]   B.O.L. dot C net.com a must listen.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.600]   And thank you.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.600]   A pleasure as always.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:14.600]   Oh, it's great to have you on.
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.600]   Always a good, good time.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.600]   Thank you all for listening.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.600]   We'll see you next time.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.600]   Another twit.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.600]   This is amazing.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:26.600]   I should have paid attention.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:34.600]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.600]   Too much work.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.600]   The problem is there's no limit.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:45.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.600]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.600]   There's no limit.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.600]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:51.600]   So here's the deal.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.600]   I'm just trying to get the thing off.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.600]   But I have a hell of a time to point what blue screen's like.
