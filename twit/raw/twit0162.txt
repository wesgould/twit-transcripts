[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I want to be like Jim Lair.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   John, you could talk to Will Harris, you know.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Will Harris is also here.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   He is from the lovely island of England.

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   >> Of course you are.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   >> Now, Andrew, we're not going to keep you for long because we want to
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   leave room for Patrick Norton, who may join us in the middle of the
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   show.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Of course, with my luck, Patrick's plumbing problems will take
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   hours and we won't get him and then we'll -- but anyway.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But thank you for being here also.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   >> Well, thanks for having me.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I had this epiphany this week.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   >> You had an epiphany.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Should I get back in the stock market?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I sold all my stocks because of you.

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Have you given me the sign?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Did you wiggle your hips?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Did you adjust your shorts?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   >> No, but that is exactly the epiphany.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I was talking to John as a matter of fact.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And I said, John, think about this for a second.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It was so odd that commercial, the whole discussion about, you know,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   with the churros and the shoes and the crazy --
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   >> Oh, we're back to that.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   >> Yeah, well, it came over to me.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Listen to this.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   You're going to love this.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   When he said, give me a sign, adjust your shorts.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It occurred to me.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   >> Short stocks.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   He was short selling.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   >> It was short selling adjusted right after that they came out with an
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   18% increase in their dividend.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   They came out with a $40 billion buyback.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   The stock went up about, I don't know, about 15% right afterwards.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It was assigned everybody out there to get out of the way Microsoft
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   is starting to move again.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   What do you think?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> No.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> But I do want to get you on to explain -- because a number of people wrote to
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   me and said, would you please have Andrew on and explain why this buyback.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   What does Microsoft get?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   What was it?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   A $40 billion buyback?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   What did they buyback?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> Well, it's interesting.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Yeah, $40 billion.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Well, what's that number?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   $40 billion was the number they were coming in for Yahoo, right?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   >> Oh.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   >> That's interesting.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I think it was assigned to Yahoo, first of all, that, you know what, you guys were
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   really done.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Really -- we don't have the cash anymore.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   We spend it on a Ferrari.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   >> Right, exactly.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And the second thing is, if you look at buybacks, without getting too technical,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   the interesting thing is when they do a buyback and at the same time do a
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   dividend increase, it really doesn't cost them anything.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And that's because they have all these shares that they're buying back and
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   they have already in Treasury, and the 18% increase in dividend is going to
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   equate to basically a zero cost to them on the outlay.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So it really is kind of a good thing for them.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> This is more move.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> Yeah, very smart.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> Why do companies traditionally do buyback their stock?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Is it to go private?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   >> To plug it up.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   >> Yeah, they put it up.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It's kind of a joke, as I think John would say it's bogus.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You know, what they do is they try to increase their EPS, their earnings per
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   share, and they do it artificially because now they have less shares
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   outstanding and more earnings per share.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Frankly, I think it's a pretty -- it's a good thing, generally speaking, it
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   shows the world they have a good feeling for their stock, but at the same time,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I think it is kind of bogus because it really doesn't give you a correct
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   fundamental understanding of what's happening because they're just
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   artificially increasing their earnings.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   >> Yeah, their earnings for share looks better, but they actually -- they
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   can't actually have -- the revenues could go down.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   >> Now, historically Microsoft has not been a dividend stock.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   When did they start paying dividends?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> Well, they started paying -- yeah, a few years ago, they were -- when they first
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   came into the Dow, a few years back, and all of a sudden started having a
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   dividend out of -- it was very, very minor, nothing major, but they started
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   having dividends, and it was kind of interesting because no technology
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   stocks really paid any dividends.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   >> Yeah, usually they want to keep the money reinvested because it's such a
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   fast-paced industry.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's very important to do R&D.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Is that not right?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   >> Yeah, it was, but if you look at the numbers and how many shares Mr.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Gates had, it was quite a remarkable amount of income for --
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   >> -- at a reduced tax rate.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Dividends are taxed at 15%.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   >> So it was really just to pay bill off.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Well, maybe Mr. Bomber II.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   >> I think for a long time, Bill did not want to go public.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   He didn't want his employees looking at the stock price every 10 minutes.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   He didn't want to do a dividend, but at some point you get to a certain age
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   where you got to think about college for your kids and you want to get some
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   money out of it.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   >> No, actually the story is the following.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Bill, you're right.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He never wanted to go public, but he kept promising all the employees as the
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   company got bigger and bigger that they were going to go public and they were
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   all going to get a piece of it.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   >> Right.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   >> And so he finally had to re-nig and actually go public because he didn't
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   want to.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   >> All right.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And the 18% increase in the dividend, what do you think that portends,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Andrew?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   >> Well, that's just to offset the cost of the share buyback.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   >> So in other words, it's a scam.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's a scam.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It's a net -- no loss to them.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   >> Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say it's a scam in the sense of an eBay scam,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   but it is a -- you know, it is a scam.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's a -- you know, they don't lose anything on the bill.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   >> It's tricky.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   >> It's tricky.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> Hey, Andrew, I want to thank you for coming in and filling us in.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   >> We appreciate it.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   >> You're a problem, guys.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   >> I like your epiphany.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   >> Thanks, man.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   >> Don't get weak at it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   >> Don't change a thing.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Andrew Horowitz of the Discipline Investor to the Discipline Investor.com,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   again, I'm in to talk about Money Matters.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   People are saying, "Talk about tech.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   This is tech.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   This is a huge company in tech, and this is a big tech issue.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I want to take a break.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   We are going to talk -- we have some actually some very interesting stories to talk about,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   including a new earthquake study that involves you and your laptop.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   But first, I want to mention Audible.com.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Our friends at Audible have come back with that special two-book offer.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   We want to keep that going.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   The Platinum Plan, you get two books free.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   If you go to Audible.com/twit2, Audible.com/twit2.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   One of the benefits, by the way, of both the Golden Platinum Plans, and I didn't even know
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   this, and I'm missing out here, you get a free subscription to the Wall Street Journal of the
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   New York Times Daily Audio version.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So I want to underscore the fact that we talk about books all the time, but you can listen
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   to your newspapers this way.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   You can listen to lectures, speeches, radio.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   There's a ton of great audio content.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Let's go to Audible.com and browse around, and then when you're ready to sign up, please
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   use Audible.com/twit2.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Sign up for that Platinum Plan.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   You'll get two books a month, but also when you sign up, you'll get two credits, and if
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   you sign up to stick around, no sweat, no problem.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   You get to keep the books.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Here is the book I'm going to strongly recommend for you.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I just read this in paper because it wasn't out yet on Audible.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It is now out.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Neil Stevenson's Anithym, his new book, which came out just about a week ago, a truly awesome
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   book.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I am a huge Neil Stevenson fan, crypto-nomicon, snow crash, the Baroque cycle.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   This is one of our best writers.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I don't even want to say sci-fi writers.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   He calls it speculative fiction.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I think that's probably more accurate.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Anithym starts out in a monastery, but it's a different kind of monastery.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.120]   It's a different world in a galaxy, of course, but the people of this world have segregated
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.560]   the smart ones because they're scared of them.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.360]   They take nuclear power, astrophysicists, everybody who knows anything, and they put
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   them in monasteries for centuries, for millennia.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.080]   Something happens, and they have to crack open the monasteries.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.560]   They need the brains, and it is a great read, a great story.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   It's long, too.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.360]   32 hours of great audible.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.200]   And they've done one of these, I don't know, let me listen to the excerpt.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.480]   I'm not sure if you'll hear it, but they've done one of these audible dramatizations where
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.240]   they have multiple voices.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.400]   They do such a good job at this.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.720]   You may speak of carrots, potatoes, dogs, cats, etc.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.920]   This doesn't mean that Arb has exactly the same species.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.840]   Naturally, I'll just say that.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.920]   That's actually from the introduction.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.200]   That's well before the story gets started.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.480]   Oliver Wyman, Tavia Gilbert, William Dufres, and Neil Stevenson are in this recording.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.760]   We try to get Neil for an interview on a Twit, by the way, and he's like the JD-Sallinger
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   of our generation.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   He doesn't talk.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.360]   He said, "No, I'm not comfortable doing interviews.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   I'm sorry."
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.520]   But, you know what?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.800]   Let the book stand for itself, anithym, highly recommended.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.480]   You get it free by going to audible.com/twit2.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.680]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.440]   All right, Will Harris.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.160]   What happened?
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160]   What happened?
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   You got married.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   Congratulations.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.480]   I feel very good about that.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.320]   And you've twittered it.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.480]   Yeah, well, I thought...
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.720]   If Alex Andrew didn't leave you after that, you got a good woman.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.520]   Maybe she was twittering too.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.720]   Was she twittering too?
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.800]   No, she wasn't.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.160]   She was far too busy doing all those things that girls do.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160]   Was that you were standing up at the...
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.800]   You were standing up at the podium, getting married and typing.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.840]   Were you using a microphone?
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.480]   I waited till I sat down again.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   Well, I thought, you know, you've got everyone gets the pre-wetting jitters.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.440]   So I thought, "Well, what shall I do this part of my daily routine that will keep me
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.760]   grounded and feeling sane?"
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.120]   I thought, "I know, I'll just Twitter the whole day."
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.280]   Oh, see, I broke out the playboys.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.280]   So all right, I get it.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.520]   All right, so you Twitter, isn't it?
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   Absolutely.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.120]   You know, I'll Twitter going and getting a sandwich before lunch, you know.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.160]   Twitter getting all my stuff together, all my buttonholes in and walking down to the
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   church and waiting around.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.960]   You crack me up, dude.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.600]   Yeah, why not?
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   Why not?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   You crack me up.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   You know what was really nice?
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.200]   Twitter community was like, "I got so many best wishes and congratulations and things."
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.840]   It was absolutely lovely.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.840]   So much.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   I got them all.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.840]   Thank you.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.640]   If I go, how far back do I have to go?
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.800]   Oh, like a fortnight?
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.600]   It's two weeks for those of you who speak, do not speak the King's English.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   It's a queen, isn't it?
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   Sorry.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   I'm going there.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   I just want to read this.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.600]   I want to read your wedding.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   So this is good.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.920]   Did you preserve this in the album?
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   We haven't put the album together.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   You put the album together.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.080]   I think your Twitter should be right along the side of the pictures.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.600]   We've got, I mean, the amazing thing about doing a wedding these days is not only do you
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   have your official photographer, you've got like at least 10, 20 other people who have
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.320]   all got digital cameras there.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.520]   What was the wedding date?
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.520]   The 13th.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   Already he's forgotten.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.520]   September 13th?
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.520]   All right.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.520]   So I'm going to September 13th.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.080]   So while you're doing that, I'm going to throw a question out there.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.360]   You know, the machine I do, these podcasts on, just a regular Windows machine, but I can
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.960]   never log on to Twitter, which is why they're saying don't take messages.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.400]   And then when I ask it to reset my password, it says I don't exist.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.960]   But every other machine I use, I use the same exact...
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   Clear your cookies.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.360]   It's just a cookie thing.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.480]   Just go into your cookies and delete all the cookies from Twitter.com.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.080]   However, you should be using twirl.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080]   Are you not using twirl?
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   Twirl's awesome.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.080]   I love twirl.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   All right.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.080]   I'll go use twirl.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.080]   Twirl's great.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.840]   In fact, twirl, you can also post the twit army.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   You could post twirl.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   No, I understand.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   I'm going to do that.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.440]   I get this that gives me a feeling for how well the Twitter service itself is doing,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.440]   though.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   No, no, it's not that.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   No, it's not that.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.400]   It's actually, isn't there a website?
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   Is Twitter down?
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.000]   I think it's is Twitter down.com.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And you can go there...
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.560]   Which is second, second and usefulness to the sparkly sublime down for everyone, or
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   just me, Doc.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.360]   I love that, too.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.560]   So if you go to is Twitter down.com, John, and it'll say no, and then you'll know, okay,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.560]   it's me.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.160]   And then it wasn't cut down for everyone or just me.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.320]   Is that what it is?
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.600]   Yeah, Doc.com, which is fantastic.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.120]   Was someone says, this is so and so down for you.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.320]   And I just reply with down for everyone just me to come.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.880]   So let me in the spirit of things.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   Let me share with you just very quickly a couple of revelations of tech revelations
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.880]   I had on my honeymoon.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.440]   Well, wait a minute, before you do this, let me just read some of the Twitters.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.000]   I may be getting married later today, but right now it's party time.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.600]   Okay, the Will Harris Twitter wedding countdown starts here.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.400]   Bed up in six hours to get ready.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   Up coffee breakfast weather sunny.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.800]   10 a.m. getting in the groove.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   1130.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.600]   Okay, folks, pregame starts here.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   Shower shave more coffee at the chapel now.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.520]   Got the fear.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   Holy crap.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   I do.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.280]   You said I do.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.800]   On Twitter, if it...
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.300]   Why not?
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.560]   Were you on your iPhone?
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.560]   Yeah, of course.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.880]   I give the marriage six months.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.480]   Six months tops.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.120]   Six months tops.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.040]   What did Alexander, your lovely bride, think?
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.600]   She said put away the phone.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.720]   Well, you're getting married now.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.760]   Yeah, I think he was fine as long as I didn't have the phone go off in the middle of it.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   That would be fairly...
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.800]   That's my ringtone.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.600]   In the middle of the chapel, that probably would be very appropriate.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.800]   So this was in the news.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.040]   Is that what you're telling us?
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.480]   No, I just couldn't resist.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.560]   Well, what's the news story that was about...
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.800]   Oh, though, you wanted the earthquake news story?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800]   Is that what...
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.360]   No, the one you said that you and...
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360]   Oh, there's...
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.000]   It's not in the news, but I want to know about this, Will.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.560]   So Will did an interview with me here in the studio when you were in town a month ago,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.200]   which is now on the front page of channelflip.com.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.120]   And you were interviewing a bunch of tech luminaries in their jammies.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.920]   Is mine the first?
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.080]   Yours is the first.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.200]   And then you're going to have a lot of other people in their jammies.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.320]   Oh, this is out of that.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   So wait a minute.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   Now here's the problem.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   This is what upsets me.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.640]   I should get Kevin Rose on.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.520]   So somebody put it on dig, right?
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.040]   It got banned.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.200]   So it got like maybe 400 digs.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.320]   And by 400 digs, it still hadn't hit the front page of dig, right?
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.600]   Which as you know, it intakes like maybe 200.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.760]   Yeah, that's weird.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.880]   Popular get something.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.560]   And then I noticed it had been removed from the upcoming stories.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.440]   And so I emailed dig support and I was like, "Hey, how come this story isn't appearing
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.000]   anywhere on the site whatsoever?"
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.800]   And they were like, "Oh, it got buried."
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.880]   And I was like, "Well, why did it get buried?
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.840]   It's like, you know, it's a perfectly legitimate story.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.400]   It's this interview with Leo Leoport.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   The description does what it says on the tin.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.920]   It's not misleading, you know, blah, blah, blah."
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.200]   And like, "Oh, that's just the decision of the dig community.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.720]   And we're not going to overturn that."
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:01.880]   And I was like, "Well, how many people burying it does it take when 400 people have dug it
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.040]   and said it's really cool?"
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.360]   And they're like, "Oh, we don't give that away.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.640]   That's proprietary information."
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.520]   Five, probably.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   And I thought that's really lame.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.000]   This is a really good interview with somebody that's...
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   People love it.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I just get to tell my blog.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I tweeted about it.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And people loved it.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   It was very funny.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.800]   I don't see any reason that's a dig.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.320]   It sucks that like, you know, 10 people on dig who are just, you know, the haters can
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.640]   just pull it off the front page.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.960]   And there's no resource for it.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.960]   Those haters.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.960]   Well, are they...
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.520]   The question is, are they channel flip haters or are they Leo haters?
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.280]   Because I'm going to take this personally.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   I don't think there's enough people that reach channel flip for that to be channel flip
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.280]   haters as well.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.480]   So as people like me, it was about me.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.480]   I guess it's just people...
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.520]   No, maybe it's about the jammers for all, you know.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.600]   No, I was wearing a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.320]   I thought I was quite distinguished looking at it.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.000]   Oh, maybe that was the reason it was banned.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   You're encouraging smoking.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.240]   There was no tobacco and I was sucking on the thing.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.440]   Well, I was the same thing.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.880]   I thought it was a very good interview.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   I thought it was funny.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880]   Well, I think it is.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.640]   And I would encourage anybody listening to Twit to head over to channelflip.com and watch
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.640]   it.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.640]   And there's going to be more this week.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.560]   I got, you know, some hilarious ones.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:09.040]   There's a great one of Irina Slutsky and Violet Blue and Ryan Block and Tom and Molly,
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.680]   the legendary Molly interview.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   Can't wait.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.600]   The tattoo and tongue piercing interview.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.720]   Oh, that's hot.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.080]   Here's a story.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.640]   I love this.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.960]   Scientists are looking for volunteers to monitor quakes using the accelerometers in their
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   laptops.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.320]   Turns out that, you know, most laptops now, just like the iPhone have accelerometers
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.800]   built into them, mostly it's to protect you against when the laptop falls so the hard drive
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:45.520]   can, you know, suck its head into the shell before it hits the ground.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.760]   These accelerometers, it turns out, are sensitive enough to be seismographs.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.200]   So volunteers will be downloading software that links their computers to others in the
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.280]   network.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.040]   And then it gives them seismograph points all over.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.200]   They're looking for much in California.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:06.040]   In fact, the system was up during July, during that 5.4 earthquake.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.160]   We actually were doing security now at the time.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.720]   And I can see Steve Gibson and the whole thing was shaking around him.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.920]   And so they got about half a dozen laptops with the software on it.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.840]   Unfortunately, only three sent back signals.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.640]   They're working on it.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.480]   It's not so bad a dead end story.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.520]   This is just that was the first thing.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.800]   It's even unbelievable, doesn't it?
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.560]   It just seems like it like that shouldn't be possible.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:36.280]   Like that's it's just such an epic story that you can measure, you know, earthquakes with
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.000]   just like the stuff built into class.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   It costs 70.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.280]   Look, the more seismic stations you have, the more you know about earthquakes.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.400]   You want to find out how fast it travels.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.840]   You want to fight helps you with the epicenter.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:51.120]   But also it helps you understand the process pre pre tremors, post tremors and so forth.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:58.200]   It's $70,000 to install a seismographic station and then 3000 a year to maintain it.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.040]   This is like SETI at home for earthquakes.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   I think this is a great idea.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.040]   The quake catchers.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   That's exactly it.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.000]   You should it should come, you know, they should do a deal with Dell or something and
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.800]   just set it up pre installed on every single Dell that goes out and think what a, you know,
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.240]   scientific resource that it be.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.480]   They have been amazingly Austin, but they're they about 300 people so far, 50 volunteers
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.000]   in California, but I would hope they expand that out.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.160]   I can get it.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:27.160]   It's the University of California, Riverside, and I'm looking to story in MSNBC that of
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.000]   course, and this really bugs me.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.760]   A lot of times on mainstream media covers tech, they don't do the most basic thing, which
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.520]   is give you the gosh darn link.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.000]   I know it drove.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.200]   I find that amazing.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.040]   I was reading a story the day where it was a story, I think it was maybe like the time.com
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.520]   website, which was about other websites.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.680]   Yeah, like this website's really good for this.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   I hate that.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   And then I'll tell you what, haven't they?
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.160]   So just guess.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.120]   Anyway, I don't know if they're still looking for volunteers as you see Riverside.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.560]   If we find a link, we'll put in the show notes, but it's not in this MSNBC story.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.080]   So we didn't talk about this last week because I wanted to save it for John C. Devorak.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:13.760]   There are palens, Yahoo got breached because of this stupid system that Yahoo has for security
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.840]   questions.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.600]   So they, they were only, you know, if you forget your password and a lot of sites are
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.360]   using this now, and then I asked you a couple of security questions or questions where where
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.360]   did you meet your husband?
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.240]   Well, everybody knows she met Todd Palin in high school.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.160]   The guy tried a couple of different things.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.040]   Turned out it was Wasalia High School, where Wasalia High.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.680]   I can't remember what the other question was, but it was stuff that was commonly known.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.480]   The guy gets into Palin's email account.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.800]   By the way, they think they suspect one of the suspects is the son of a Tennessee state
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.400]   representative made his father proud.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.880]   They asked that he said, I don't know how to do that.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.920]   It's way beyond me.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:59.000]   So the point being made now is that you should probably not use, well, if you're going to
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.720]   use these certain standard security questions, why about the answer?
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.640]   You use your mother's mother's maiden name or your dog's name, maybe, especially if you're
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.520]   a public figure, but anybody, you know, this is probably pretty easy to guess.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.040]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.480]   It's a really lame and they should at least make you register like a secondary email address
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.520]   that they'll then email your password to, right?
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520]   That at least.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.640]   But again, it's convenience versus security.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.360]   The University of California, Berkeley doctoral student and security researcher Ariel Rabkin
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.560]   said, this is an attack.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.600]   Any 17 year old in America could do.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.600]   You could do it.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:41.080]   You could do it in your living room, drunk on the spur of the moment.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.480]   So I like this article in Time Magazine.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.400]   They quote, I'm a virgin America's questions.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.360]   Like some of them are one of them is how much wood would a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.560]   could chuck wood and you just make up the answer?
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.560]   I think that's a better idea.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.160]   But then you have to remember it.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.440]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.400]   So go check your messages, Leo, on the Skype.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.240]   Oh, would you like to go cook some roast?
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.040]   No, no, I'm just saying.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.520]   I thought I can come on for a minute.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520]   What's in vitamin?
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.760]   Adam Curry, the pod father.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.440]   I don't even know if I have a CG for him.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.280]   I'll have to make a new CG.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.720]   Oh, just use of, you know, I don't think he'll be back.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   Steve Gilmore.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.920]   Yeah, you do that.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.920]   Let's see.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.160]   All right, what else we got in the news here?
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.000]   I'm calling the pod father, but let's move on to other stories in the news.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.840]   Hey, there he is, the pod father himself.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.600]   Adam Curry, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   Hey, Leo.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   How are you?
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   I'm good, man.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   How are you?
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.600]   Where are you?
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.600]   In San Francisco.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   Oh, you're in our neck of the woods.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.160]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.080]   What brings you out here?
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.320]   I'm out here for a couple of weeks.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.520]   Headquarter stationed out here and really just to have John taking you to fancy dinners
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.760]   and buy me, well, no, select for me.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.760]   Lovely wine.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.960]   Yeah, I think you're buying the wine, Adam.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   I hate to tell you.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.960]   You bet.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.520]   You know, I don't buy expensive wine.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.320]   You get gems, John.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.480]   It's like those little Easter eggs at Costco.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.720]   Yeah, that's the last time he was on.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.200]   He explained how to do that at Costco.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.720]   There's a lot of good stuff because it's a gem.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.560]   Well, that was just one extreme.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   That's the high end.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.040]   Most of the good wine at Costco is like nine or $10.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.600]   So Jamie Thomas' trial got thrown out.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.080]   Miss trial declared.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:44.840]   Jamie is the single mom from Rainard, Minnesota, who was fined $222,000 for using Kazaa.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.640]   24 songs.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.520]   The jury found her guilty and find her the statutory fine, which is some astronomical
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.520]   amount.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.320]   Ended up being almost a quarter of a million dollars.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.760]   She appealed, lost in her appeal, but the judge said, "Wait a minute.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.600]   I screwed up."
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:09.120]   He had told the jury that it was not necessary for the recording industry to prove that anybody
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.720]   had downloaded the songs.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.480]   It was merely sufficient to make those songs available online.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.840]   That was sufficient.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.040]   The judge had said, "Hey, that's what the recording industry told me, but I looked into
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.840]   it and I was wrong.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.600]   So now they're going to go back to trial."
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.320]   I love the way the judge only questions what the recording industry told him, like after
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.320]   the trial.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.440]   It's like, "That's maybe one to look at when you're in the middle of this."
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.920]   They told me it was okay.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:41.240]   So I guess they're going to have another trial, but the recording industry says, "We can't
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.800]   prove that actual transfers happened."
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.680]   Say Jamie Thomas could well escape her quarter of a million.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   She could.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   She should anyway.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   This is bogus.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   Calling 24 songs.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.480]   Now, I mean, 10 times.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.560]   Did she look like a song pirate to you?
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.560]   No.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.400]   Well, she's a single mom.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   I mean, she wasn't.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   Here's what she did.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.200]   She did with a lot of people that she installed.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.560]   Kazah downloaded some songs.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:15.600]   The default install, and almost all peer-to-peer file sharing systems is the stuff you download
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.240]   is then made available.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.960]   That's how they work.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960]   She didn't pay any attention.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.040]   Nobody does.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.840]   And so she was offering songs.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.640]   Anything she downloaded was automatically offered to anybody else who wanted to download
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   it.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.640]   That's called peer-to-peer.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   It's against her will.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.840]   They made her do it.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.360]   Adam, how do you feel about this kind of thing?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.680]   You don't have to put up with this in Britain, do you?
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.400]   Oh, are you kidding me?
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.600]   They're now even installing filtering mechanisms at the ISPs' headends to make sure that we
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.040]   don't download or upload anything legally.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.400]   This is a real problem.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   It's getting worse.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.920]   If anything, I have an 18-year-old daughter.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.120]   And I had to explain to her because they don't teach us in school.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120]   What copyright is it?
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.120]   What do you tell her?
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.360]   Do you say, "Honey, this is what I tell my 16-year-old."
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.200]   I said, "Here's your-- I give you a $20 a month allowance.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.840]   That's two CDs a month.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.040]   You have to buy your music.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.480]   You're not allowed to download it."
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.960]   And every time I go to the Mac LimeWire is installed every time.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.240]   Well, I tried to explain the concept.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:22.280]   She has a part-time job, and she does buy songs off of iTunes.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.560]   But the real understanding of what is theft and what is property and what is intellectual
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.600]   property is not something you explain to someone who's never dealt with these concepts
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.000]   and has never been taught this in school.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.800]   You don't explain that in 10 minutes.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.600]   So I usually resort to, "Do you want the internet to be shut off?
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.800]   Because we're only going to get two warnings and the third strike, we're out.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.720]   And we won't be able to get any more connection.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.880]   Goodbye, Facebook."
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.440]   I use puppets, Adam.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.920]   I find that's very handy.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   Hello.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   I'm the recording industry.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.320]   And I'm a "Gammie Thomas."
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.880]   But clearly, the whole idea behind these lawsuits with these outrageous amounts is to
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.120]   set an example and to scare people in the submission.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.800]   And that's clearly not working because the people who are doing this, which is predominantly
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:16.760]   I would have to say young people who have no concept of it and really they don't understand.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.440]   And they're not being exposed to what the potential dangers are or it's not being perceived
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.920]   by them as a danger.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.520]   Adam, do you have the ethical conversation, though?
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.040]   Yeah, of course I do.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.920]   So you say it's wrong to do this?
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.560]   Oh, but I have this all the time with my wife, too.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.120]   She had a cosmetics company and I would have this conversation all the time because she
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.680]   would go down to Canal Street in New York City when it was still kind of what it was
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   back in the day.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   It's changed a lot.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   And she'd say, "Oh, look at all these knockoffs.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   I love this.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.680]   I can have 20 bags."
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.840]   And I'd be like, "Yeah, that's kind of funny, but what if people start knocking your stuff
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   off?"
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   Well, that's different.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.240]   I have a $20 Rolex that's made in Geneva with a J, by the way.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.240]   It's a great watch.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   Twenty bucks.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.520]   I got it on Canal Street.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.520]   No, I did a difficult course.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.040]   That came back to bite me in the butt because now she's buying real deal.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.880]   Oh, yeah, that was smart.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.680]   I love Kate Spade.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:17.440]   During those old, olden days, I collected a lot of those counterfeit watches and I'm
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.120]   actually, you know, I can tell a counterfeit watch a mile away from it.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120]   They're cheesy.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.120]   They don't look real.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.120]   No, no, actually, that's not totally true.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.120]   They're really good ones.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.800]   They're quite nice and they're not cheesy, in fact.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   They actually run on the wind, John.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   The way you tell.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.280]   They work because they're courts and that's right because they're...
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.920]   No, no, no, that's usually a wrong on that too because the fact of the matter is you can
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:42.440]   get a self-winding old-fashioned movement in a lot of these counterfeit watches if you
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   want to pay for them.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.440]   Those aren't...
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.080]   You're not going to get that for $20, by the way, which the real price is $14.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.680]   Oh, you mean I got ripped off?
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.480]   Did you get on Canal Street or off Canal Street?
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.720]   No, actually, I spent $10.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.400]   They have that tray of watches that says 10 and I just...
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.560]   I'd never go more than 10.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.200]   That's why I said Geneva with a J. If I'd spent $20.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   Yeah, no, what you want to do is you want to collect the watches that don't exist in
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:15.680]   the reality and the one that my absolute favorite one is a Movado, a perfect Movado,
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:22.920]   but it's silver on silver and they never made a silver watch and it's actually quite
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   attractive.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:30.240]   But anyway, there's another article to get off this topic, but since we're talking a
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.200]   little bit about copyrights and I didn't see it on the run down here, but I just sent
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.560]   you a link about which this is the only article that has me disturbed this week, which is
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:45.600]   the electronic frontier foundation suing the office of the US trade representative over
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.560]   information withholding on the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.840]   Is this that weird act of thing that Canada was going to enforce?
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.760]   Proposals include having customs officers report directly to private businesses and
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.520]   potentially giving border control staff the right to search media players and computers
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.520]   for pirated material.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.640]   Now, we've talked a little bit about this before.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.360]   What is the status of this?
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.160]   There's still haven't got the documents.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.000]   We don't know what's in this paperwork.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   So the...
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.520]   On October 2007, the US, the European community, Switzerland and Japan simultaneously announced
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:26.840]   a new intellectual property enforcement treaty, the ACTA, anti-counterfeiting trade agreement.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.360]   Australia, Korea, New Zealand, Mexico, Jordan, Morocco, Singapore, UAE and Canada have joined
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.920]   the negotiations.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:43.360]   And this is among the things proposed by ACTA is that basically customs agents become enforcement
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.920]   agents for intellectual property and without any oversight.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   Which is crazy.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:55.600]   The EFF says, "Acta raises serious concerns for citizens, civil liberties and privacy rights.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.040]   The treaty could potentially change your way.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.240]   Your computer is searched at the border.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.920]   People need to see the full text of act analysis that they can invalidate the impact and express
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.600]   their opinion to political leaders.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.320]   Instead the US trade representative is keeping us in the dark."
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   Here's the irony.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   Here's the irony.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.160]   I mean, Canada is proposing this, but it's coming from United States.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.960]   It's coming from the US record companies and movie industry.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   Yeah, of course.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.200]   A US wants to implement it though, of course.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.000]   And what'll happen is you go through the border, but this is already, we talked about
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   this a few months ago.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.160]   This is already happening.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.360]   You've got your iPod, you've got your laptop.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.200]   Customs agents would have the right to say, "I'd like to see what's on your laptop, please.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.040]   I'd like to see what's in your iPod, please."
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.240]   And then solely in their own discretion.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.040]   Do we know that this has ever happened to?
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.120]   Well, I've not happened to anybody because they don't have the powers yet.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.120]   This is the proposal.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   Whoa.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.920]   I'd like to point out that the custom border protection agency, which I know a lot about
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.640]   because I deal with them every single time I come into the country, they absolutely have
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.880]   the authority to do this already.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   I think so, yeah.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.800]   You're not in the country yet.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.880]   So you are not officially let in.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.040]   They have the right to search anything just like they'd search any vessel, any container
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   of any kind.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   So yes, they do.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.960]   Can you add them, say, "I'm not going to let you to search me.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.560]   I'm just going to turn around and go back."
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.640]   Or are you kind of their prisoner at that point?
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.720]   That's a good point.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.880]   I've never tried that one.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   I think you've got to try that, Adam.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.520]   I've got a first class ticket here.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.200]   I've got to return it leaves in 15 minutes.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200]   I've got to go.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   See it.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.400]   I get stopped.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.760]   Have they ever looked at your laptop or your iPod or anything like that?
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:37.200]   They've made me open my laptop and they kind of like look through it.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.680]   I've seen them open it just to say it's prove it's a laptop.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.640]   I've been having done that to me in a long time.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.600]   Are you saying they actually look at the files?
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.920]   I go through secondary and sometimes tertiary screening.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.480]   Well, you look like a terrorist.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.280]   There you go.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.240]   You look like a bad-ear-mine-off gang type.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.200]   I'll tell you what's more offensive is holding a US passport which I've had from birth.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.680]   But living in another country.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.240]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   I'll tell you.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240]   I'm out.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   You live in another country.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   The sorts, yes.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   The United Kingdom.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.800]   Ah, please step aside.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.600]   Don't you love us.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.240]   Why are you living somewhere else?
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   I'm more offensive.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   I'm more offensive.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   I have to prove what company I work for.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.760]   I have to prove with business cards.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.640]   It's really an offensive procedure.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.480]   Wait, Adam.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.720]   Why don't you at least explain why?
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.800]   Because the fact of the matter is he has this exact same name as some guy they're after.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.360]   Oh, is that true really?
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.320]   Yes, some evil Adam Curry from Nebraska.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.480]   You're kidding.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   No.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.480]   Is he out kind of?
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.120]   What's the...
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.120]   They wouldn't tell me...
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.880]   I got a lot of information over the past 10 or 11 times this has happened.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   Oh, my God.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   Essentially, I'm a match.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.120]   They match by first name, last name, and then they do birth date.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.120]   But if they get first name, last name, you're a match and you're pulled aside.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.640]   Apparently, the agency, because I said, "Why don't you pick this guy up in Nebraska and
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.160]   then get me the hell off the list?"
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.760]   I said, "Well, the thing is they're watching it, so I don't know."
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.760]   Wow.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.840]   Well, you know, there's one name that's like Robert Johnson or some really common name
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.880]   they talk about this and all these talk shows that bring this up.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   And it's like there's like thousands and thousands and thousands of these people that
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.240]   are stopped because they have this actually really common name that's on the list.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   And it's like...
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   This is not a no-fly list.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.400]   He's actually, you know, traveling under his name.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.560]   If he's like an alcated terrorist, he's on a watch list.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.760]   He's not traveling as Robert Johnson, surely.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   That's like that question.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   Are you carrying a bomb?
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.760]   Do you...
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.760]   It's like, yeah, I am.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.640]   But hold on, this is one big misconception.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.200]   This is not about the no-fly list.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.400]   It's very different from entering the border.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.000]   That's where I run into my problem.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.680]   So it's actually the border protection agency has nothing to do with the TSA and being allowed
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.680]   to...
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   It's another list.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.640]   It's another list.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.200]   The fact that the no-fly list is worse.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.760]   Well, anyway...
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   You can't fly.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.840]   You wouldn't even be coming over here if you're on the no-fly list.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.480]   What's the current status on ACTA?
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.800]   I'm glad the EFF has raised this issue.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.960]   So the current status is that the US trade representative is discussing it along with
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.240]   all the other countries and may or may not implement it at some point in the future.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.080]   But nobody knows because the USTR won't actually talk to anybody about it at all.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.520]   Well, that's the real problem with all this stuff is that the secrecy around it.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.440]   You don't know what they can and can't do.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.280]   You don't know what they will do and they won't tell you if you're on a list.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:40.120]   I mean, the whole thing is you're just not your persona non-grata.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.160]   And that's a little scary, the idea that the border agents would have absolute authority
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.600]   to say, "Look at something on your iPod and say, "We think that's pirated."
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   And take it.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.600]   Take the iPod.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.800]   This has never happened to anybody.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.000]   Yes, it has.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   No.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Who?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.440]   Well, there's one case.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.080]   I heard the last time we talked about it, I heard from some people that it happened to.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   You're right.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   I think it's still very rare.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.720]   There is one case that went to court where a fella crossing, I think, from Canada into
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.040]   the US, they opened his laptop.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.000]   They found what they thought, file names that sounded to them like child porn.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.680]   They were encrypted.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.320]   They said, "We want the password because we need to see what these are."
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.680]   He said, "No."
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.920]   They said, "You're under arrest."
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920]   They brought him to trial.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.040]   The judge, this is why I know about this, is a very important precedent that happened
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.440]   last year, the judge said, "No, he doesn't have to give you his password.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.440]   That's protected.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.440]   He's okay."
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.440]   That's the man.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   They let him go.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.760]   That's right.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.560]   That is a well-known case.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.360]   Why they happen to look at this guy's files?
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.080]   Maybe he was on a list, maybe they thought he was ... Maybe there was something suspicious
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   about him.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.080]   Maybe he was naked.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   I don't know.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   But the point is they sometimes do do this.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.360]   I don't know how often they do it.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.080]   Have we missed so far the Android phone this week?
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   That's this week, right?
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   Yes.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   I ordered the Android phone.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   I've ordered it.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   October 22nd.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   I am a T-Mobile cut.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   What are you laughing at?
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.080]   You're a joiner.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   You're a joiner.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.800]   I would guess you'd have one on order before anybody else.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.400]   I also called Google and I said, "Can I get a review unit?"
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   They said, "Yeah, we'll get you one."
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.160]   So I'm going to have one in the next couple of weeks.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.760]   You know, I never thought.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.440]   I'm going to have to get one.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.840]   Did you read my article in this week's MarkoWatch?
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.840]   No.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.560]   Of course, you didn't.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.360]   Nobody reads my stuff that does these shows with me.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   What was your article about?
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.520]   So I talked about the platform shift and it being these phones.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.840]   I agree.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:42.280]   I had a kind of a very interesting argument about it and I realized that because Microsoft
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:48.600]   was the first people out with the smartphone, they never got it right.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.200]   They were just essentially shrinking the PC and it wasn't a truth platform.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   Exactly.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.240]   So what we have now as a true platform shift, but it's not shifting.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.560]   I mean, we're not going to lose PC.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.840]   It's just going to be a new platform.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.240]   Although I think you make an excellent point, which is that internet access will shift to
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.840]   these portable devices.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.480]   Yes.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:14.960]   But the thing that's that kind of, you can try at them again, that why is it sending
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.320]   you these notes?
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.640]   So the thing that interested me in the one thing I finally got kind of clear on was the
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:26.680]   fact that in the most interesting aspect is that Google picked it up and they didn't
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.320]   get the idea before anybody else.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.720]   Well, but I mean, what was once they saw what Steve Jobs did, they got it.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.560]   They were on top of it.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.560]   Nobody else.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.640]   Now, I'm an iPhone user, but here's the reason I ordered the Android and I'm excited about
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.120]   it in stark contrast to the iPhone.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.040]   It's an open platform.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.400]   So the problem I'm having, I'm starting to have with the iPhone, I'm starting to get
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:54.840]   very upset with Apple, is there completely random choices of what applications to allow
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.760]   and what not to allow.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.400]   And it's clearly not an open platform.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.840]   It's much more like the sidekick where only the team mobile, you know, powers it be would
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.040]   tell you whether you could sell an application on the sidekick.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.600]   Here's the problem with the, with, or rather an issue that they're going to have to look
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.520]   at with the open sort of platform for Android, which is that they're, they're saying that,
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:18.160]   you know, there are going to be certain restrictions like you can't have a, an application that
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.720]   acts as a tethering to your laptop and you can't have applications.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.600]   Yeah, because team mobile has historically been, whoa.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.000]   Sorry, that was my new guy.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.760]   I'm back.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   And he's angry.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.960]   You know, the team mobile doesn't want people using their androids as well.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.960]   That's to the device.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.240]   You know, it's funny because team mobile is, but how are they going to stop that if it's
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   an open platform with?
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.080]   Let's just go back up a minute.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.800]   No, you can't stop it if it's an open platform.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.360]   What is T-Mobile's problem?
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.360]   They don't want.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.400]   T-Mobile's problem is that they don't want people using laptop like internet usage because
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.600]   if you're on a laptop, you're going to use a lot more data than if you're on a mobile.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   They're offering a very cheap, like, they don't want you using the phone.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.400]   As a internet connection, is that what they're doing?
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   Not with a laptop because they want you to pay extra for the laptop dongle.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.960]   But I have to say, a couple of things.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.920]   First of all, they didn't have a one gigabyte limit on this.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.280]   They've raised that, but it's still going to be a fairly low limit.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.920]   In most cases, T-Mobile has very limited 3G.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.200]   In fact, they're aiming the Android at the 22 markets where they have 3G.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.920]   I could buy it here even though I don't have 3G, but on edge, who cares?
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.080]   I don't want to surf on the edge.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.800]   And I don't think they're going to be able to stop it.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.680]   You know, T-Mobile has historically been very open to this kind of thing.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.360]   I'm kind of surprised to hear that they want to do that.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   So let me tell you something we don't know.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.880]   Just on the, on the note about the platform shift.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.600]   Because I found this really, really interesting.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.080]   When I was on my, my honeymoon last week.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   I'll go again.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.880]   This is interesting.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.040]   So I didn't take my laptop with me, right?
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.160]   All I had was my iPhone.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.760]   And I discovered, and I had like the machine that was in like the hotel lobby.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.920]   So I discovered number one, we were out in the sticks in Italy.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.960]   There was no broadband.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.880]   The internet is now unusable on dial up.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   Just absolutely.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.800]   You can't do anything on dial up anywhere.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.360]   Just pretty much dial up of wireless.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   Right.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.040]   So, but what I found was that I had 3G service.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.920]   And this whole platform shift thing is a complete game changer.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.000]   Because I could do pretty much everything that I needed to on this phone.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.800]   I think the forex absolutely that.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.240]   I don't think you needed an iPhone to do that though, Patrick.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.800]   Well, what do you need?
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   Well, sorry.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.600]   Well, I made a conscious decision not to buy an iPhone.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.600]   Do you use an Nokia?
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   What do you use?
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.600]   Yeah, use the E71.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.360]   Well, that's a great smartphone though.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   That's a wonderful thing.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.840]   What they did is they finally got it right.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.560]   They put a powerful enough processor into actually make series 60 SIMD and work functionally.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.960]   And I do comparisons with people in the UK all the time.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.600]   I say, okay, show me your 3G.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:59.120]   And I show them how quickly the GPS fires up and actual driving instructions work.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.200]   It's got a 3.2 megapixel camera.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.120]   I installed the upper mini browser.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.400]   So I get a full view.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.800]   Nokia is supposed to be, the S60 browser is supposed to be pretty good though.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   It actually does.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   It does flash.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.280]   It does a whole bunch of things.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.000]   You know, I bet.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.080]   And by the way, John, as I said last night of dinner, I expect blowback on the iPhone
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.080]   as a platform.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.080]   I agree.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.080]   I don't see it.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.080]   I think blowback is coming.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.680]   Because it's not open.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   Because it's not open.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   And if Android.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   You can develop for SIMD.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.160]   You know, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   SIMD is a great platform.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.320]   By the way, it's also Java based.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.320]   So I think a lot of developers might do both because you're.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.800]   Just on that, what I do is I do have an iPod touch.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.480]   The first version and I installed a Joy-Coo spot on the Nokia.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.840]   And so I can just fire up and become an instant Wi-Fi spot for myself.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.800]   And I can keep that in my pocket.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.400]   I want to use the iPod touch browser, then it works perfectly.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.000]   What's the name of that program?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.200]   Joy-Coo Spot.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.200]   J-O-Y-K-U.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   J-O-I-K-U Spot.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   I think the problem with the--
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   That's cool.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.840]   That turns the phone, the S60 phone into a Wi-Fi-A station.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.840]   Wow.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.040]   And you carrier's not stopping that?
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.040]   No.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.240]   Not yet.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   You could do those.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   And I have T-Mobile.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.800]   So they haven't told me anything.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.480]   As far as they're concerned, I'm just using my phone to access the internet.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   I think one of the reasons T-Mobile might be nervous in the US with the Android phone
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.400]   is it's only $35 for unlimited internet and messages.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   Oh.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.920]   Yeah, there's got to be an asterisk next to the unlimited.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.560]   Yeah, one gigabyte was the initial asterisk, which is very much not one--
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.920]   Well, I'm going to be not the devil's advocate on this one.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   I'm going to say there's not going to be blowback on the Apple product.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.880]   I think it's going to take off and it's never going to slow down.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.000]   And I think it's mainly because of the applications that are going to be developed for it.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.480]   Some of them are unbelievable.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.560]   But those could all be developed on Android without any restrictions.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.200]   John, which one is unbelievable?
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   I'm not seeing--
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   What is the unbelievable?
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.560]   I'll give you a few unbelievables.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.720]   Explane, amazing.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.320]   Has not-- OK.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.520]   But you can--
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.040]   Is the interesting--
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.960]   You know, in this case, Adam, you're the old fart.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   Let me tell you--
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.960]   Finally.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.960]   You're right.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:15.960]   I'm starting the blowback right here.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   I mean, I'm an Apple guy.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.960]   I love Apple.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   I got the first iPhone.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.120]   I got the iPod touch.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.440]   And I didn't-- I chose not to wait in line before my vacation in Guilford of all places.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.520]   There were 200 people outside of the O2 store.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.120]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.120]   And so I decided--
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.760]   Well, I'll pick up this E71.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.320]   And I've been extremely happy, certainly compared to the results other people are getting.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   So this massive beta testing--
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   I think beta testing--
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   Oh, beta testing.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.480]   beta testing-- I call it a failure of a platform.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   I don't think it's right.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.400]   Here's what I think we could all agree on, though, that this-- the idea of these phones
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.480]   is happening.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.960]   The iPhone started it.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.480]   I don't think it's going to be preeminent.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.640]   I'm very interested in what Google does with Android.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.960]   I think Nokia's always had a great platform.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.640]   I think you're going to see other stuff to the T-Mobile storm.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.000]   I'm sorry, the BlackBerry storm is going to be an amazing phone.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.840]   I think you're seeing a lot of these.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.960]   And Nokia is not tied into a network.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.960]   That's the whole thing.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   Apple is tied in--
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.960]   Unlocked key.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.640]   That's why you get that, OK, you can't have this application because it's going to piss
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.320]   off our network provider or whatever deal we have.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.600]   You can go buy an unlocked Nokia phone.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.240]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   I'm kind of with that.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   I'm kind of with that.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.320]   I'm kind of with selling unlocked Apple iPhones today in Hong Kong.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   For use in?
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.880]   I'm kind of just saying that there's a big market.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.680]   I don't know whether you know this or not, but Hong Kong's kind of a big place.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.680]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.680]   I think that--
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.840]   John, you don't have an iPhone?
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   I know I use burners.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   Just shut up.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   Just shut up.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   He doesn't believe his microphones.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.840]   He doesn't know Jack crap about any of the Apple phones.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.840]   You're both both farts.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:44.840]   I mean, it comes.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.840]   So it's wanker stuff.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   There's nothing-- I don't think-- I've not seen any application of any of the--
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.480]   Here's the killer app.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.840]   Twitterific on an iPhone at the altar.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.840]   That's the killer app.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.840]   Right.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:02.000]   So what do you think about this idea that the iPhone is going to be what the sort of
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.280]   the original Mac was, the thing that spots all the trends does it all first but is ultimately
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.200]   killed by a platform for Apple.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.440]   Apple has a great, great history.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   Look at the Newton.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.600]   Apple has a great history of doing this.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.720]   The Newton loss to the palm.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.120]   The iPhone could very well lose to one of these other competitors.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.280]   I think if Apple keeps it closed-- I'm with Adam on this one.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.320]   I think Apple's made a big mistake by deciding to go with a single carrier and making a closed
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.320]   platform.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.120]   It's Steve Jobs and a power grab.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.040]   They're doing the iTunes thing.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.720]   It's going to fail with iTunes because the record labels are moving away from them with
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.720]   copy protection.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.960]   It's going to fail with the iPhone, not because it's not a great platform, but because it's
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.880]   closed if there's an open alternative people are going to go for it.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.240]   Apple has no history of being open, so why should they start now?
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   No, you're right.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.080]   I don't think it's that people even want it to be open.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   I think it's just certainly a lot of the-- as far as I can see, most of the blowback on
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.600]   it is coming from people like us who are the sort of high tech guys in the developer
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.920]   community who are so fed up of the fact they could develop an app for six months and it
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.040]   might not end up on the store.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.960]   Either Apple needs to go open or they need to be really, really, really clear about what
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.920]   they are going to allow and what they aren't going to allow on this.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.200]   That's not the biggest and some piece of guy.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.400]   It's just for functionality that this thing doesn't have out of the box.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   Why should I have to live without GPS turn-by-turn instructions in today's mobile world?
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.400]   That's ridiculous.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.400]   You can paste or voice styling or a dozen other features.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   Have you ever tried to enter a really secure Wi-Fi key into your iPhone?
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   Never.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.600]   Forget it.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.960]   I make all my passwords.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.400]   This is terrible, but in order for me to use the iPhone, I have to make all my passwords
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   really bad, lower case--
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   If you use a--
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.600]   How's it said, like a 64-bit key or whatever we use at the office?
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   Forget it.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   It's like 50 characters.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.600]   Come on.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   You can't do it.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.000]   And it was that a one, an L or a capital I?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.800]   I don't know what that is.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   It's horrible.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:00.000]   I think this is going to be a case where Apple is not going away.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   They're going to be a leader.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.200]   I think you're right, John, that consumers will go for the simplicity of the iPhone.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.320]   The advantage Apple has, same reasons consumers like iTunes.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.880]   It's the end-to-end simplicity of it that people like.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.040]   But I think it's very interesting.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.800]   Watch what T-BumbleMumble does with this App Store.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:23.080]   If they do this right, if Android is open and well-designed and you start seeing developers
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.960]   write software for developers who are spurned by Apple, I think this could be a very powerful
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   platform.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   How much do you see me?
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   It's great headsets.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:31.960]   How do you see which catch-up?
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.560]   They have so much-- right now I can get Audible on my Nokia phone.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   It has a little thing there.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.640]   And you download the app and then it understands the DRM, whatever's involved.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.400]   I mean, while the Apple has a lot to catch up, I'm going to rely on independent developers
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.880]   to do that makes no sense.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.000]   Well, I can listen to Audible on my iPhone also.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   That's not an issue.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.440]   So the other thing that's interesting I find about, you know, talking about the sort of
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.760]   iTunes and the iPhone competitiveness is the fact that Google's building in the Amazon
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.560]   MP3 store to this thing.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.520]   I really like to protect it.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.840]   Yes, I agree.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.840]   Well we won't know.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   I mean, look, I ordered one.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.480]   I'm going to have one for review.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   It's cheap enough.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.800]   You could buy one and see how it works because I could pop my T-Mobile SIM card into it.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.480]   I would love to see an unlocked version of this.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   But I think we will.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.480]   I think that's the thing.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.280]   And that's what you may not see for a long time from Apple in the US anyway.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.280]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   I want to talk more about this.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.560]   I agree with you, John, on the premise of your market watch column.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.880]   I'll talk a little bit more about that.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.600]   But before we do, I want to thank the folks at Visa.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   I just like to point out that the market watch column is actually not viewable on a
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   mobile device.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.400]   You're not even on the E71?
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.800]   It has all these weird pop-ups and stuff.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.440]   We were doing it last night at dinner.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.640]   It's like, how ironic is that?
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.600]   You've got to be careful with Opera Mini, you know, Adam, because it's caching everything,
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.840]   even your SSL pages.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.840]   It's not secure.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.240]   So don't use Opera Mini for banking, things like that.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.240]   Just for porn.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   Just for, great for porn.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.440]   How does, well, let's get to that.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.240]   We'll talk about how porn works on the E71 in just a moment.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.240]   But first, I want to...
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.240]   I want to send it back.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   I'll be right back.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.160]   You may all, you may all leave.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.000]   I'm going to mention our good friends at Visa.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.040]   This is our last Visa commercial.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.400]   We really had a great time with them.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.560]   We were so glad they were here.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.240]   The contract ran out at the end of September.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.240]   So we thank them.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.800]   We welcome them back anytime they'd like to come.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.080]   And remind everybody, when they go shopping, to take along your Visa card, Visa, make sure
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.960]   it's safe and secure online or off.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:33.040]   They use very sophisticated, real-time fraud monitoring software to keep an eye on things.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.120]   We've talked about this many times.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.200]   To keep an eye on fraudulent activity, so you are always safe.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.520]   Zero liability.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.480]   You're just not liable for unauthorized purchases.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.880]   Online and off, all the purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.560]   That's peace of mind.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.760]   Make sure when you go shopping, just remember this.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.880]   Take that Visa card out of your wallet.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.400]   Visa, safe, secure.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   We thank them.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.800]   All right, now I get it.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.720]   I've got to give them some credit for being safe and secure.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.280]   No problems, they're sure.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   It's Visa, Visa, Visa.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.800]   So I am actually, I'm a little jealous because I wanted to get that E71.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.880]   I was an N95 and if you looked at the N96 animal.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.320]   Yeah, I have, but I really want the full-quality keyboard.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.720]   The keyboard makes a difference and that's what I'm interested about with the Android
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.720]   phone.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.720]   It has a full keyboard.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.120]   The iPhone Touch keyboard is so difficult to use.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.120]   I like the E71.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:36.480]   I've always been a fan of S60 of Symbian since the Scion days.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   I love my Scion.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.320]   In fact, one of the things I'm kind of looking forward to with this Android phone, it feels
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.040]   to me like it might be a little bit like a Scion 3A.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.960]   I might just have a little bit of that.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   Oh, Madger.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.960]   Remember theirs?
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   Those are so good.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.360]   The little keyboard, there's like a laptop keyboard.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   Best PDA ever.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:59.240]   But the one thing, and I remember talking to the president of Scion, I said, "You got
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.560]   a sink to the desktop."
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.920]   And they said, "Nah, we don't think that."
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   And nobody really wants that.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.920]   It's like, "Oh!"
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   She's...
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.960]   What happened to Scion?
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.320]   It's S60, it's Symbian.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   And it's owned by...
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.960]   Does Nokia own it out right now or...?
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.360]   Yeah, they own it.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.960]   And I think they're good stewards of it.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   Why?
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.040]   I think it kicks ass.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   It's really gotten...
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:28.000]   Now with a faster processor, I had the E71i before this, the E61 before that.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.200]   And the processor was just too slow for it to really be snappy.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.280]   And that's when you held an iPhone for the first time, it's like, "Crikey, no, this
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   thing's flying."
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.880]   And now, the same thing...
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.640]   I do want to point out, though, that every single picture I've seen of the Android phones
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.440]   or whatever, can we all just agree that they're butt ugly?
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.760]   Oh, God, they look like Dell Axims or something.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   They're just clunky.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   It's not a...
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.920]   An insignificant part of Apple's success, this design form factor, etc.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.640]   They're going to appeal to the enthusiast.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:00.880]   This is clearly a phone for the enthusiast crowd that wants to have an open platform,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.640]   that wants a keyboard, that doesn't mind if it's clunky.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.400]   It doesn't want to get laid.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.320]   Basically, for people who really don't want to have sex anymore or never had it, more
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.000]   likely.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.080]   Just on that subject, you were talking of when you were the mobile porn.
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.800]   I was just looking after John's article on the...
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.440]   It's not the way to do the stuff.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   No, no, no.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.440]   Well, yeah.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:28.320]   On vnu.net.com, one of their top headlines is mobile video chat porn to explode.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.360]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.680]   Let me wrap my head around that.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.240]   Mobile video chat porn porn.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.560]   So adult chat.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.520]   And the whole article is absolutely...
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.360]   It's the most outrageously innuendo-filled article you can imagine.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:51.320]   Global revenues from mobile adult video chat are set to climax at one and a half billion.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.320]   Oh, please.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.960]   They've gone with 3G penetration expected to exceed 25%.
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   Oh, God.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:03.560]   And then just to top it all off, the byline is written by Guy Dixon.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.440]   Oh, please, Guy.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   Now, come on.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.880]   If you have a name like that, you probably...
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:13.120]   You were wounded at birth at childhood and you just have to live with it.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.120]   Good news.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:20.280]   Jack Thompson, the crusader against violence in video games, he's been barred, disbarred.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:23.160]   Permitantly disbarred as of October 25th.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   No longer could practice...
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   That makes me sad.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.160]   What?
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.240]   He was a good person to rail against, wasn't he?
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.120]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.560]   His heart was in the right place.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.440]   He was just a complete div about doing it.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.440]   What?
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.440]   Do you have that?
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.440]   A div?
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.600]   I think that's a CSS thing, isn't it?
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.400]   A div is like a pillock.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.400]   A pillock.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   Oh, well.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.040]   Adam, can you translate for us?
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.520]   I think you speak both English and American.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.680]   Yeah, I'm lost on this one too though.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.080]   We'd have another pint.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.000]   A pillock.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.960]   So I get the gist though.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.960]   I get the gist though.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.440]   I'll tell you, I will the word in it yet.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.520]   You might as well adjust a little bit.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.520]   Or putts.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.520]   Putts is good too.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.520]   That's what I'm looking for.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   So he had...
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:18.760]   Although he was clearly crazy and he was obviously sort of making a name for himself and you
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.760]   know, being a bit of a nuisance.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:25.160]   The fundamental premise of what he was saying was kind of not unreasonable.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:31.120]   He was just saying, look, video games that are, you know, designed for adults like Grand Theft
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:36.680]   Auto or like all the serial killer games like Manstool or whatever should not, you know,
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:40.000]   as a 12 year old or a 10 year old, you shouldn't be able to buy those and they shouldn't be
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   marketed to you.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Well, he's...
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   I might agree with him on that.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.680]   Well, he was a little more empat than that.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.200]   That's not outrageous.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   But the trouble is he wrapped it up in all this sensationalism and name grabbing and you
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.720]   know, trying to create a media career for himself.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.440]   That the message got lost in the craziness.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.880]   So it's sad that he's sort of the message has been vilified along with the man.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.720]   By the way, that's not why he was disbarred.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.480]   He was disbarred for ethics violations, public misconduct.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   He's appealed.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:12.720]   He's a seeking an emergency stay from the US District Court and published a press release
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.600]   that said the court's decision is quote, "In retaliation for his Tyndale House book, Out
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:23.400]   of Harm's Way," published in 2005, which blew the whistle on the Florida Supreme Court
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:28.720]   and their efforts in the '90s to literally pathologize his faith based and successful
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.040]   activism against the American entertainment industry.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.400]   Basically, they're apt to get him.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.040]   Yeah, that's kind of stupid, right?
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.600]   He was unlikely.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.640]   He's kind of a nutball.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:45.080]   But I just want to mention that all opinions on this week in tech are held by its individual
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.080]   people.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.080]   Don't sue the hell out of me.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.680]   Please, Jack, I don't mean it.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:49.680]   We love...
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.680]   What was that?
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   I don't know.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.680]   You couldn't sue the hell out of you anymore anyway.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.680]   No, I can.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   No, I can't.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.680]   Until October 25th.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:02.520]   And the video games are preparatory training for young boys when they go into battle.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.520]   Was that his...
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.520]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.520]   He...
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.520]   This guy would do...
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.520]   Let me see if I could find some of the high-ganging...
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.960]   I'd like to preparatory.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.600]   We should talk about that for a second.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.600]   Because that's what I do believe in.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.000]   I believe that a lot of this...
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Certainly the war games.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   It's the army doing this.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   It's not just the army.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.320]   John, what's the name of that company that we saw a poster for the other day in the city?
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   Right, right.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.320]   There's a protest going on.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.960]   That secretive gaming company.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:33.680]   There's a gaming company in South Park that wrote, I think, that army game that Leo mentioned.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   And there was going to be a big protest in front of the place.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.840]   Oh, that's San Francisco.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.680]   Just a bunch of hippies and...
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.680]   That's true.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:45.040]   Well, you've probably seen the mercenaries too commercial in the UK.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:50.160]   And when you look at that, it's like basically...
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:57.760]   It's filled with images of mercenaries who are blowing up oil rigs and there's helicopters.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:02.320]   And it's very close to reality, I feel.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.440]   And for my money...
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.840]   I'm not saying you can't for free speech as far as I'm concerned.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.320]   I can make whatever game they want.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:13.800]   But I'm not going to gloss over the fact that it totally prepares 13-year-old boys for
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.560]   the future of warfare, which is already what it is now.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:23.400]   It's killing people at a distance with drones and other long-range type of weaponry.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.080]   There's no real hand-to-hand combat anymore.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   It's just, get the coordinates, look at the screen, press the trigger.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.000]   So yeah, it's totally its training for these kids.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   No doubt about it.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   What the hell's wrong with that?
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Don't you want...
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   Don't you want...
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Are on silence.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   Don't you want an art?
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.880]   I mean, assuming that you need some form of national defense, don't you want kids to
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.840]   be good at it?
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.240]   Well, that's not an appropriate conversation to it because I could go on for a long time.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.280]   What I feel about that, I said, "We'll have nothing to do with technology."
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.480]   You're a pacifist?
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.080]   I don't believe in our boys and girls killing each other in deserts now.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.680]   Yeah, I'm kind of with you on that.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.680]   But at the same time, I could see how if you...
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:11.200]   Is not based on BS lies from our own government.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.680]   No, no, I don't believe in that.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.960]   Let's get back on track here.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:18.800]   John, I warned it.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.360]   I'm not adverse to that conversation.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.040]   Yeah, it was a political junkie which you would do really well.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.040]   Hold on a second.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.040]   DailySourcecode.com.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   There you go.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.800]   DailySourcecode, he'll talk about it.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.880]   But assuming the premise that you do...
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:38.320]   In this country anyway, we believe in having a national defense and having an army.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.840]   Is it so bad to offer games that...
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:46.080]   Look at John, you always said that driving games help your kids drive better.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:52.200]   Yeah, and the other thing, I believe that if my kids who both play all of them actually
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.560]   play Grand Theft Auto, I believe that if they ever go into car thievery, they're going
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.040]   to be getting good at it.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:05.640]   Okay, so have we got any updates on Yahoo buying AOL?
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.560]   I think that was a bogus rumor.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.760]   I think it was a bogus rumor.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.760]   Died.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.480]   You know, these things take a long time to fruition.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:18.160]   It's unlike these bank deals that we've been watching recently that happen overnight.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.160]   Most deals take a while.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.000]   I think there may still be something in the works.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.080]   Really?
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.000]   And what would Yahoo...
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   What part of AOL?
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.560]   Because this would be part of the kind of selling off of AOL.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.160]   They would take the online stuff.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.500]   I think it would be nice for them to get a hold of all of AOL's properties, including
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.500]   Netscape.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.840]   And then they can do the browser because somebody must be hounding them on the board level saying,
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.000]   "Hey, if Google's going to do a browser and look why they're going to do it because we
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.640]   all have all deconstructed everything Google's up to, we better do one too."
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.560]   Well, Netscape is open source.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.560]   Yeah, I mean, you just...
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.960]   No, no, but it's nice to have.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.880]   I know it's open source, but it's got all these...
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.040]   It is slightly restricted.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.600]   It's not like just every...
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.600]   You can't just do it.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.400]   You can't just write your own Firefox for Yahoo.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.400]   But they have...
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.400]   Like the team is there.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.880]   I mean, it's like whether it's open source or not, they have the code base.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.880]   They've got the people that code it that code, I think.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.720]   There are probably a few of them around the left that can code.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.640]   I mean, I just think that there's probably a few things.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.120]   There's probably a few Easter eggs within the AOL bundle that would make it worth their
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.120]   while.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.360]   It's about the ad networks that AOL has.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360]   That can be a...
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.840]   You have the ad networks that are quite powerful.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.200]   The whole thing of actual value that is, you know, constable, that's what it's about.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:42.280]   This started September 24th, about four days ago in the Financial Times citing an unnamed
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.360]   source familiar with the company.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.280]   Usually, that means the CEO.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:51.840]   The report says active negotiations are not taking place yet just that Yahoo could sit
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.840]   down to the table over the matter.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.520]   Why would you raise a trial balloon saying we might be willing to talk to you?
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.440]   Just to kind of scare off other buyers?
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.240]   What do you think, Adam?
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240]   Because you...
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.880]   To see maybe what the shareholders might...
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.600]   Why would anybody do that?
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.600]   Maybe they should get...
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.600]   Maybe engage the shareholder...
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.120]   I don't think it was a trial balloon.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.360]   I think AOL may be in very dire straits in many business areas and they probably are actually
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.520]   working on some kind of deal and it got out.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.080]   It doesn't sound like a trial balloon to me.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:27.360]   The decision according to this story was made at Carl Icahn's first board meeting.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360]   That new...
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360]   No, I knew Yahoo!
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360]   No, I knew Yahoo!
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.360]   Maybe Icahn's doing this.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   It could be.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.800]   Hey, what if we bought Yahoo!
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.840]   Let's just buy AOL!
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.840]   I believe it would, depending on the price, obviously, it would be a crater.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.400]   It's about the ad networks, plain and soon.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.680]   And of course, there's a lot of scrutiny now over the Google Yahoo deal, even federal
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.280]   scrutiny over this.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.280]   Same thing.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.800]   It's a products collusion.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.240]   We don't want monopoly.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.880]   You think it's a good idea that Yahoo!
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.680]   Be kind of working with Google on online ads?
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.080]   I don't think it's as big a deal as everyone makes it out to be.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.280]   I mean, it's a big, big money deal, but I don't think it's gonna...
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.280]   It's not even a big...
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   It's a hell of a business.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.880]   800 million big deal.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.120]   All right, coming up in just a bit.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.640]   Walmart pulls the plug on DRM and this could be a big deal if you own any music you bought
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.120]   in the Walmart store, all 12 of you.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120]   But first...
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   Ladies and...
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   It's just kidding, right?
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.120]   A lot of people bought online music at Walmart.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.920]   Walmart is the biggest music reseller in the...
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.160]   Yeah, but the physical media.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.680]   How many people bought...
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.080]   Who buys online from Walmart?
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.080]   I don't know.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.080]   That's a good question, not to mention it.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.760]   You might have me on that one, but I would be shocked if they didn't have a good...
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.080]   Well, they're gonna be shocked too in just a couple of weeks.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.240]   I'll tell you why.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:45.720]   But first, I want to mention the folks at Qualcomm and Gobi, the global mobile internet
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720]   from Qualcomm.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.440]   A lot of worldwide travelers on the show today, we know that much and you might want to take
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.040]   a look at Gobi.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.240]   I just ordered a Toughbook with Gobi built in.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.560]   It's the wireless network card from Qualcomm.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.320]   A lot of the notebook manufacturers are using these that allow you to access multiple wireless
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   carriers.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.960]   So as you travel, you can change.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.320]   You can be HSDPA in one country, EVDO in another country.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320]   It's built in.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.560]   It doesn't stick off the edge so you don't break it or lose it.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.440]   You just have multiple SIM cards, Leo.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.880]   How does that work?
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.880]   I don't know.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.160]   It's hardware in the laptop and I presume with software you would say, "Okay, today in the
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.520]   States I'm going to be Verizon, I'll be O2 in England."
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:33.400]   So it's great for corporate network managers with one device, multiple carrier support.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.000]   The world is your hotspot is there.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.280]   I think it's a really good idea.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.560]   I haven't tried it yet.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.280]   I've asked for a Gobi notebook so we can give it a try.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.320]   If you want to find out more, go be G-O-B-I, like the desert.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.520]   Gobeanywhere.com/devices.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.280]   G-O-B-I Anywhere.com.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:55.120]   And you can also subscribe at that page to a RSS feed so that when there is a new Gobi
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.320]   notebook from a manufacturer, they'll let you know.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.840]   So Qualcomm and Gobi, I think this is about time.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:06.680]   I've been using a single card, USB or MPCI cards you put in there.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.560]   The idea that's built in the laptop is great and the idea that it would work with multiple
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.120]   carriers.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.680]   So, I'll allow you.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.160]   That's G-O-B-I, gobeanywhere.com/devices.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.680]   We thank you so much for their support on this week in tech.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.920]   I think Panasonic announced two new Toughbooks including an ultra light that looks really
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.040]   interesting.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:34.840]   So Walmart stopped selling copy protected music.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.720]   The last time they saw that was in February, they started selling copy protection free
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.400]   music last year and they went all copy protection free just like everybody else around February.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.980]   However, if you bought WMA music, Windows Media Music protected by plays for sure on
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:55.120]   Walmart store, you might want to convert it to CD.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:01.760]   Walmart sent out a notice saying we're going to shut down the DRM servers in just a couple
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.280]   of weeks.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.280]   So burn them.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:11.840]   They're saying burn, we're not going to give you October 9th, the servers will shut down
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.160]   and if you for any reason have to reinstall Windows or Windows crashes on you or you want
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.840]   to move into another machine, you won't be able to and you'll never be able to play that
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.440]   track again.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.760]   And you won't be able to burn them in CD until unless you do it before October 9th.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.440]   You know this is cloud computing at its finest.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.640]   No, it's DRM, John.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.480]   It's cloud computing.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.160]   Well, you are reliant.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.400]   I guess the analogy is you're reliant on a server in the cloud to allow you to play this
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.280]   music.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.440]   This is my complaint about cloud computing in general.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.440]   This is the email from Walmart.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.520]   Quote, "If you have purchased protected WMA music files from our site prior to February
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:07:00.200]   2008, we strongly recommend you back up your songs by burning them to a recordable audio
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:05.240]   CD by backing up your songs, you'll be able to access them from any personal computer.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.560]   But once that server's turned off, you won't be able to do it.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.560]   So do it now."
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.560]   You're so right, John, when you say that's the essence of cloud computing.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.480]   So, you two agree.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.960]   You don't like cloud computing.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.800]   Not for a not for mission critical or certain mission critical activities.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.360]   What John's probably going to say is it does have its place, but yeah, not for stuff that
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.040]   you actually care about.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040]   Like my email?
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.040]   Do you use Gmail?
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040]   Well, that's cloud computing.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040]   Yeah, it's cloud computing.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.040]   That's cloud computing.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.040]   Isn't that what it is?
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.560]   I'm not saying I don't use it.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.040]   Well, isn't that mission critical?
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.480]   Yes, it's mission critical.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.840]   But in Gmail's case, it may go down once or twice.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.520]   I have pretty good confidence in that company.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.040]   And yeah, I use iTunes.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040]   So that's cloud computing?
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.440]   So choose your provider carefully.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.240]   Well, let's see even more.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.040]   I think it's more complicated than that.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.760]   Google, I still have even a problem with the Gmail.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:06.760]   I mean, I use Mark Perkel's operation to do my mail.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.120]   We just do it and he does it himself.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.560]   That's cloud computing, John.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.720]   It's cloud computing, but I don't have to worry, for example.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.680]   It's less anonymous because it's more like a small business versus a large corporation
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.680]   when you deal with Google.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680]   Well, that's more reliable.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.240]   No, no, let me finish.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.840]   And what I'm saying is that at some point, if to Google or any large company that does
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.560]   something like this decides that they don't want you anymore or that you violated one
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:36.160]   of their policies and you don't really have any recourse, you could easily be booted off
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.920]   your and lose all your email.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.960]   If you're working with a small company where you know the guy personally, which is the
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.800]   way I could call him in a while.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.600]   At the end of the day, you also have the ultimate control over the cloud computing,
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.840]   hopefully, with whatever your MX record is set to on your domain name.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.040]   So I make backups of what I have on Gmail.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040]   I don't trust it.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   I mean, that's the key.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.400]   What if you add Google gears or something like that, some sort of persistent store so
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.000]   that you get the best of both worlds?
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.280]   When you're offline, you still can work on the documents.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.760]   All the documents are still there.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.520]   But when you go online, they're migrated up, they're synced up with the cloud.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.600]   And if you're on another computer, you have access to everything, that's what modern cloud
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   computing is.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.240]   And I think that that's an incredible convenience without risking your data.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.560]   And by the way, the biggest cloud computing fiasco is happening around us, which is the
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.400]   financial system.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.320]   That's cloud computing?
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.320]   Absolutely.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.480]   You better explain it.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.960]   Nobody's given anybody any.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.280]   I mean, there's all monies all in the cloud.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.720]   It's imaginary money.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.720]   Hell yeah.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.400]   Well, kinda.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.720]   So let's get back to the what your description was of the cloud computing model that you
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.720]   thought was okay.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.600]   That is not the same as the thin client model that all these guys keep promoting.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.600]   You can't do that.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600]   But yeah, I agree.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.520]   But this is not what Google is promoting, for instance.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.840]   Google Gears is a great addition to Firefox where you just, and Chrome where you just,
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.680]   you know, it's persistent.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.840]   And I think anybody who like Adam who uses Gmail is prudent absolutely to make a copy
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.800]   of everything somewhere.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.200]   And by the way, I've been doing that for 15 years.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.560]   I've been backing up my email.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.960]   I don't think I've ever, ever, ever, ever had to go back and find something.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960]   I wonder why I do it.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.160]   You just, well, you're being, you're being.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.320]   That's not true.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.800]   I don't believe that.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.920]   Yeah, it is.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   I use I'm.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.720]   I still have to once it doesn't happen too much.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.760]   And here's what here's my, I have also backed up all my email, but, and unfortunately, if
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.000]   it's on, it's on different systems, because I keep blowing up these systems because they
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.840]   can't handle all those email.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.440]   So I have all these different, like I have to boot up like an old Mozilla mail browser
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.640]   and I have to back, I have to boot up an old outlook.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.400]   And then I even have some old, you door files.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.320]   And so I have to boot up an old copy of you door and find some old email.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.440]   And what I've done is to say, screw it.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.920]   I just lost your name.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.160]   You know, I just try to track it down on the net.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.360]   I kind of pray that I'll lose all my email.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.320]   I wish there were a switch, a big red switch on my desk that said, dump the email.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.160]   It's probably gone.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:18.960]   So remember when we were, we were talking about the HD DVD versus Blu-ray battle and
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.000]   I posited that, well, you know, these guys are going to screw it up by having this fight
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.080]   because consumers are just going to sit back.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.320]   They're not going to choose.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.560]   And by the time they solve this downloads will be there and you guys mocked me, but you
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.560]   know what?
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.280]   It might be coming true because Blu-ray is sinking fast.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:44.480]   The fact that HD DVD died didn't help one bit Blu-ray's market share fell to 8% in September.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.240]   92% of discs sold regular old DVD.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.840]   Well, I got an argument against this argument of yours.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.840]   All right.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:57.720]   Netflix CEO Barry McCarthy recently told Home Media Magazine he didn't expect Blu-ray
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.680]   to have much of an impact on the company's DVD business at all.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.640]   Prices are too high on the players.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.800]   Only a fraction of Netflix subscribers rent Blu-ray discs.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.080]   Here's the deal.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.560]   By the way, the prices on the Blu-ray drive is now you can get them at Costco for $279.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.040]   So it's not that inexpensive.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.040]   I'm not that cheap.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040]   The trouble is I do it.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   I do it for $40.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.240]   Well, you could buy a burner, which is what you really want in your house.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.080]   No, no, I just want a movie play.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.080]   I'm talking about it.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.080]   Okay.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   Well, let me say here's what the problem is.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.680]   Once they came out with those line doublers and then they came out with a 1080p line.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.680]   It looks good.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.680]   Whatever it is.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.680]   I know.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.480]   You put a regular DVD in there and it scales it up and then you put it on your.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.880]   It looks fine.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.480]   And that's what's killing HD.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.680]   I did the Blu-ray.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:49.200]   And this was my point, HD, movie and TV downloads are soaring and I think that this is really
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.200]   what's going to happen.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.000]   Now, still a small fraction of overall sales.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.400]   Yeah, and that's also a captain.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   That's a problem.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.080]   Yeah, the caps are going to be an issue.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.240]   Let's not get back in that conversation.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.880]   But I mean, iTunes now has HD, movie and a DVD or TV downloads in a high def.
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.160]   I just think this is where it's going.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.520]   I think Blu-ray just missed the boat.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.320]   It came in too late, too little, too expensive.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.360]   I mean, I have a PS3 and actually I'm one of those few Netflix folks who rents Blu-ray
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.240]   DVDs because they, John, you may say, oh, my DVD is going to look fine.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.400]   Blu-ray does look better.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.040]   Yeah, no, it does look better.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.400]   And I've looked at Blu-ray a lot.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.840]   You'll never convince anybody, but it does.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.560]   But I think Blu-ray is going to be saved if Sony and these other guys get their act
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.920]   together and give us some Blu-ray multiplayer burners for our computers.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920]   So we have a Blu-ray.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.920]   Why don't we have them on computers?
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.920]   What's going on?
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.920]   What is the story?
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.240]   What I think the big problem is, and this is why the thing is dying on the vine because
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.720]   we need, it's 30 gigabytes.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.040]   I mean, I could put all my photos, you know, well, almost a lot of my, actually my photos,
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.280]   by the way, I just loaded up a, I have 210 gigabytes of photos.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   Can you imagine?
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.280]   It's ridiculous.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.320]   Like kids will go to the hard drive and say, "Dad, would you please throw out photos
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.320]   once in a while?"
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.920]   I've got 50 different images of the same thing from different angles or different.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.760]   But Blu-ray, storage is cheap.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.800]   But I just wonder if, is it a copy protection issue?
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.400]   Why aren't we seeing, we're building the ultimate gaming machine.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.520]   As you say, John, a light on Blu-ray burner is not very expensive.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.520]   It's a couple hundred bucks.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.000]   Yeah, by the way, I don't like light on anything.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   Well, they're cheap.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   I don't care.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   It's the ultimate gaming machine.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.680]   I'm just going to put a cheap one in there.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.600]   But we put a burner in there and we put a reader in there.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.360]   What do you like for the Blu-ray burners?
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.760]   I don't like any of them because I've never seen one that I could play with.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760]   I mean, probably...
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   The other kind of stinks.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760]   The Plex-Stores got one.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   Plex-Stores did good stuff.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   Yeah, but you know, I've noticed this.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   I've been getting...
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.280]   The Plex-Stores lost their PR people and then they moved and I've been having trouble getting
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:51.360]   in touch with them.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.960]   And then the last Plex-Stores drive I had, which was a nice little drive, a very thin,
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.600]   little portable drive.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.800]   And when it comes up on my list of, you know, when I get the burning software, it says it's
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800]   a pioneer.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.880]   So I'm wondering what's going on.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880]   Interesting.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.320]   Maybe they're reselling the pioneer stuff.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:11.280]   Well, I don't know, the Plex-Stores used to always make the best of everything.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.280]   And now I want to...
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.720]   They reorganized and I think that maybe they're just a brand name now.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.360]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.760]   I'm looking on Wikipedia.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.240]   It says...
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.080]   The Plex-Store PX750 is a T-act drive.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.760]   The 800 is a Sony NEC drive.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.960]   The A20 Sony NEC and the 8300 is a LG.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:35.000]   Yeah, so maybe they're not...
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.800]   They're rebranding stuff.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.200]   That's what it's starting to look like, which is not good because they were making definitive
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.480]   products themselves.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.280]   This just underscores my argument that physical media is dying.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.800]   It's all going to the cloud.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.360]   It's all bits floating in space.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.840]   And it's all going to hard drives as well.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.840]   I mean, it's so...
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.360]   Why buy a hard burner?
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.440]   Well, you can just buy a hard...
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.000]   This would probably be less than the cost of the Blu-ray media, right?
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.920]   Yeah, those Seagate came with a whole slew of new drives, including a nice 1.5 terabyte
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.920]   drive.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.360]   And that was at Costco pricing drives.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.120]   And now you can get like a terabyte for like a couple of hundred bucks.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.120]   It's ridiculous.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:20.600]   I buy in bulk, I buy 750 gig Samsung drives about a hundred bucks each.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.480]   And that's what we record all our video on.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.440]   They're so cheap, I just...
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.440]   After a week, I take the drive, wrap it up and put it on the shelf and buy another...
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.680]   So you're archiving on these old hard drives?
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.680]   They're not old, they're new.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.080]   But yeah, I'm archiving on hard drives.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.280]   Which reminds me of the day, some 10, 15, 20 years ago, when you went on and on about
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.320]   how hard disks are unreliable because they lose their magnetism.
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.960]   They were 10 to 15 years ago.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.400]   And we got an expert on who said, "I don't know where you're getting that."
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.840]   Really, I don't remember that conversation.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:48.840]   Yeah, I do.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.840]   That's funny.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.800]   They're unreliable because they lose their magnet.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.040]   The magnet will stop working.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.040]   That's what's wrong.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.640]   They'll fall apart.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.040]   Well, hey, John, come on.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.440]   Maybe we did a radio show in 1992 and '93.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.240]   It says 15 years ago.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:12.520]   When the size of a hard drive, I think the top was 20 megabytes, maybe 40 megabytes.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.840]   Who would have thought we'd be talking about, for a hundred bucks, a terabyte of storage?
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.280]   And it was a scuzzing drive, too.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280]   It was...
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.840]   Oh, if you were lucky, it was a scuzzy.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.560]   If you spent some money, you got a really good one.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.040]   Yeah, if you could get this scuzzy, they'll work at all.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.400]   This was pre-scuzzy, Adam.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.000]   This was '92.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   These are these...
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   Pre-IDEs, I guess.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.400]   Well, there's actually something else.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.400]   ISA-ESAs.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400]   They were ISA.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400]   E-I-D-E.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.400]   Was it it?
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.400]   Yeah, that was a fancy one.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.400]   E-I-D-E.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.400]   And then we had...
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.400]   These are ISA drives.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.400]   And I think that we...
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:48.240]   These were the Seagate 20 megabyte MFM and 40 megabyte MFM drives.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.640]   Oh, that was fancy.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:56.080]   Well, I remember loading computer programs off a cassette tape.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.080]   Well, who doesn't?
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080]   Hey, remember this?
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:04.880]   The BBC used to broadcast those at night.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880]   What a show.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.880]   Yeah, well, the question is...
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.880]   For the Sinclair?
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.200]   Were they using the Kansas City standard?
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.280]   That's what I'd like to know.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.800]   A bunch of old farts.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.800]   Well, Harris was...
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.800]   Kansas City standard was the best.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.720]   Yeah, it was good.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.000]   You remember any of this, Will Harris?
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   No.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   What was your first hard drive?
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   What was the size of it?
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.800]   It was just born when the Kansas City standard.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:30.640]   My first hard drive was 850 megs.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.640]   Mine was five megs.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   Five megs is my first.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   I tell you what, it means...
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   $3,000.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.640]   The science...
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   I missed the...
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   D-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E-N-E
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:44.640]   It was the...
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   Yeah, right.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   Is that what I'm talking about?
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   Modem.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.640]   You didn't hear that anymore.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   It's the universal sign of the internet.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.080]   Anytime I can make this...
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.480]   That modem sound with my voice and get a connection.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.280]   You're the captain crunch of the modem crowd.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.440]   All right, I'm going to wrap this up.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.120]   We're starting to sound like a bunch of old beatings.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.120]   A bunch of dorks.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.120]   A bunch of dorks.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:14.560]   Will Harris, newly married, Mr. Will Harris, I guess we can call him now, is the head chief
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.040]   officer at channel flip.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:22.400]   Go there now, channel flip.com to watch my manly interview.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.080]   You made it look better than I thought at the time.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.000]   At the time I was dying.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   You actually...
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.480]   Yeah, well, I sliced out all the best bits.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   Yeah, you do.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:34.480]   So they're ready and juicy for people to watch.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.720]   Yeah, so it's down to about 30 seconds.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.040]   Thank you very much for doing it.

[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.120]   Thank you for asking.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.120]   It's also on my blog.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.840]   John C. Devorak's blog is Devorak.org/blog.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:51.800]   He also does about 18 podcasts for Meevio, including No Agenda, Tech 5.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.200]   He also does Cranky Geeks at CrankyGeeks.com.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.800]   Anything I left at, John?
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:56.800]   Market Watch.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.800]   Well, the market watch is in the PC Mag.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.800]   I never read that.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.800]   I never read that.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.800]   I never read that.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.800]   You...
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   I know what he does, at least the public does, but we don't.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.120]   You should, by the way, Adam and I did a really good No Agenda this last week.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.440]   It's at curry.com.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.480]   You can get a download a copy.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.080]   Because we dissected the debate.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.080]   Oh.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.560]   Because it's not a tech show.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.960]   So we dissected the debate, and I think it was pretty interesting.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.240]   There are no secrets, only information you don't yet have.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.920]   I think we did about a half an hour of dissection of the construction.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.920]   I don't have to listen.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.080]   You know, because as you...I am interested in all this politics and I...
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.520]   I would have killed you Leo.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.520]   Go listen.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   Oh, it wouldn't.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.520]   I just don't have time.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.400]   You actually would like this show because I think it's really...it's a very compelling
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.520]   show where we have 130,000 listeners now.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.520]   We're trying to get up.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.720]   We're nothing compared to your stuff, but you know, it gets to get into real...
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:51.880]   I'm jealous because I would love to do more, as you know, more political stuff.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:56.680]   And every time we do, John, we just get raked over the coals.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.680]   People hate it.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.240]   I think the reason...
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.080]   I mean, they don't like it when I do it on the blog either, but I think what Adam and
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:08.760]   I have done is that we've actually...we've actually niche marketed the product to a different
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.760]   group of people who are not...
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.560]   You said this is a political podcast.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.560]   I understand.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.560]   And we make...
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.400]   Well, it's not a meat politicist about whatever we feel like talking about, but there's no
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.400]   tech talk.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.200]   There was going to be any tech talk at all.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.320]   So if you want tech on this show, you're not going to get it.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.760]   People say to me, you know, "I don't mix politics with my tech.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.600]   I just want my tech, you know."
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.400]   Sometimes though, politics and tech impinge upon one another.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.600]   I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.720]   I mean, people don't...they don't have to.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.680]   I mean, I suppose if we're doing the Twitch show, I mean, I think people should be mostly
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.680]   about tech news.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.760]   I mean, that's what the show is set up for.
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:44.440]   And maybe you shouldn't be doing a lot of politics at it unless it's very tech related
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.880]   like this EFF lawsuit.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.040]   But for any other podcast you do or stuff on the side, I don't see any reason that everything
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.400]   you do has to be this way.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:59.160]   And I'm always annoyed when I write some long essay that happens to be very political.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.160]   And I've written political climates or I'd be not bed columnist.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.920]   So it's not like I can't do it.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.920]   And I get this flack.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.640]   And it's always like, "Hey, you don't have to read it."
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.360]   Right.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.600]   We have the right to express our opinion as any other citizen does.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:17.200]   And then they have the right to throw us in the chains and take us to Guantanamo Bay.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.600]   Well, that can happen.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:23.320]   Adam Curry is Mr. the king of podcasting at meveo.com.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.320]   Yes, sir.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.360]   Can I yield the balance of my plug to make an appeal?
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.600]   Yes, please, sir.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:33.320]   I'm pleased to appeal to the Citizens of the United States listening to Twit to contact
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.800]   their representative and tell them that they will hold them accountable for treason if
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.640]   they let this bill pass tomorrow.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.320]   The Emergency Economic Assistance Plan.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.320]   Really?
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320]   You think that's treasonous?
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.680]   It's treasonous, 100%.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.680]   I got to hear why now.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.680]   I'm sorry we're going political here folks.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.680]   No, no, no, no.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.680]   I want to get into it here.
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.680]   You don't.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:55.680]   Wow.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.880]   You're in bed with the right wing Republicans who believe that it's socialism.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.800]   I'm not in bed with Republicans or Democrats.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.280]   That's WWF, man.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.280]   That's just a joke.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.280]   I agree.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.560]   This is the shadow government, the real people who own our earth, they're doing this and
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.880]   shouldn't stand for it.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.880]   I like it.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   I like it.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.880]   I like it.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.880]   More of that kind of stuff on no agenda every week.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:14.880]   I like it.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:15.880]   I want to hear more about it.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.200]   Adam Curry, it's so nice to talk to you.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.960]   Curry.com, see you R-R-Y.com.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.120]   You get it all there.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:24.160]   And we thank you all for joining us.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   We dodged a bullet.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.240]   We almost got political there.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.880]   Another twi- another twit.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   This is amazing.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:40.280]   Is in the can.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:46.240]   In a moment, we're going to begin the show, but it may be that Mr. Norton will join us
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.080]   if his plumbing problems are solved.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.080]   Is that literal plumbing?
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.360]   Believe it or not, although he's used this excuse with me before, so I don't know.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.360]   But apparently...
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:00.480]   Is it like a problem with your plumbing over here?
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.480]   Right.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.480]   Same thing here.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:03.480]   It's just...
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.480]   Yeah, I'll write a key.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.960]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens forget
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960]   it.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:18.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.960]   Alright, doin' the twin, baby.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.960]   Doin' the twin.
