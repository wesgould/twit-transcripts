[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.840]   It's time for TWIT this week in Tech. The show we cover the week's Tech News. We've got
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.640]   a great panel for us. It's going to be fun this week. It's going to be a little wild.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.480]   What is it they said? What is it? Betty Davis said, "Fasten your seat belts. It's going
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.760]   to be a bumpy ride starting on my left with Aaron Griffith from Fortune." I'm sorry, Aaron
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   Griffin from, I already got the thing.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   Oh, Griffith.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   Griffith.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.640]   Griffith from Fortune.com. It would have been better. Aaron Griffin would have kind of
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.400]   tough one. Your parents maybe should have named you Arath.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.640]   Oh, wow. Okay. Never mind. Never mind. Also with us Dan Patterson. Hey, congratulations,
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.000]   Dan. When you first started working with us, you were at CBS Radio. Now you're at ABC.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.040]   We're at ABC. Now you're at CBS. Now CBS. Now CBS.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.320]   CBS Interactive via the great folks at Tech Republic, Jason Heiner and Crue. Nice to have
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.880]   you, but you're working out of the CNET offices in New York.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.080]   Yeah. Yeah. It's great to be with the CBS Interactive family and Jason's a fantastic
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.000]   boss. I know he's not strange or to your audience.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.920]   Love Jason. Yeah. I was really thrilled when he told me that he'd hired you. I thought that
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.800]   was fantastic. Me too. Yeah. Got you away from that other guy.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.120]   We'll talk about that other guy actually. He's in the news this week. Also here, speaking
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.440]   to other guys, Alex Wilhelm, TechCrunch.com. He's on the Ryan Koch train today.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.360]   Oh, yeah. It's actually a bullet rye from your own kitchen. So thank you for the
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.480]   supply. I love the bullet. Yes. It's fantastic. It's quite tasty, if you will.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.320]   Boy, there's a lot to talk about. Of course, before the show, I said there was nothing to talk
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.000]   about, but now that I'm looking, it looks like there are a few things we can talk about.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.280]   One or two, maybe. The battle is joined. ISIS versus anonymous.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.080]   That sounds like the old Reddit joke. Which would you rather fight a thousand?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.640]   Duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck? Or one horse-sized duck. Whatever it is. Yeah.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.760]   Which would you rather fight? This week, President Obama called ISIS a bunch of killers with great
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.600]   social media. You almost could say the same thing about anonymous. It's the battle of the social
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.200]   media guys. Here's the anonymous video announcing that some guy in a v4 vendetta mask announcing.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.400]   I just, I can't take it seriously when they wear that stupid headgear. Like, why can't they just
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.480]   talk to me? I just, I can't. No, it looks like a movie, doesn't it? It looks like it's straight
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.840]   out of Hollywood. Maybe they think it looks good when reality doesn't.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:43.040]   Is anonymous? First of all, anonymous can't declare anything. Anonymous is nothing. It's nobody.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.400]   It's a loosely knit group. You can't even say who's in it. It's very similar to the
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.200]   twit production crew. It's almost like Jason Howell declared war against ISIS.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   Well, that is not true. That is not true. Let it be known for the record. I did not do that.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.640]   But I don't, you know, do you think that an ISIS headquarters or Daesh headquarters are going
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:15.600]   who? I mean, literally who? Maybe, but they are, I mean, say what you will about anonymous and
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.960]   they do look kind of silly there, but they have had a pretty practical effect here.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.760]   Well, you covered the Occupy Wall Street movement, right?
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:32.160]   Yeah, I've been at Occupy and at the UN covering Diesha, as they say up there, or ISIL. In large part,
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.880]   because the word ISIS, of course, there's propaganda. There's power in the words of the states.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.560]   Right. ISIS is long. Right. And is long. I mean, there are many controversial parts of their name
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.760]   itself. So using Diesha, it's those who trample the book, you know, that's an effective way to
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.440]   communicate about what this organization is doing. And it's kind of, I see what anonymous is doing
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.720]   is kind of this weird new symmetrical attack. You know, when ISIS attacks a nation state,
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   it's asymmetric, right? Because they're small and they're using all these weird,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.880]   you know, small little ways to prick large nations. But anonymous is kind of doing the same thing
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.640]   right back to them. So it's, I certainly don't advocate for what anonymous does necessarily,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.040]   but it's very interesting to see similar tactics deployed against Daesh.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.240]   What does anonymous say it's going to do?
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.120]   They've been taking down Twitter accounts. Yeah. And taking down, they've also been, you know,
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.520]   they, a lot of members of Daesh, the websites are built using DDoS protection software like
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.480]   CloudFlare, which was in the news this week. And Telegram, of course. So they've been taking
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.920]   down those accounts or at least enumerating, listing these accounts. And then by the way,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.000]   Telegram has responded by pulling down 22, ISIS related channels. That doesn't mean
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.360]   ISIS can't continue to use Telegram. They still can, right? Of course.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.480]   Yeah. I think what anonymous is doing is just applying pressure in the opposite direction and
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.720]   saying, look, if you're CloudFlare, you know, the public has her right to know if you are
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.120]   keeping some of these questionable sites up. Same thing with Telegram. So at the very least,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.320]   they can expose and provide a little sunlight to where these creepy bastards are crawling.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.200]   Well, now, I don't actually, yeah, okay. Yeah, I don't, I mean, I thought I was a
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.520]   ban from swearing. Let's all get, oh, bastards is okay. Oh, let's all, especially when you're
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.440]   talking about Daesh. Okay. Let's all get on, you know, anybody who wants to get on the bandwagon
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.600]   fighting terrorism, that's fine. Some might say in some ways anonymous is a terrorist organization.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:39.520]   So, yeah, it's an interesting, it feels, I'll be honest with you. And I have, I don't know, but
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.320]   I have no inside knowledge of this. It feels like almost jumping on the bandwagon when
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.160]   ISIS says, yeah, I mean, anonymous says, yeah, we're going to take them on. It's like, oh,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.520]   this is good PR almost true, true, but I'll take it. I mean, like, if you're going to do
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.440]   anything to combat them, to bring them down, to hurt them, to defend organization and so
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.040]   far, you know, limit their influence, I'm in favor of that. So yeah, maybe it's a PR win for
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.600]   anonymous, quote, quote, whatever it is, but you know, still, I'll give it 10 points. Why not?
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.320]   One of the big tech stories, of course, about the terror attacks last weekend in Paris is,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.360]   of course, the immediate push by governments, US, British, French, to shut down encryption,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.000]   saying, well, how are we going to stop these guys if we can't hear what they're saying?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.240]   Of course, as Dan Fromkin has reported, reported the intercept and others, it looks like the
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.120]   terrorist suspects were actually not using encryption. In fact, one of the reasons they were able to
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:37.600]   find that Paris apartment hideout was it was, they found a phone that was thrown away that had,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.800]   you know, the GPS had nothing was encrypted. Yes. On the other hand, at the same time, this week,
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:50.240]   we heard that there is a help desk, an ISIS help desk, and they have an operational security manual,
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.200]   which involves things that I think we would all agree are, you know, good operational security
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:03.040]   protocols, like using tails, the Linux secure Linux portable distro, using
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.960]   three more, perhaps using, this is part of what part of the one of the reasons I haven't covered
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.320]   this story very much on Twitter all week, is I feel like there's disinformation also coming from
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.560]   governments about what they were using. We don't really know there's the implication they might
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.000]   have used WhatsApp, Telegram, or three more, but then that turns out that that came from the French
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.240]   government and there's not a whole lot of evidence they were using. Right. And there was that New
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.400]   York Times story that got taken down on the same topic. And I think if I recall properly,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.920]   the government spin people were out and forced right after the incident saying,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.160]   this abuse of encryption, this because of Snowden, that's the real. Well, that that one really was
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.440]   infuriated, blaming, blaming Snowden for this. Well, Dan, you cover this. So what do we know,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.240]   what don't we know? How much of this is just a government's attempt to blame something other
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:58.560]   than themselves? I mean, I know about the same amount as you guys know, and that's, you know,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.080]   anytime you hear certain types of coded language being used by government, particularly when it's
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:10.560]   used in the context of encryption and cybersecurity, you can look for things like we suspected or
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.880]   hearing the PlayStation rumor repeated over and over and over. You know, anything that is not
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.160]   substantiated, assume that the government is just using this as propaganda, not necessarily evil
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.720]   or malicious propaganda because they have their objective, their objective, as they see it,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.680]   a big challenge for all of us is to empathize and try to see things through, you know, other
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.680]   people's eyes and the way the government and many governments and law enforcement are looking at
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.800]   this is we just want to stop another, we fear another attack may happen, we want to stop it.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.200]   Thank you. I'm really, I think that's really important to say that, Dan. And I don't want to
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.520]   give the impression in any way that we are against the folks who are doing their best to protect us.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.440]   And I believe very much that they are absolutely sincere in those efforts.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.320]   On the other hand, as technologists, we understand that, you know, you can't stop
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.520]   encryption. It's too late. It's math. The horses left the barn.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.800]   And it's our job to communicate to them why this is important. You know, if you are upholding
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.200]   our government, then you also need to defend the very principles like privacy, in which our
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.560]   governments rest. And it's important for us to communicate.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.720]   How do we do that? I mean, I run a bunch of here and there, I run a security and the NSA and all
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.280]   this. And I have a really hard time taking these really kind of abstract concepts and making them
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.680]   applicable and understandable to the average person. So, you know, as a journalist, what's your
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.080]   approach or method that you do to kind of make this more, you know, understandable to the common
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.760]   person because we're nerds, dude, like, you know, but they're not. So, right, I think it's,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.400]   maybe it's just that like we are nerds, we're tech people and just say, I'm not talking to you
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.880]   as me being a journalist on high telling you how to communicate. It's like, I don't know,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.360]   people are people who are dudes, like, they just go, hey, everybody, let's take a breath and talk
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.680]   about what what we want. We want mutual, all of us. Yeah, it's unicorns. That's all to work.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:10.720]   All right, Aaron, we don't want you. That's all. Aaron, what's your take on this?
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.640]   The only thing I would add to that about getting people to kind of care and pay closer attention
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.760]   to this kind of stuff is it's really interesting how much people care now versus how much they
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.560]   cared when Anthem got hacked or when Target got hacked. You know, when all of their personal data
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.400]   was potentially exposed, people were outraged for a couple days or maybe weeks and then, oh,
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   whatever, what are you going to do? Not put your credit card information in there? And they kind
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.680]   of moved on. But now it's almost even further to the extreme where people are like, take my data,
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.720]   it's fine, just stop the terrorists. And I think that's our job as journalists to kind of educate
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.960]   people on exactly what we're giving up every time, you know, we either shrug or just sort of roll
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.400]   over and say, ah, privacy's not that important when it comes to terrorism. I guess that's the message.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.640]   You know, I've had a chance to talk on the radio to normal people and on Friday, I was on the
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.120]   morning show in Los Angeles, the Bill Handel morning show and spoke specifically about this and said,
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.160]   you know, the thing is important to understand, of course, we want to fight terrorism. And of
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.880]   course, it must be very frustrating for law enforcement to know that there are conversations
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.760]   going on that they can't eavesdrop on. But you know what, the terrorists can meet in private as
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.360]   well. And we wouldn't encourage law enforcement to start spying on everybody hoping to catch those
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:38.640]   private meetings that the math for encryption is already widely known. And you could tell
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.440]   Google, Apple and Microsoft, hey, make sure there's a backdoor and all your encryption stuff, okay?
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.960]   And they might even do it. But that wouldn't really accomplish anything, because there are
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.640]   plenty of other ways to encrypt. In fact, the only real problem with what with what would happen
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:01.760]   is that by putting a backdoor in, they'd hamper our ability to stay secure, that give a backdoor,
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:08.400]   not only the government, but to bad guys. And so this is kind of a wrong headed way to approach this.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.520]   But the rhetoric is so bad. I mean, we have Senator Dianne Feinstein,
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.720]   Arsene Derr out there talking about how tech companies are not doing their job to pull their
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.120]   way to really was a lot of blame on Apple and Google on this, which is ridiculous. Because you
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.480]   as you said, you can't beat math, you can't break math and you've built in a front door or a
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.360]   backdoor. Well, all right, let me play. Let me play devil's advocate. If you if you somehow
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:36.240]   without trumpeting it, if you manage to get a backdoor in Windows and OS 10 and Gmail, let's say,
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.720]   and you don't tell anybody, no one knows, isn't it likely that bad guys will use those operating
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.560]   systems? And if they don't know that they might be, we might be able to catch them?
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.520]   Yeah, that's you.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   I mean, honestly, that's the only reason that's the only way this works. If you read this
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:01.280]   opposite manual, and I don't know where this came from, this is again, this problem of, is that,
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.360]   is that what's the provenance of this? Is this something that some French government officials
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:14.800]   offered up? Or is this actually an opposite manual for ISIS? But it's smart enough to say use
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.520]   tails, which, you know, there's no way there's a government backdoor in tails.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:27.520]   You know, so you they were using black phone. They were this is the wired story.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.880]   Does wired say where they got this manual from? I don't I don't know if they do.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   Not some acknowledge. No. So but they're saying use black phone. They're used there. If that if
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.400]   that manual is true, it's well informed. It is it is they're not saying hey, you don't have to worry,
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.240]   you could trust Microsoft spitlocker. There's no way the government has a backdoor in there.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.000]   They're not that dumb in other words. I'm just surprised that people are surprised. This is
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.840]   actually a thing. I mean, ISIS has revenue. They have an army. You know, why wouldn't they have an
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.760]   IT desk? You know, why wouldn't they have some some knowledge for their operatives? I mean,
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.200]   the people are like, Oh my gosh, they have this IT thing. Well, yeah, what do you think they had
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.080]   nothing? Right. That's this is the 20. Well, that's because when I first when ISIS first, you know,
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.600]   sort of came out of our government dismissed it as like, Oh, we don't have to worry about these
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.400]   guys. This is just a ragtag crew. And you know, that's kind of what people believed for a long
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.200]   time. So I think it is shocking when these kinds of things come out interesting that they do in
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   this opposite manual recommend apples messages as a secure way to send the imbalance.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.680]   For you, Tim Cook, it's all for you. I'm not sure I would.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:37.040]   I think it has been really quiet ever since last week, haven't they? We haven't even come out and
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.120]   said anything and responded to the criticisms, right? And they're basically taking that brunt of
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:47.040]   this. I cook has has been pretty outspoken about saying governments must not put a backdoor
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.760]   in encryption, but not this week specifically. No, I don't think so. But he may just be
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.440]   spoken. We live in a complicated age. And it may just be that there are no there are no simple
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.320]   solutions. This is an organization that's built its brand and digital literacy. And unfortunately,
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.040]   they know a lot of the same thing we know. And it's just challenging.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.200]   This was inevitable, wasn't it? I mean, absolutely. You know, I know from having talked to law
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.960]   enforcement, the Secret Service and so forth, this is by the way, a recent
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.880]   Tim Cook interview or a talk at a recent event. The
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:29.920]   there's a couple of days ago. Yeah, the ITI. Yeah. And he did, in fact, say encryption
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.720]   is a security tool. We rely on everyday to stop criminals from dreaming our bank accounts to
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.120]   shield our cars and airplanes from being taken over by malicious hacks to otherwise preserve
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.680]   our security and safety. We deeply appreciate law enforcement and the national security
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:49.920]   communities to work to protect us. But and this is I think this is well said, weakening encryption
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.480]   or creating back doors to encrypted devices and data for use by the good guys would actually
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.360]   create vulnerabilities to be exploited by the bad guys, which would almost certainly cause
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.160]   serious physical and financial harm across a society and economy. Weakening security with
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.600]   the aim of advancing security does not make sense. That's well said. I think that if to answer
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.040]   your question, I'll like, that's what that's what we should be telling people. I mean, that's
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.320]   put and also very important. I mean, if you weaken encryption to the point which it is,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.440]   is hackable and ununincryptable, then you don't have encryption at all. So, but it was can't
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.760]   have it both ways here. Wasn't it inevitable though? I started saying when I've spoken in the past to
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:38.240]   say the Secret Service, they kind of always counted on the stupidity of bad guys that they
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.640]   wouldn't use good, upset. They once said, we don't worry too much about hold this encryption because
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.120]   nine times in a 10, you asked the bad guy for the password and they give it to you. So,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.760]   it's a different environment. They're starting to work in now. It was inevitable where the bad
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.560]   guys are more sophisticated. They have more resources. And they're in fact are using technologies
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:06.160]   to protect themselves just as we use those technologies. And I can understand the frustration
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.760]   of law enforcement, but goodness, this has been going on for decades.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.880]   The big beef is that it was easy and now it's harder and that's their main complaint.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.560]   Then I guess work more. We do them billions of dollars a year to do this. So, I don't have a lot
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.200]   of pity if their dog is a little tougher. According to the, according to Wired, the
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.880]   opposite guy mentions the tour browser, the tales operating system, Crypto Cat, which is a
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:33.840]   well designed, secure, publicly crypto messaging system, Wicker, I'm not familiar with Telegram,
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.600]   Hushmail and Protonmail for email, Redphone and Signal for encrypted phone communications.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.400]   Gmail, the guide notes, is only considered secure if the account is open to using false
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.640]   credentials and is used with a tour or a VPN. Android and iOS are only secure when communications
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.320]   are routed through a tour. They advise disabling the GPS tagging feature on mobile phones to avoid
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.480]   leaking location data when taking photos. Unless you're John McAfee, then please keep doing it.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.000]   Well, that's the irony. Again, this is what the police are telling us, but in France,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.600]   they found that phone with unencrypted GPS data and that was what led them to the apartment
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.040]   where several of the terrorists or alleged terrorists were planning. Do we have to call them alleged
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.320]   if they're terrorists? I think we still have to say that. But mostly terrorists, if we will.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.600]   I lose terrorists adjacent. I think they're kind of self identified as terrorists.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.360]   Okay, I don't think they're late. They admit it. Yeah. It's actually this
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.840]   opposite manual is fairly good. The only thing I would disagree with is maybe saying I message
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.880]   because they're assuming it's impervious to apparently even terrorists believe Apple's marketing
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.480]   message, which is impressive. You have to give them that. They're already in their own reality
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   distortion field because of their even terrorists who subject to their reality
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.280]   discussions. What happens to the actual curvature of space in that area?
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:03.680]   Wow. I don't know. That's terrifying. So again, I don't know what the provenance is of this
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:09.600]   opposite manual, but it's... It doesn't. Who wrote it? Yeah. Okay. Someone with a lot of time on the
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.840]   App Store looks like. All right. Well, is there anything else to say about the story? I mean,
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.840]   we're seeing a lot of coverage, of course, in mainstream media. I just thought,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.600]   you know, as technologists, I think it's important that we weigh in with both support for law enforcement.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.640]   Yeah. I want to be protected, but at the same time, some common sense about math.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.720]   Yes. All right. Although it's helped us understand Congress a little bit better,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.160]   I feel, because whenever I watch people... They don't seem to understand that. Exactly. So it's
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.400]   kind of been a calling of the herd in a way because people will say, "Don't things about encryption
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:47.600]   that sound moderate and fair when they're just not possible." And that's your point. And so I've
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.120]   managed to cross-pool off my list of morons. And I've been doing that. You're not going to have
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.200]   many members of Congress left after you start crossing the people. It's down to two. I'm not from
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:01.440]   Montana. I haven't said a word in four years. By the way, an update on the story we talked about
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:09.040]   last week, we mentioned that Carnegie Mellon had been kind of co-opted by the NSA or the FBI,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:18.560]   I should say, which allegedly paid them a million dollars to crack Tor so that the FBI could find
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:25.600]   some suspects. Carnegie Mellon said, "We didn't make a million dollars. We were forced to do this.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   We were served with a subpoena to hand over research unrelated to unmasking the enemies
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:38.240]   of users on the Tor network." So I just want to make sure that we mentioned that,
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.480]   correct the record. Isn't it pounds Carnegie?
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:48.880]   I don't know. I don't think so. I know it's Pulitzer. Not Pulitzer. Really? Yeah, but
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.440]   Carnegie? I thought it was Carnegie. That wasn't East Coast. It's Scottish. It's Scottish.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.760]   I don't know. It's Silicon Valley. Not Silicon Valley. I will cry. Please don't say Silicon Valley,
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.440]   OSX or DOS. This is pain. In any of those three cases, I shall write you.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:12.960]   Wait, what's OSX? OSX? People say OSX? You don't say OSX. OSX. OSX. OSX. OSX. Okay,
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.360]   I don't talk about operating systems. You're a wise woman. My version enough.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   Connie Chung very famously, probably 20 years ago now, was interviewing Bill Gates
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.600]   and said, "This MS dose operating system, tell me about that."
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.720]   That is inappropriate on every fossil level. That was kind of the end of the line on that one.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:41.120]   Chelsea Handler did a tour in Silicon Valley and called it Silicon Valley the whole time.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.760]   She was corrected by somebody and she decided to just go with it. I think I would stay with it.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.800]   Kind of hilarious. It's funny. The commenter says, "Unix dose trace." Oh, man, that's terrible.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.440]   As far as joke scale, you're fired. Whoever you are, felt.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.920]   All right, moving on. Actually, we'll talk about the 30th anniversary of Windows.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.720]   I'm going to prepare your Windows anecdotes. You guys are all too young to even remember.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.280]   You were not even born when Windows came out. I was negative four.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.600]   She's Louise. Sorry. Our show today is Movember.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:21.520]   Movember is the month of November when we all grow, when we all grow, none of you did it.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:28.640]   We all grow beards and mustaches to raise awareness. Men's health, if you are or are not
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.480]   shaving this month, I want to let you know about Harry's because at some point you're going to want
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:39.840]   to shave off that luscious growth that you've created. By the way, Harry supports Movember.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:46.560]   You would think really a razor company supporting Movember? No, they do. They do. In fact,
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:54.240]   they donate to Movember. $5 off your first purchase when you mention Twit 5 and $5
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.760]   when you buy the Movember kit. But the real key to Harry's, my friends, is the fabulous Harry's
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:07.840]   razor. That's what made Harry's name way back in like three years ago when they bought the factory.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.320]   There we go. Here's the razor blades. When they bought the factory, one of the nice things about
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.160]   Harry's blades is if you own the factory and they own this factory in Germany,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.800]   you can design your blades for performance, for sharpness and sell them direct to your customers
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:28.400]   without having that middleman markup. So you know when you go and you go get that Gillette razor
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.640]   at the drugstore and it's $4 a blade, you won't be paying. That's about half that from Harry's.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   Over a million guys now, and I take a little credit for this, have made the switch to Harry's.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   Website's great. Tastes less than 30 seconds to place an order. I use Harry's every day. I love it.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.360]   It's the best shave I've ever had. You get the kit for very affordable price effects. If you get
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.560]   the Truman $15 and then you're going to save $5 with their offer, that means $10 to get started.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.680]   And then of course, you're going to get your regular shipments of Harry's blades, Harry's
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:05.440]   cream and all the Harry's accoutrement. There you go. That's the Truman Harry's.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:11.040]   H-A-R-R-Y-S.com enter the offer code TWIT5 at checkout to save $5. And we thank Harry's.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:18.080]   I will find out how much they raised for Movember through their Movember kits.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.000]   Also as a PSA if you're a dude and you didn't Movember just to not shave for a month?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.360]   Yeah. Points. Really? When in Dobby Lacy, just let it all just...
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.920]   Well, but when it comes time to shave those...
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.240]   Wait. ...of some Movember whiskers off. Make sure you go with Harry's.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.160]   I just hope they add by accident. That's... All right. No, you know what the truth is,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.120]   even if you're growing a mustache or beard, you still got a... You got a... That's true.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.840]   Clean up. Lucky I see that. I got a nice clean beard there with you.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.280]   You are a beautiful, beautiful man.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.800]   Is that what you wanted to say? I was confused. I've been trying to convince them to do a women's
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:59.840]   line that I would call Harry's, but they so far have turned their back on my brilliant idea.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.520]   Get on that, Harry's. Get on now. When Harry's be good.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.680]   Harry, you're good. They actually have apps. Thank you.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.520]   You know, chatroom desolves reminded me they have an app now for iOS so you can order right
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.480]   through the smartphone. Everybody's got to have an app, right? I just don't have an app.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.920]   Did you see? I don't actually think you do. I don't think everyone needs an app.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.760]   I think people got a little too excited about needing an app and then they realized that
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.680]   eight people were going to download it and that the average person downloads zero apps
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.000]   per month and that it's a huge waste of resources. No offense against Harry's.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.320]   You realize that you're speaking to somebody who's currently spending
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.560]   tens of thousands of dollars to develop iOS and Android apps for Twitch, right? Oops.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:48.720]   That's your personal Rick Perry moment. Remember iOS, iOS, Android, and realize. Oops. Oops. I can't.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:54.160]   I mean, there's just a lot of like kind of people. No, no, I complete with agree with you.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.680]   I complete with you. You have to make following. You're going to get people to download your app.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:04.080]   A lot of other people don't have the daily or weekly use case. Actually, we have a good use case.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.040]   In any, I think any video or audio podcast or whatever use case, you can use a podcast app
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:15.040]   to subscribe. But it used to be the website and then we spent a lot of money on websites
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.800]   was the place that you would find out about us and what we're doing. But I realized,
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.440]   you know, not so long ago, it took me a while for the light bulb went on. The people don't need
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.240]   the website anymore. What they need is an app and an easy app that will allow you to watch live,
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.160]   listen live, subscribe to the shows you want. Anyway, you're right. Too many apps.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:37.520]   I'll try to get mail available all fine. Twit.tv stores around your local area. Drop in.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   Well, the irony is we didn't even need to do apps because we have very nice fans. We have many.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.280]   There are many apps. They should know there's three different Twitter apps on the new Apple TV.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:51.600]   Three. Four now Curtis. Wow. That's where you need to have apps in the Apple TV, not in the app store.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.800]   I think there's like such a part of the problem is that there's been no curation on Google or
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:04.000]   Apple's part whatsoever or no sort of way to really optimize for app developers. But on Apple TV,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.240]   it's 100% curated. And so if you're in there, you've made it and you're going to have a built-in
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.920]   following. Well, what about this thing Google announced this week? App streaming, Google search
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:23.840]   results are now going to include app content. Wild, right? And I think a very good thing,
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:29.040]   you know, in response to what you're talking about, Aaron, because if you have an app, I think the
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   example they gave was at hotels tonight. So if you searched for hotels right now in Chicago,
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.800]   you would of course on a Google search get their normal results, but they are also going to give
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.200]   you pages from the hotels tonight app, which is great. Talk about discovery for hotels tonight.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:54.400]   That's fabulous. I mean, that's like huge playing huge defense. Google is because they've realized
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.520]   that all those very, very valuable clicks that they would have gotten from normal Google search
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.160]   on mobile are just going straight to hotel tonight. And so Google's not getting that click money
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.760]   from the mobile web. And so they've been they've been scrambling to try to figure this out for a
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   really long time. And this is a really cool and smart way for them to kind of get in the middle
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.160]   of that transaction that they were previously getting cut out of. Now the apps go ahead, Dan,
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.480]   non like a non linear bridge between you remember in the early days of the app store,
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:29.120]   we we kind of fretted a little bit and said, well, we're building all of these islands that stand
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.600]   apart from each other. What they've built here is this kind of non linear bridge that connects all
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:41.120]   of those little islands. I think it's very intriguing. Now Google has to work with the publisher.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.360]   The publisher has to agree. And apparently what's happening is Google's running the app on its
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:53.120]   server somehow to extract the information from the app. So it's a really interesting.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.160]   Yeah, something weird.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.640]   How does that work? So it was running hotel tonight on their server? I mean,
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.160]   yeah, because it's up to date information, right? It's current information.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.160]   Yeah, that's. But you have to really trust Google to not steal all your stuff. I mean,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.600]   you're going to run your instance on their servers as well as your own. I mean, that's going to be
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.080]   that's an intense amount of like hand holding, I feel. Well, it's. Also, Google, what's Google
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.600]   going to do with all of that data? That's like, it's bad enough that Google owns so much data on me
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.760]   as it is, but now combining that with all the other little independent apps that I use,
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.240]   says little, little daunting. Aaron, what have you been up to? I'm very curious now.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.320]   But wait a minute. But wait a minute. First of all, it's a very limited trial. And you have to have
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:41.360]   Android. It's only a limited number of apps. You have to be on Wi-Fi. It won't work on LTE.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.200]   Hotel and night, Chamonny, Daily Horoscope. There are a couple of horoscope apps.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:52.000]   And why? The New York. People like their horoscopes. Well, if you're searching for it. Okay, so I'm
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.480]   searching my birthday is in a week. I'm going to know Sagittarius and I'm searching for it.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:01.520]   If you're Google, you want to give people the best information, right? So what you want to do is
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.000]   not just kind of, you know, what do I get if I search for Sagittarius? What does that even mean?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.640]   Means, happy birthday. Happy birthday, by the way. I understand that's the right answer.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:15.520]   Legitimately, what's the supposed? So, well, look here. If I search for Sagittarius, I don't know.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.320]   It's whenever the November 22nd through December 21st. What does it mean though? Nothing. It's not
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.560]   what I'm talking about. It's astrology. You've heard of that, right? I have, but I don't. I'm just
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.400]   saying they have two astrology apps. If you search it. How many people do Alex? It's possible to get
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   it. I'm right. They're wrong. So, huh. Admittedly, I doubt very much the position of the moon and
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.840]   stars had anything to do with my personality. You couldn't fix that.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:45.440]   But look what happens if I search for Sagittarius. I get Sagittarius.com, free horoscopes. I get,
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:51.760]   you know, a bunch of sites. I get Wikipedia. Whereas it would be, I think, a better search from my
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:57.040]   point of view as a user if I got some actual horoscopes popping up from an astrology app, right?
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.320]   So that's the idea or let's, hotels tonight is probably more useful. If I'm looking for a hotel,
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.320]   I would want to have actual hotels and I could book and you click a link, it pulls you back into
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:12.640]   the app, I guess. Aaron, what's your, what's your star sign? I'm a Pisces. You're a,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.240]   sunset. You're a Pisces on a cancer. You're such a terrorist dam. Way in.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.080]   Aquarius. Yeah. That's something I don't like you. All right. Fair enough.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.720]   The tone of this, the tone of this voice and saying that was like, are you going to use this
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:31.040]   and can sneak you? Anyways, I mean, I mean, I think it's cool they're delving into apps in this way.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.240]   I'm not surprised by it because it's a, you know, the true of a data for Google to index,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.960]   but I will be curious about how many apps are actually willing to concede. Why wouldn't you?
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.920]   Well, yeah, because you want to tell you as it. Because you want Google, because you want Google,
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.400]   or you want Google out of it. You want, if you're kayak, for example, you know, people go straight
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.480]   to kayak to book that thing. Why do they need Google getting in the middle there?
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.920]   Yeah. Because discovery, discovery,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.480]   discovery, perhaps, perhaps, I'll tell you, I'll give you a perfect example. I would love it if
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:07.120]   Google would take the next step and index podcasts so that if you searched for Google streaming search
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.160]   or streaming app search, one of the things that might show up is twit with a link right to that
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.800]   part of the podcast. That's to my benefit. That doesn't take anything away from me. That helps
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.680]   my discovery. That helps hotel tonight's discovery, doesn't it? But you're also not buying search ads.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:27.200]   So Google doesn't have a huge incentive to work with you.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.560]   Right. Aaron, do you think this is a play to get more app discovery dollars in the
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.880]   Dorifa Google? Because it's been a big Facebook revenue stream. But apps selling...
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:43.120]   I think it's different than that. I think it's because it doesn't seem like this is related to
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.600]   their ads business. But it is kind of an extension of something that they announced earlier this year.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:54.240]   They have this kind of campaign called Micro Moments, where they're basically trying to get in
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.800]   every time anyone searches for anything. They want to sort of be there with really rich
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.200]   information. And one of the categories that they really highlighted was hotels. And it's like on
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.240]   mobile search, basically. And I think it's on Android and iOS. The results are really, really rich.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:17.120]   It has the pricing. It's geo-located. So it's a really rich ad that mimics the app.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.720]   The app experience. And so I think that's just an extension of this. They want people to come to
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:28.880]   mobile search first instead of going straight to the app. So that paragraph is why I read
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.320]   her eight minutes. Stop. You guys are so deeply cynical about Google. It hurts me.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:40.240]   Wait, because we acknowledge Google's a business? No, but they are a business. But what is Google's
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.040]   goal? Google's goal is to give users the information they want. If you're searching
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.960]   for this information, that doesn't mean you want to fire up an app. Which app do you fire up?
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:57.920]   What you would love is to type in the search or use, "Okay, Google will give you that result too,"
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.680]   and say, "I need a hotel in Chicago." And then Google doesn't just limit itself to websites.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.880]   But wherever that information is, pulls it up. That's what users want. This doesn't have to be
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:15.360]   some deeply cynical ad ploy. It's trying to give users what they want in search, right? What do you
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.400]   guys-- Google always is striving to do both, obviously. That's how they make a living. I'm not
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.000]   saying they're not making a living. They ought to make a living. They wouldn't do it if it was a
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.760]   bad experience. And I agree with you. It is a good experience and it's smart on their part. But
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.520]   this has been something they've been working on for a while. I feel bad because anything Google
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:37.200]   does, people look through the lens. And I guess it's your job because you're cynical people.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.960]   And then look through the lens.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.760]   Turn turtle-less.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.840]   Yeah, that's your job. That looks through the lens of-- and I try to, too. But
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:50.160]   give them a little bit of credit. Maybe they're just trying to give you a better search experience.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.760]   And to me, this sounds like a better search experience. I'm sorry, it's Dan's turn. Go ahead, Dan.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.480]   Well, it could force a really interesting-- I'm curious what you guys think about this. It could
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.200]   force a really interesting competitive response from Apple and Amazon. And I think that that really
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.680]   could make a better-- I mean, being cynical is the correct way to think about it.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.040]   I agree. I agree.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:15.680]   But it could force a really interesting competitive response, which is what we say we like from
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.880]   Apple and Amazon and other ecosystem builders. And I would love to see something similar from Apple.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.480]   I think that those iOS apps tend to be a little more robust than Android apps, or at least for
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.720]   my preference. And I'd love to see something competitive.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.960]   Why do people give Apple a free pass? And then they say Google is to steal all your stuff and
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.320]   their horrible people.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.920]   Well, my girlfriend works for Google, so I've been told to say that Google is a great corporation
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.400]   to work for and a really important part of the national economy. It's interesting to say that
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.200]   because the chairman had already decided you couldn't possibly have a girlfriend.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.080]   Oh, well, they were most-- Right, actually. It's a recently.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.920]   No, I mean, I think that we give-- Oh, so she doesn't know you that well.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.760]   She's in Virginia right now. I'm going to be in trouble when she's back.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.120]   No, I think that we give Google less for a free pass because they are more in our lives. I mean,
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.280]   Apple is notoriously good at hardware and bad software. But we all use Gmail,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   we all use Google services. And so we have a much higher data footprint, I feel,
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.560]   inside of the Google ecosystem compared to Apple. And so that's why I care a little more.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:16.480]   No, it's about what they want from us. Apple is only trying to sell us products.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.840]   And so they don't need our personal data at all. Google and Facebook are trying to put ads in
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.280]   front of us. And the more targeted they are with the more data they have, the more they can charge
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.720]   for those ads. So their business model is all about
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:33.200]   gathering data. I'm taking away your title as cynic. If you actually believe that Apple doesn't
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:39.760]   care about your personal data, then you are a Pollyanna. You're not a cynic. Apple absolutely
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.360]   wants your personal data. They keep it to themselves. That's the only difference.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.520]   Their business model is not aligned or is not dependent on them. Talk to the guy who runs
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.720]   iAds, what his business model is. Is that still a thing? I don't think I think I think
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.600]   I think I think I think much of a success. And that's why Apple's sort of using this moment to
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.800]   be a privacy advocate because their ads business isn't really...
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.960]   But I think that that just works their model. In 10 years, Apple, Apple aspiration only wants to
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.640]   be as much of a data company as Google can be. They're just very smart about directing their
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.200]   competencies. And their competencies are hardware. I totally believe what you're saying. And I've
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.960]   made the same argument. I just also don't believe that Apple, no company is altruistic
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:26.880]   in all companies. I'm in it for the profit. You're in it for the profit. We're not doing what we do
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:37.280]   but we love it. But one has to make a living. And I think Google truly does want to organize
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.880]   the world's data and make it more available to people. They see that as a very positive goal.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.520]   And yes, they'd like to make money while they're doing it. Apple originally was all about making
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:53.920]   computing easy and accessible to the masses. I'm not sure that they actually have kept true to that
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:00.480]   goal. I feel like Apple says, "Ooh, this iPhone thing really sells well. Let's go all in on this."
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.560]   This is why I work for Verizon. I want to support overpriced, bad, cell phone service everywhere.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:12.880]   But I think Apple... Absolutely, Apple is smart to say we're the privacy company. And I think that
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.920]   they have to walk the walk if people are going to believe that. But it doesn't mean Apple doesn't
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.440]   want to know this information. They just say, "Well, we're going to keep it to ourselves."
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:29.840]   That's terrifying, but okay. Everything's correct. I just don't like it. I wish I was not the case.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.560]   But yeah, it's accurate. And actually, it's a disadvantage in some regards because it's hard
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:40.000]   to compete with things like Google now, which really rely on Google exposing everything it knows
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.920]   about you. Google has to... In the probably unenviable position of how to let people know what it knows
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.560]   in order to give them the services it wants. Apple can pretend it knows nothing.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.200]   Well, Donald Rumsfeld said, "There are no knowns. There are unknowns. There's known unknowns.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   Unknowns. So there you go." Did you memorize that? No, I just have him. Rumsfeld smart.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.120]   You memorize that. Like a year ago. Did you sit in front of a mirror and actually...
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.560]   No, before a twin, I go home by practice, my jokes. Because that is not...
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.320]   Rumsfeld quotes. That is not... Donald Rumsfeld quotes. It's not the kind of thing that just
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.920]   trippingly comes to the lips. Dude, we're all dorks. I mean, this is part of our general
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.000]   lexicon. It wasn't a great quote. Thank you. Well, Rumsfeld really. Let's take a break. I do
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.360]   want to celebrate 30 years of Windows. We're going to do that in a bit. But first,
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.800]   let's take a look at what you missed. If you missed anything this week on Twit.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:33.520]   Previously on Twit. I seem to have lost my dog in Fallout. No. I traded him for the robot with
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.640]   the flame coming out of his butt. But now I can't find him anymore. In any other context,
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:44.560]   this would be nonsense words. Twit Live specials. Pedestrian signal lights.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.600]   They're everybody's on those little hovercraft things, riding down the street now.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:55.360]   Don't you hate it though when the guy leaves his left turn ear on all day. I hate that.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.520]   10 News Tonight.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.720]   There is really no area of our lives, public or personal, that Facebook does not want to get up
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:09.680]   all into soon when you change your relationship status on Facebook. You will have options
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.920]   beyond just blocking your ex. According to Facebook, you'll be presented with screens that will
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:19.760]   allow you to see less from your ex. Limit what your ex can see of you and edit your photos.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.560]   Just like we used to do with the tools we had back in the 90s. Back then we called them scissors.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:30.080]   Twit. We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. Somebody's saying,
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.640]   "When did, uh, when did Windows Weekly add a laugh track?"
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:41.360]   I like it. We need to do that more often. I like having a live studio answer. You have a
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.080]   nice studio audience today. Thank you for being here. If you want to be on the be in the show,
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.280]   be part of the show, just email tickets at Twit.tv. We've been, there's a guy dressed up as a chef
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:56.560]   out there. Actually, his hat's quite nice. Should I put it on? You want to wear his hat?
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:04.240]   Ask Roberto if it later is. Birdo, come on your hat. 30 years of Windows. It was on November 20th,
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:14.000]   1985 that Windows 1, this is like a coronation. He's handing me. I now pronounce you king of all
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.520]   cooks. That is better. Well, I'm known for my amazing fashion sense. So Leo's story is crap
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.280]   and I'm here wearing a hat. So hey, how's it going? I think anybody who tunes in right now
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:28.320]   is puzzled. Puzzle indeed. So before the show started, and you guys were not here for this,
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:34.160]   there was a very well dressed gentleman singing songs in Leo's chair. And he was wearing this
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.760]   hat. Now I'm wearing this hat, but I can't sing. So, you know, he was singing Italian songs.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.880]   What did you do? Italian songs. Who here is old enough to remember Windows 1.0 besides me?
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:53.360]   Where's Michael? None of you guys. That's depressing. If you remember it, you are officially old.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:44:00.240]   That's what the register says November 20th, 1985. And you got to see the picture of Bill Gates
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:08.960]   showing this off somewhere. He looks like he's 12. Windows 1.0, it's kind of when you look at it,
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:15.440]   it's kind of interesting because it was tiled windows. They weren't overlapping. It wasn't really
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.880]   windows as we know it. It was a DOS shell. DOS was still sitting behind there. You had to have
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:30.320]   at least PC DOS 2.0. You needed two double-sided floppy disk drives to run it. 256k.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:37.600]   Wow. Not megs, not gigs, K of memory. And apparently required something that a very few people
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:47.040]   have had to have in those days, a graphics card. You could run some DOS programs in windowed mode,
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:55.440]   but most of them would just take over the screen. About half a million copies sold in the first
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:02.560]   two years. It went gold. In other words, semi gold. Half a gold. I like this because when you look
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.840]   back at the very first versions of windows and you look at the current version of windows,
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.880]   it's still kind of similar. It's squares, it's menus, it's written words. It's dramatically
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.480]   different, but also very much still the same. And I like to appreciate our kind of computing
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.000]   history. And now we've got Aaron, what was the first version of Windows you used?
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.120]   Probably 95. Yeah. That was the first really good version. I think one was good.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:31.520]   Yeah. I remember looking at 3-1 and thinking, "Wow, in fact, Microsoft's really kind of,
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:38.800]   you know, kind of done something here." And I remember talking to Steve Jobs in '94.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.440]   And I'm dropping. And he said, well, he was, this was when he was out at Apple, right?
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:49.520]   I know. But he couldn't stop talking about Apple. He said, "I gave them a 10-year lead, right? When
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.520]   we came out with a Mac, that's in '84, one year before Windows 1, they had, we had a 10-year lead
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.160]   and they pissed it away. And I... Is that his voice sound scene? That's how he thinks you
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.880]   dropped sounds? I had to make it some movies. And they pissed it away. No, he was pissed because
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:11.200]   he said, "We had a lead." This, you're looking at Windows 3-1-1 running on the airport system in
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:21.280]   Orley, France, where it crashed. And that's how people know that the menu system in Orley,
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:27.920]   France, was running Windows 3-1. Mine, sweeper, solitaire. Those are some games. Remember those?
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.880]   I still play them, so I can't really say I remember them. But...
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.640]   No, millions of... And endured.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.440]   They have endured. I mean, what else do you do with the office? You know, come on.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:42.800]   Apparently, Windows 3-1 is still embedded in many, like ATMs. It's an embedded version of
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.520]   Windows 3-1. It's still quite around, not just at the Orley airport.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:55.920]   Ah, let's see. Other memories of Windows. I mean, Windows 7 was amazing and then 8 happened.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:00.560]   That's the most important reason to think I feel. 7 was very good. 7 was solid. So XP was... Okay,
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:08.240]   NT was good. Windows 2000 was awesome. Windows XP was trying to merge the consumer version of
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:16.000]   Windows, the Windows 95-98ME line, into the Windows NT 2000 line. And so for that reason alone,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.080]   I think it was good. It was much more robust. Remember 98 and 95-
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.720]   98 was a lot. Blue screen and death, all that.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:29.520]   But XP was pretty good. By the time Service Pack 2 came out, XP was secure,
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:36.560]   because they turned on the firewall on XP. 7, I think, was very, very good. Vista, not so high.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.560]   Oh, we almost forgot Vista entirely.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.080]   Oh, there's that thing in between.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:45.440]   Vista-like Windows-ME. You know what? Windows-ME, Vista, and Windows 8. They're all the same kind of
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.040]   something went horribly wrong in my Mac.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.480]   Mac. Bob. Zoom. Bob.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.320]   You know, the usual things. But I mean, I mean, I'm really kind of curious. Windows 10's been out
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:58.080]   now for a little bit. Dan, what do you think of a Windows 10?
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:05.840]   I like it quite a bit. I upgraded the day it came out. It was full of bugs and weirdness.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.240]   But within a couple of weeks, it seemed to work itself out.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.440]   It's got more song. It's got more song.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.440]   It's got more song. Yeah. Yeah. It's a return to form. I mean, it's something... I think
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.120]   beyond the features, it's something that feels comfortable and familiar to consumers.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.560]   And I think that that's maybe something that is undersold in the history of Windows. But it's
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:32.400]   that comfort. You feel at home in that opera. I agree. I agree. Here's Steve Ballmer from 1986,
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:39.600]   talking about Windows. No. Leave audio? Just turn up a little bit.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.160]   Watch this Windows interface. Loaders 1, 2, 3, win.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.000]   This is a bad rip from a VHS tape, but I have to apologize. It looks like porn from the
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.280]   YouTube. You saw our salesman. This is obviously a joke that was made for a Microsoft sale.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.800]   A little bonus joke. But he's selling Windows 3. Or actually, this is Windows.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.280]   It's got a gasket. It's an important calendar. A card file. A note at a clock. A control
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:07.600]   panel. A terminal. A principle or a van driver. And can you believe it? Reversity. That's right.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:17.680]   All these features in reverse. We all forget how much did you get? 500? 1000? Even more? No,
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:24.320]   it's just $99. That's right. It's $99. It's an incredible value, but it's true.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:32.160]   It's Windows from Microsoft order today. Pio box, 2, 8, 6, DLS. It's kept in the basket.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:37.040]   Very strange. It's amazing that Windows 1 had more capability than Apple Watch.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.360]   Well, isn't it amazing? You know, I'm trying to do sarcastic. No, I think you're right though.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.200]   One thing you have to praise Windows 1 for it. Never told you to stand up.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.320]   Our show today brought to you by Let's Take a Break. We'll come back with more.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:58.240]   Great panel. Aaron Griffith is here from fortune.com. Always nice to have you. You lost your toilet
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:04.960]   paper. Mike Stan, what happened? Oh, yeah. I had a little time to plan ahead and actually
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:11.840]   get back the professional Mike Stan that had been borrowed. So, yeah, I actually, I was thinking
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.240]   maybe there would be some disappointment that we didn't have the artisanal cardboard makeshift
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:22.000]   one from last time. There is. That's awesome. Sorry. It was very impressive. Did you make it
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.600]   yourself? No, my fiance made it. It was. And that's why she's going to marry.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.600]   David Carvrier.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.520]   Taped cardboard and a really crappy regular Mike. Yeah.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:40.080]   Dan Paterson also here now with his new job. I'm really thrilled to see him join up with Jason
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.760]   Hunter, another one of our favorites at tech republic.com. And Alex will have no one knows
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:51.040]   where he came from. Swamp, actually. Swamp lands. He's a tech crunch. I'm a trinna-able baby.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:59.520]   And has the best Twitter handle of the bunch at Alex. Don't follow me. He says,
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.440]   our show they brought to you by lynda.com. L Y N D A dot com. It's a great site for people like
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.120]   you, people who I know people watch you were asking before the show. Aaron, why do people
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:14.560]   watch this show? Because people like to learn. They're curious. They want to expand their minds.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.680]   And that's what lynda.com does. If you want to take better photos, you want to learn to code,
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:25.520]   you want to learn how to use that app that your boss is expecting to use tomorrow at work. L Y
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:30.720]   N D A dot com and has everything you need to feed your curious mind. What's nice is you pay once,
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:37.760]   one flat rate once a month, and you have access to all 3000 plus on demand video courses. You
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:42.320]   don't have to choose your major at lynda.com. You can dibble and dabble, do a little bit of
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.360]   Excel, a little bit of word, a little bit of negotiating, a better raise, a little bit of
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.000]   Photoshop. Oh, I love pixel playground with Bert Munroy. That is one of the best shows ever.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.640]   New rush, new courses just went up Excel tips up and running with word 2016. That's one of the
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:05.040]   things they do that's great. They partner with the publishers so that they have courses ready.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:09.280]   The day the new software comes out. So they were ready when Office 2016 came out.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:14.800]   Essential training for QuickBooks Pro 2016. There's a weekly series on communications tips
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.960]   that can help you hone your communication skills to deal with difficult people.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:26.080]   And influence, I was looking at you and influence others and confidently speaking public at a
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:31.360]   moment's notice. We are big Linda fans here. We have an account for the company because then a
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:35.840]   lot of companies do that because we, our staff wants to learn more about how to use Premiere,
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.240]   the editing software they use or anything. We like it. We like for them to be able to take those
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:44.640]   courses. Every course comes with a complete transcript so you can search for anything you're
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.120]   looking for and jump right to that part of the course. You can of course download tutorials,
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:55.440]   watch them on the go on iOS and Android. Here's the deal. Go to Linda.com right now. Linda.com/twit2
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:02.800]   l-y-n-d-a.com/twit and the number two. And you've got 10 days. You could get 10 days free.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.520]   Could give you, you could get a whole course in 10 days. You could touch a few different courses.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:18.640]   l-y-n-d-a.com, use the offer code twit2. I don't know if there's anything to say about this now or
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:25.280]   not. We were talking about Windows. Of course, Windows 10 is the current version. The, I guess
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.200]   they're calling it the November update, which is actually a very big, almost service pack.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:35.680]   A service pack for Windows 10 went out this week. But Ed Bot has pointed out that
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:43.840]   the ISO that Microsoft offers for download on their site suddenly got changed.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:52.880]   They were pushed, you know, you can upgrade normally or you can go to Microsoft's site and
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:59.840]   get the ISO, which is a file you could turn into a bootable disk or something. For some reason,
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:05.760]   actually, I'm going to go check and see if Ed has written an update to this. But for some reason,
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:14.720]   initially, Microsoft was offering that version of the ISO, the updated version for the ISO. And then
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:23.840]   it disappeared. And they went back to the July 29th edition, the fifth version, I don't know,
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:31.760]   I don't know, 15, is it 1511? The upgrade option worked for a week. But then this weekend,
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:38.800]   the new files were pulled from the download server. Well, if Ed Bot says it, it's true.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:45.120]   Yeah, it's very good. So here's the update, which I see now, a Microsoft spokesperson says,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:50.160]   yeah, it was intentional. It wasn't a JK long event.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:58.240]   The November update was originally available via the MCT tool. That's the ISO. But we've decided
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.440]   that future installs should be through Windows Update. People can still download Windows 10 using
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:09.280]   the MCT tool if they wish, but they'll get, I'm parenthesizing here, they will get the older version.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:15.920]   And then the November update will be delivered via Windows Update. Very strange. Ed says that
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.680]   explanation is hard to accept nine days after the company encouraged people to use this tool
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:26.320]   for upgrades. It's pulled with no explanation. So here's what I think is going on. And I'm a
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:30.800]   Microsoft watcher to some capacity. Not as good as Ed or Mary Jo Foley or Tom Warren, but you know,
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.400]   I'm with that career a little bit. And I think the Microsoft is currently figuring out how to do
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:38.720]   this, because going back to seven and eight, eight dot one vista, the whole crew, I mean,
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:42.640]   they were doing these really episodic updates. And now they're doing a much faster cadence.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.520]   And I think there's a lot of cobwebs that knock off their cycles to actually do this. And so this
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:51.840]   sounds like a oops, a mistake or something they had to fix along the way, but nothing that's
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.080]   really nefarious or too negative. But I mean, there's definitely growing up and there's growing
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.960]   pains involved with that. I mean, I'm not surprised to be here. That's so true. And seeing, you know,
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:06.480]   interdepartmental communication styles that haven't happened previously, I do believe this new cadence
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:12.000]   of Windows is such a right way to phrase this period that they're in. They are totally, or they're
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:18.800]   trying to do something that is totally outside of their corporate memory or ability in the past
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:22.640]   to do. And I think that this is something like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:30.720]   doing. I think there might have been a technical issue of some kind with that update, right?
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:37.920]   But that's where Microsoft, I agree with you both that the new Microsoft is really kind of shake,
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.800]   you know, Satya Nailala has shaken things up. They communicate better. But one thing they're
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:48.560]   still bad at maybe even worse at is communicating with the public. They just, they just don't know
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:53.600]   how to tell their story very well. No. And when things like this happen, they shut up, they don't,
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:57.280]   you know, people have questions. And the response is nonresponsive.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.840]   Do you give a shout out to this? So one of their guys, Gabe Owell, Gabe is great.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.520]   Gabe is great. And follow him on Twitter because that's about the only person at Microsoft who's
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.360]   saying anything. I call him Nerd Jesus. He doesn't like that very much, but there you go.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:13.600]   I think they've ruined a good job in the last year of becoming a little more transparent and
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:18.320]   a little more open. And because I talk to them pretty much every day. And I felt a change in
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.040]   the winds, if you will. And they're trying. They're definitely working. They're never going to be
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.560]   Apple level cool because they're Microsoft. That's cool. It's fine. They make a lot of money,
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.360]   whatever. But I think certainly over the last, you know, cycle of windows, there's been so much
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.400]   more disclosure and transparency that I had a much more fun job covering them because I'd
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.760]   know more stuff. And I let his name again, Alex, Gabe, all a U L.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:41.440]   A ball.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:48.560]   A U L also a carry called Jesus. I don't think he calls himself. I call him that, but he's at
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:56.240]   gay ball on Twitter. And yeah, he's followed. Apparently, you know, he's with the engineering
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:01.200]   team. He's a vice president and apparently has been somehow given some dispensation.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.280]   To speak. Well, the right guys, I met him before this whole week.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:05.760]   Oh, he's a great guy.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.800]   He's actually an actually nice in person too. Ask him about the fairy incident and the red car.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.440]   I've had a chance. I can't tell more than that, but ask him.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:21.280]   Well, you know, we've had him on Windows Weekly and he was very, very smart and fun. And yes,
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:27.120]   he's a good communicator. He has nothing to say about this particular issue. In fact, his last tweet,
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:34.160]   which was yesterday says the windows or two days ago says Windows 10 mobile build 10
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:37.280]   586 dot 11 is now available on the slow ring.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:42.000]   But who's the only favorites I got? I mean, this guy's tweets have become like gospel for
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.160]   Microsoft fans. It reminds me a little bit of major Nelson Larry Herb, who's been the guy who's
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:51.200]   kind of stepped forward on the Xbox side to the Apple equivalent of that or the Google equivalent
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:56.320]   of that Apple is way too controlled to let an individual have a voice. Okay.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.240]   So the mobile Google Google has Matt cuts who we've had on many times who's well back.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:07.760]   Matt is like employee 10. So he has a certain amount of kind of freedom to speak. But Google,
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:12.000]   like Apple really does, you know, we try to get an interview with somebody at Google.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.640]   They've always got to go through PR. They've always got to get approval. And it often ends up
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:21.760]   being not approved. So where Microsoft, you can DM their executives and they will respond without
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:26.240]   PR is fantastic. Try that. Gabe apparently doesn't tweet over the weekend. Somebody's telling me
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:33.120]   good man, he has a life. How dare I like him even more now? Sorry. I don't tweet on the weekends.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:40.160]   But we are still wondering and it may be nothing at all. But why did they pull the November update
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:46.160]   from the might media creation tool? All of a sudden, I think there's a bug. Okay. I think
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.240]   there's no shame in that. So far, it's hard. And as far as we know, there's still offering the
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:56.000]   update. If you if you have not yet received the update to 1511, you should get it. I got it
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.400]   on my surface book a few days ago. It doesn't seem to really it fixes some things. It doesn't
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.920]   seem to change much. Do you like the surface book? Love it. Okay. I'm excited to. You know why I love
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.120]   it? And I'm really convinced touch is really more important than Apple gives anybody credit for.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.160]   And even though Windows was not really designed to be a touch OS, in fact, all of the things we
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.560]   hated about Windows 8 were because they were trying to add touch. They went back to the desktop.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.160]   However, you know, even right now, I'd like to be able to scroll the browser up and down with my
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.280]   finger. There's just times when you want to reach out and touch it. I really hate that I agree with
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:38.320]   you here, but I do. Well, what's what's interesting is Apple has decided that they're going to have
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:45.760]   a kind of replacement for the desktop is a massively huge iPad Pro. But they all never put touch.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:55.040]   Tim Cook has reiterated we're not merging iOS and OS 10. And we're not going to put touch on OS 10.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:01.280]   This is their touch first operating system. And I have to say I am. I kind of would like to have
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:07.200]   a MacBook with touch. Am I am I you and I are the only ones? I talked too much. No, I totally
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.240]   agree. Yeah, let Dan weigh in on this. I don't have a strong opinion. You don't care.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:19.840]   No, I mean, OK, fine. Do you use an iPad? Do you use an iPad? I tried to do real work on an iPad
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.040]   before and it was horrible. Yeah. And this was a couple of years ago. And I'm sure that it's gotten
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:31.600]   a lot better since then. But I just desperately wished that I had a laptop. And you know, I think
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:37.440]   the surface probably does a really great job of merging those two. And if Apple tried, I'm sure
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.360]   that they could do a great job too. But they've decided that they don't want to. Yeah. I mean,
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.960]   do you guys actually believe Tim Cook when he says that both would be
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:51.360]   have less functionality and be worse off if they kind of converge them?
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:57.120]   Damn. No, I don't believe. No, no. I think I think he says that until it's until
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.000]   happens to them to change. Yeah, that's actually how Apple works.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.520]   Then he's also using credit. No one reads books and then bam, I books. So, you know,
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:11.040]   right. Yeah, I think. In fact, I mean, I've been convinced of the utility and
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:16.080]   right. I can't do work without a keyboard. I need a laptop. However, having touch in a laptop
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.200]   is an incredible thing. The two actions do become one. I use my muscle memory and my
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.640]   typey hands for typey things. And then I scroll when I need to scroll.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.320]   I don't have any trouble with mixing those two metaphors. And Apple also kind of says,
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.480]   oh, it's too far away. You're at arm's length. You're not going to want to touch this. And that's
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:39.840]   just not been my experience. I have a Chromebook pixel, a Google Chromebook with touch. It's just
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.640]   natural. Everyone's want to want to scroll or touch a button. You're not going to use it to
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.160]   close the windows because those targets are too small. But you kind of, I think you can internalize
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.120]   that. And it and I seem to have found a nice hybrid way of working that really fits me. The other
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.880]   problem is, of course, as we use tablets, we get used to touching the screen and then you touch
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:04.400]   your laptop screen and nothing happens. I hope you're right, Dan. I hope it's just Apple saying,
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.760]   oh, we're never going to do that until they do. Well, I mean, I have a sort of the office. I
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.800]   want a Surface Book and two Apple cinema displays. So I've got two 30s Apple screens in my Surface
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:17.440]   Book. And I always kind of the best of both worlds. I'm a bit of a traitor. But I always almost
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.880]   touch the Apple screens by accident because I presume they're also touched that the Surface
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.640]   Book is. And they're not. And I always get a little surprised by my inability to kind of keep
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:29.920]   that mentally constant. But it depends on it. I really do care. Humans are more flexible than
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.640]   they're giving us credit for. Okay. Good article by Lauren Good, by the way, in the
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:39.200]   Verge, speaking of the iPad Pro, the iPad Pro has an App Store problem. And we actually
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:45.520]   have been talking about that on Macbreak Weekly for some time. The iPad Pro calls for high-end
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:52.080]   pro apps that take advantage of the pencil, the real estate touch. But the problem is the
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:59.200]   structure of the app store discourages developers, the kind of developers who might want to make
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.640]   an app for the iPad Pro are not going to because there's no demo. They have to charge more than the
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.280]   app store really encourages. One example she gives is a program from Bohemian coding. It's called
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.760]   Sketch. And they, the founders of Sketch, the designers say, we are not going to make an iPad
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.720]   Pro app. It's a Mac desktop app. It would be exactly the kind of app that Lauren says that you
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:30.000]   think would work perfectly on the Pro. But two months ago, one of the developers left a comment
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.200]   saying that they have no plans for an iPad Pro. Yes, a version. Yes, it has a beautiful screen,
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:41.760]   but there's more to consider. Apps on iOS sell for, and this is the key for unsustainably low prices
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.120]   due to lack of trials. We can't port Sketch to the iPad if we have no reasonable expectation
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:53.680]   of running back our investment. And we wouldn't ask people to pay $99 for an iPad app if they can't
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:00.640]   try it free first. Some people solve this by making a kind of a freemium and an app purchase. So you
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.960]   get some features and then if you buy more. And I'm not sure why they don't do that.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.480]   But he says, we're a niche app. We have to pay. We have to charge enough to make up
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.520]   for the lack of volume. Why not have the problem? That seems like a really easy problem to solve.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.240]   How? Yeah.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.120]   I mean, couldn't they just start? Well, Apple could solve it.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:25.520]   Preview. Yeah, Apple could just say, okay, here's a way to preview these apps and apps are problem
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.600]   solved. Well, I think Lauren's right here. I think they're going to have to solve it,
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:37.840]   or the iPad Pro is going to die stillborn because the iPad Pro is without specialized apps. It's
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:44.080]   just a giant ass iPad. And it doesn't, I'll show you, it doesn't even take advantage.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:53.200]   iOS, for instance, I've got a 12.9 inch screen here, but the icons for iOS are spread way out.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.600]   They didn't give me a bigger grid. So I've got all this, what is all this space?
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:05.760]   They've made no concession, in other words, to take advantage of the real estate. And I can live
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.240]   with that if I've got pro apps on here that are phenomenal. And there are a few, there's Pro
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.680]   Create, which is an amazing drawing app. And as soon as Apple comes out with a pencil,
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:18.560]   which they still haven't done, or I guess they're slowly dribbling them out in the store,
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:24.560]   this will be an amazing way to draw. So there are a few things. I'm not an artist, though, and
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:30.080]   maybe, maybe you're a 3D artist and you'd want to use Sketch, or maybe you're a musician and you'd
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:36.000]   want to use a high-end music composition program. There's a really nice program on the surface
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.760]   that they showed off when they released the Surface Book and the Surface Pro 4
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.640]   that allows you to compose. Oh, yes, that's all this. It's an amazing program. And one of our
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.440]   engineers, Alex Gumpel, study, composition, and college. And so he brought it over to show me,
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.160]   what is the name of it? I can't remember. But you get a staff and you start drawing notes,
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:02.160]   and it turns the notes into a score. It'll play the score for you. And this is the kind of app.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.240]   Yeah, you'd have to charge a hundred bucks for it. And would he worth every penny of it?
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.840]   Every single penny. Like Finale or one of these high-end programs.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:14.480]   But I don't know a staff tab. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't... PS Chops and the
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:20.400]   Chairman's telling me staff pad. But I don't see this... It would be wonderful on the iPad Pro.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:26.640]   Will they put it to the iPad Pro? If they can't recoup the investment of developing it, I don't know.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   And that would have happened. I think it's going to hurt it. The other thing Apple could do is just
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:36.080]   supplement some of these app developers with some seed investments. I know they've never
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:42.480]   done that. They're very... We're the platform. But I don't see why. If this became a real problem
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.840]   for them, I don't see why they wouldn't say, "Okay, we'll give you some money upfront and help you
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:51.040]   recoup it," or we'll change this one tiny little feature and let people preview the apps. I think
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.640]   Apple could fix both of these pretty... Yeah, that's only work if Apple had a lot of money.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.920]   Unfortunately, it's not going to be possible for them to be. One of Apple's responses to this
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:07.040]   complaint, Apple said it paid $10 billion to its developers in 2014. That's through sales in the
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:12.720]   stores. Developers have made $33 billion to date from the sales of apps and games.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:17.760]   Real numbers, big numbers. Big numbers. Developers get 70% of revenues, of course.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:25.200]   Ben Thompson has talked about this too on his blog. But that's fine if you're a $5 game.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:31.120]   That's great news. It's not so great if you can only sell a thousand copies of a program because
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.040]   it's such a limited audience. 100 bucks, 100 gs. 100 bucks, that might make it. No, it's
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.280]   for real. But I'm curious why they have bad terms here. Why don't they anticipate this kind of
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.600]   developer reaction because they've been so good at building out a developer advantage by your 10
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.400]   years ahead then? I'm curious why they made this mistake and why it seems a level of blowback.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.920]   Because this is not news that Apple doesn't know. We've been talking about this for a long time.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:59.120]   For instance, if you make an app and you charge 99 bucks and you want to charge for the next
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.360]   version, the app store has no mechanism for doing that. Which is insane. Apple has a lot of
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:07.680]   really incredibly smart software engineers. They have the biggest app store in the world.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.320]   They lead on this. And yet they're falling down a little bit. Is this a lack of external
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.040]   input to their process? Is this hubris? I wondered why this happens.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:23.920]   Because there's such a very good question. Yeah. And these are seemingly such simple
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:29.040]   solutions. In fact, historically, Apple worked before the iPad came out. They worked with
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.400]   developers that they favored the New York Times and others. I don't know. That's a great question.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.800]   Why did they go to market with a product without getting a premium experience from a half-dozen
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:47.920]   premium developers? Yeah. Well, there are a few. They showed a few. We've actually demoed
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.920]   the one that was used to design the 3D printed car. There are a few. But I think that they're
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.080]   going to need more than that to really sell this in quantity. Or maybe not. Maybe they say,
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.640]   hey, an app that sells a thousand, sells a thousand iPads. We don't care. That's not enough.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.960]   Do we think the iPad Pro and its current version is a real mass market device with more of a trial
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.280]   balloon? Well, that's kind of what I've been saying. Maybe I'm wrong. But I feel like this is a
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.640]   specialty product. Okay. Because it does look really fun. I mean, just sitting here buying it.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.280]   It does look fantastic. I want to touch it. I want to play with it. It looks really cool.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.920]   I mean, I don't actually need to. I'm fine. But like, it's definitely an appealing package.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.040]   You know, I mean, the first surface for example is not. The surface RT was not very good. A lot of
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.760]   ideas but not an execution. This looks like the full deal. But I don't really care as much as I
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.200]   thought I was going to. Is there a larger question here? Because now we've talked about two different
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.240]   companies, Microsoft and Apple, that it seems like we can see something that they don't see.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.200]   What is it? Well, it's always easy in hindsight. Is that it? I don't know. Here we are sitting on
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.720]   the sidelines. It's easy for us to play a morning quarterback. I mean, we get accused of that all
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.320]   the time. That's kind of our jobs. It's fun. That's why I do this and I don't build computers
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   or software. Yeah. But I mean, they have telemetry. They have focus groups. They have research. They
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.560]   have teams, product teams by the dozen. They've got thousands of employees and billions of dollars.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:11.440]   And so when they make a mistake, I don't feel the need to be polite about it. I don't feel
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.520]   the need to pull back my Christmas haul. Also, to be fair, they probably spend a lot more time
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:21.200]   thinking about this than we do. And they have a much bigger dog in this hunt. This is their business.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.360]   Shouldn't they be experts better than any of us at running their business?
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.480]   I don't know that maybe that's that. Maybe it's not in Apple's DNA to really understand
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:38.960]   or care that much about professional use cases. They have lots of professionals using their
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:44.880]   stuff, but they don't actually have to go in with the big enterprise sales pitch and really sell a
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:49.680]   big organization on this kind of thing. So they've kind of worked from consumers and trickled up
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.320]   to companies buying their products. And this is kind of another example of that,
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.160]   where they're kind of starting with the consumer friendly thing and not really considering the
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.760]   changes that they have to put in place in order to make it appealing to a business use case.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:09.040]   Again, Aaron, I'll do that comment. Well, what we're going to do is take a break when we come back
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.840]   another example of a massive company making changes to a product that dismayed the users
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:25.200]   and nobody cared. But first, Audible.com. I want to talk about my favorite place to get books. I
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:31.200]   don't read anymore. I have I got the new Kindle and I put books on it, but I find I'm so much happier
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.440]   listening to books. And I don't even have as much time as I used to. I used to come do a lot of
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.560]   you doing you taking a selfie? Look at that disgruntled report behind you. You were supposed to know
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:47.840]   I don't have I used to have, you know, two or three, maybe four hours in the car every single
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.800]   day committing to San Francisco. That's when I first started listening to Audible back in the
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:57.040]   year 2000. And I still love Audible. I get two books every single month. There's an
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.480]   Ariana Elvis cut there's something for everybody. So are you an Elvis Costello fan? Who isn't?
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.560]   Jason, did you get this book yet? Unfaithful music and disappearing ink. I didn't get this
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:12.480]   one. I got the Billy Idol autobiography actually. Oh, you know what? That sounds good too. And
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:18.080]   it's read by him and it's it's awesome so far. It's exactly what you want it to be. This is a new
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:25.600]   course. Of course he called it what? Dancing with myself. Yeah. This is kind of a sub genre
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.080]   of biography or autobiography. I'm really enjoying it. Audible has a lot of them. I read Keith
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:37.200]   Richards life my life. Graham Nash's book. And it's really fun as these guys now are kind of
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:43.120]   looking back at their careers to read these books. Look, Johnny Leiden, Anger is an energy.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.400]   Here, let's hear Billy Idol reading a little bit from Dancing with myself. It's like putting
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:54.640]   yourself in a temporary coma for three hours to observe us. It appears as if you're gone from this
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.440]   world. What's in that void? I know. According in 1988, that's a man who's lived life. Is that
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.720]   single to the four men? To the foolish gold? I mean, seriously, when I saw that this was there and
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.200]   that he read it like I didn't even think twice. I got it. I was like, I know this is going to be good.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:18.720]   Who is good at all? Oh, he's I'm just going to show your picture for a second so that we know who
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.520]   asked you know who Billy Idol is. I've heard the name. I've no idea who he is. Wait, my question is,
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:30.320]   did Keith Richards, did he read his book? No, but he they found somebody kind of better things to do.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.800]   Well, you know what's funny? This is strange. This thing happens in this book. It's called Life.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.560]   And they got to hear I'll play a little bit of the narrator because they got a narrator who
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:45.040]   sounds like Keith. And here we were. Oh, no, this is so it starts with Johnny Depp. Oh, this. Oh,
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.720]   okay. That's what's happened. It's really weird. So Johnny Depp reads and remember, Johnny is a
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.800]   huge Keith Richards fan. In fact, he bases his pirate in the Pirates of the Caribbean basically
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.480]   on Keith Richards, right? That's it's Keith Richards with a braid. But so Johnny reads the first
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.880]   chapter. And then this other guy comes in who's great Joe Hurley who sounds much like, but then
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.840]   at the end of the book, like the last couple of chapters, Joe Hurley says, and now Keith Richards.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:15.840]   And Richards reads the last two chapters. So it's so much fun. It's so much fun. I, this has become
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:22.800]   a genre now. I love it. I listened to all of these. Eric Clapton, another good one. Simon Vance,
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.360]   who's one of their best readers does this. But one of the things you find with Audible, of course,
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.440]   the person reading it is huge. And a lot of times, authors are not the person to read their books.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.880]   But when you're listening to audiobooks like, you know, Mick Fleetwood's autobiography,
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.720]   he's a little bit in here. You kind of like hearing from their voices a little bit.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:49.280]   But most of the time, you probably don't want to hear like, Lynyrd Skynyrd reading whiskey bottles
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:55.680]   and brand new cars. Actually, that sounds very appealing. No, no, but if I wrote an autobiography,
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:59.200]   no, my bikes, I'm very boring. But I would, I think I'd have you Leo. I think that I have your
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:08.000]   soul to read. Silver Fox. Hey, I'm Alex Wilhelm. I fell down the staircase. I am a madman.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.840]   Bob Odenkirk. Hey, now Bob Odenkirk. Don't you love him? Better call Saul. And he was awesome in
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:23.280]   season one of Fargo as this as kind of the dumb sheriff. His book, A Load of Huey is a collection
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.480]   of new short humor fiction from the Odenkirk Memorial Library. It's called A Load of Huey.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.480]   A Load of Huey. I thought it was a man. There's a lot of funny stuff in here.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.840]   I cannot, I cannot recommend Audible more highly. It's, I'm a huge fan, as you all know.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:44.480]   I recently did a blog post with all 400 books I've ever read on Audible. If you want to 400,
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.880]   something like that. Yeah, right. 401 books. Yeah. I'm a big reader. I love it.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.920]   There you go. Well, that's the nice thing about Audible because you can listen at times when you
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.160]   wouldn't normally be reading like in, as a commute or on the, in the gym, I'd spend a lot of time
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:02.400]   with the treadmill. Audible really gets me through those. So let, oh, new one from Roger Angel. So
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:08.240]   let me just recommend you go to audible.com/twit and the number two, audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:13.840]   And you can get two books for free. You're gonna sign up for the platinum account. That's a
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.760]   two book a month subscription. That's the one I have. You also get the daily digest of the New
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:24.000]   York Times or the Wall Street Journal, your choice. Oh, new one from Tom Petty. That'd be fun to hear
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.720]   his story. And, and you'll get those first two books, but you'll pay nothing in the first month.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.360]   The nice thing is you can cancel anytime in the first 30 days, pay nothing. But those books will
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.680]   be yours to keep. They're in your library from now on. As are, as are all the books I've ever
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:42.960]   listened to on audible.com. So audible.com/twit2, please do me a favor.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:49.120]   Check it out before I see a movie. Before you see the Martian, go to audible.com and listen to the
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:54.480]   book. And then go to the Martian. It's an amazing, yes. Oh, the audio book is so good, though.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.000]   Yeah, great. Wait, Dan, read the book first or I'll just read the first. I did the audio book
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.440]   about a year and a half or so ago. The audio book is just, it's great. It's, it is exactly like
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:10.880]   you're saying, Leo. You can consume that anywhere. And with the Martian, it is everywhere. Walking down
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.000]   the street in the car. I mean, that's a really nice memories of the Martian. Yeah, like,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.120]   short chapters, it's fun. It's like, I have really nice memories of it because my wife and I listened
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:27.280]   to it together in the cars. We were driving on the road to Hana and Hawaii. And it was so much fun.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.720]   We were listening to this book. We're going through this beautiful scenery. And something
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.600]   happens when you're listening to books. You, you attach that portion of the book to where you were.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.760]   I don't know what it is, some weird sensory thing. So now when I listen to the Martian, it's like,
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.520]   I'm back in Hana. It's really cool. Anyway, we could go on and on. And we do, we usually do with these.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:51.920]   Because I love talking about books. Audible.com/twit2. Get your first two books free. And I see I just,
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:58.480]   the 22nd is my renewal day. So it just got two credits. So now I have to decide which of these
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.840]   many books I'm going to give you. Huh? You don't get free. You don't get free
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.320]   audible for all the ads. No, no, no. That's, that's parsimonious.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.360]   You know what? I never even asked him for it because, um, hey, they give us a lot of money for
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:13.520]   these ads. I'm going to, I can afford to pay for my own account. Thank you for the rent money.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:20.160]   But, but, but be, uh, I, you know what? I kind of like the arm's length relationship with the,
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.440]   with everything we review. Like I bought this iPad. I bought this laptop. I bought my phone. I,
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.240]   like, I, I kind of want to, I really get it. I really get it. Anybody like you who is in,
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:35.120]   you know, probably you don't get to do that. You get calls from PR, right? I try to avoid them.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.080]   Nothing worse. This is why I don't read email. Not reading emails. When I hear from them. Yeah,
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.840]   I don't, I want PR out of my life. Is that from my, my girlfriend does PR, but,
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.000]   aside from that, you know, I'm fortunate enough that, uh, you know, having been in this business
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.680]   a while now, I can afford to buy the products review and, uh, that's worked out nicely. So,
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.840]   if you need money, call Leo. No, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying, he's available some of
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:05.760]   his weekly, you won't have to do this. Um, oh, Google plus is the product I was talking about.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:11.120]   I was on the edge of my seat. Yeah. Yeah. Big company doesn't listen to users, makes massive
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:18.560]   change. And then the irony of this is crickets, although the regular users of Google plus were
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:24.160]   incensed about the new design. I'm not sure why. I mean, all of them. I'll say that's the problem.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:30.640]   Um, they were really, there's a, there's a similar, uh, situation with Yahoo. I guess,
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.120]   Yahoo shut down some message boards thing they had like three years ago. And I still get
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:42.480]   raging, angry, angry, this is going. Yeah. This is probably going to just kick up another whole
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:47.840]   series of them, but constantly these people who are like, we, this was our lives. We invested so
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:52.480]   much into these communities. It was very niche. Um, and that's probably very similar with, uh,
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.200]   with Google plus. I guess there's a lesson there. Uh, though, if you create something that people
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:03.280]   use, even if it's only, you know, if it's a small number, internet wise, like a million,
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.360]   that's still a million people you're going to peeve when you, uh, kill the thing.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:15.360]   Yeah, but it's Google plus. I mean, just, I can't even stop it. Google plus is a great thing. Yeah.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:23.600]   It's a, it's a thing that we use week three years ago. Yeah. I like Google minus. They turn it into
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:30.080]   Pinterest basically. Oh, really? Yeah. I don't, you know, you know, I wish that they would make it
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:36.160]   better and, and something that I, that I felt like I was really compelled to use because it
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:42.320]   ranks so high in search, right? Like the handful of things I shared on Google plus in 2011,
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:49.600]   are still on like my first or second search page, um, or, you know, if you search for my name or
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:54.560]   something. So, uh, I would like to make it more active and not things that are from
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.800]   the famous the Robert Scoble test. If Robert Scoble still using it, you shouldn't. And, uh,
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.720]   cause he's not using it. I don't see. I'm just giving a hard time. No, but Scoble was a big
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:08.400]   fan of friend feed and Google. I love friend feed. Uh, I actually love Google buzz. Google
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.280]   buzz was amazing. But, uh, and I like Google plus, but I, you know, if you, I guess it shows up that
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:18.080]   you can make a good product, but if people don't, like if everybody, you know, doesn't use it.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.800]   The same as the opposite. Sometimes it's a bad product that everyone uses. So it's kind of
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.560]   ironic. Why is snapchat a bad product? It's not a problem. It's possible to use the UI. It's
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.320]   designed for use. It's not designed for use designed for 18 year olds. No, I have, I have
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.520]   a series. Okay. I agree. I think it's a poor UI and I think it's intentionally poor. I think
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   that the entire purpose of using snapchat is to end you into doing things they want. It's a very
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:48.080]   manipulative ecosystem. Uh, and also I think they don't want it to be, um, your, I don't think they
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:54.960]   want your dad to use it. So, um, you know, I asked my son because I have, I, you know, I, I like
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.040]   you Alex. I thought this is, I can't figure this out. And I said, do you guys have any
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.800]   trouble? So no, no, we all, you know, we love snapchat. We know exactly how to use it.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.000]   I think they teach each other, right? The swipe and all that stuff. Yeah.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.160]   I think that's part of it. Dan, what, uh, what action do you think they're trying to
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:16.560]   manipulate us into, into doing? I think they're trying to get us to use the system that they, and,
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:22.960]   and rules that they determine as opposed to rules that are, uh, good design principles. So
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:29.200]   if we, if we do things their way, we become more invested in their ecosystem as opposed to just
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:34.080]   doing things away, any social app would. And so it gives us more incentive to return and, and to
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:40.560]   become a repeat user. We have to think about it more. Yeah. But it also makes it more, um,
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.840]   more distinctive. You know, they don't have every, every other social network looks exactly the
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:52.160]   same. I mean, even on Twitter with turning likes into, or faves into likes. Yeah. So I think, I,
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.600]   I'm saying exactly the same thing. You just said it more eloquently. Um, yeah.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.120]   I'm sorry. I'm playing with. Leo was literally sitting here playing a snap. Like a 14 year old
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.120]   Wayne, his first iPhone, playing all the sound effects. We were having a serious conversation.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:10.320]   I'm dying. I think Snapchat has, you know, by the way, interesting monetization strategy on Snapchat.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.680]   So they released initially, they released for free these, uh, overlays, right? If you played with
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.560]   that, oops, I, I swiped out of it. I don't want to buy that lens because this is the new
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.040]   monetization strategy. So you're doing, you're doing a selfie. Yeah. They sell lenses. All right.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.400]   So you're doing a selfie. You press and hold your face for a while. I'll stop talking.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:33.440]   Hey, demo gods.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:39.520]   That's not going to be their main way to make money though. Well, I don't know there. So the
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:46.800]   idea is they have these faces and then they retire them, right? Oh, it's the short term. Yeah. And you,
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.640]   and if you get attached to one, you can pay 99 cents to keep it forever.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.520]   Aaron, do the fidelity isn't pressed by that. Is that one of their investors?
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.280]   There was a bunch of headlines over this last news cycle about fidelity marking down
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.640]   some of their holdings and some of their highly valued startups. And one of them was Snapchat.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.320]   That's kind of what kicked off the whole news cycle. I forget. What was the haircut? Like 20%?
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:16.640]   Yeah, something like that. 40% of them are on there.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.320]   Fortunately, it's a really good job actually covering this entire cycle. So points to you all.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:25.280]   Yeah, my colleague Dan Perman has definitely been all over it. Leo, can you?
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.400]   There was another story. There's another Reuters story this week, actually, that
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.080]   outlines, snaps, problems, and other things. I couldn't hear you. Leo was making unicorn sounds
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:42.560]   gay. Money for that. Yeah. You know what? You know what? They gave you for free flies buzzing
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.320]   around your head. That doesn't seem like, you know, come on. Yeah, that's free.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:50.480]   Look at your house, you know. Nice. Aaron, I'm curious. Where do you, I mean, is this,
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:56.000]   look, Tencent has made billions of dollars with stickers and in-app things.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.800]   This is awesome. I believe it. I can't hear you. He's still doing it.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.520]   It's like old man. There's a lot of training of dance. It's freaking sad.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:10.640]   Okay, so I, what's your Snapchat handle at Wilhelm? I'm going to tell me to terrorize you, buddy.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.920]   Here's how I'm literally, I actually forget. I haven't used it in like a year.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.720]   So no. No. I'm, I'm Aaron Griffith. What about them? You think the, you think the
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:24.560]   Griffith on Twitter? Do you think the, the, the discover, didn't you guys use that for a while?
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.200]   I feel like Fortune had a discovery channel, didn't it? Oh, God, no. Fortune?
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.560]   No. Do you think any of Fortune's readers are on Snapchat? Do you think Fortune's cool, Leo?
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:37.360]   Come on. Everyone knows it's not cool. Oh. I didn't say that. It's like Boy Scouts. No, no,
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.120]   don't put words in Aaron's mouth. She wants to keep her a job. But no,
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:47.120]   to answer your question, Dan, I agree that, you know, a lot of the, the Asian messaging apps have
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.240]   built huge businesses on things like stickers and emojis and that kind of stuff. So it can be a
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.640]   big business, but I don't think that's what Snapchat is ultimately going after. I think that's a nice
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:02.080]   to have a piece of revenue similar to how Facebook had nice to have Zinga money when they went public.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.040]   I think deep down though, they're building an ad business and that's what they want to
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.640]   become, you know, their big source of revenue. They're looking to take TV dollars. That's a much
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:18.000]   bigger story to tell investors and that's what got them the $16 billion valuation.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.720]   Do you think they'll be successful in that strategy?
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.920]   I mean, I agree at least externally with what I see, but I have no idea about the potential.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:31.440]   Snapchat, if you talk to anybody under 25 is totally dominant with the young folks.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:39.040]   That is their go to place that Instagram tumblr. Yeah, maybe a little tumblr tumblr is a
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:45.600]   no, it's a pass. Yeah, I think Snapchat really dominates and I base that only in my kids who use
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.280]   it all the time. Yeah, that doesn't mean they're going to be they're going to build a huge,
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.680]   awesome business on it. That's still, you know, they haven't proven that yet, but I think that
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.680]   they have a pretty good chance. Thanks to Katie Benner. I've learned a new a new term.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:04.480]   You've heard of unicorns. She's talking about unicorpses. Yes. Yes. And a great article in the
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:10.960]   Times this week on living social, a cautionary tale to today's unicorns living social raised a
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:16.240]   ton of money. It was the hundreds of millions. It was one of the first. Almost a billion.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.120]   Yeah, it was one of the raised a billion, which gave them, of course, evaluation of more than that.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:26.560]   One of the first unicorns that is a private company valued at a billion dollars or more.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.600]   Their valuation got to four and a half billion. Wow. I didn't know that.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.520]   They raised more than 800 million dollars. This is an example, though, of groupthink, right?
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.440]   And Snapchat might be a little bit of that where everybody says, oh, yeah, yeah. The next big thing
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:46.000]   is group on slash living social. And then the whole idea of these, you know, deals by coupon just
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.360]   died. It was a bad business model. It was it was totally a fad. Well, and also was
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.320]   challenged. There was a challenging business model because you had to put salespeople in every
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:02.080]   Berg and every town and every city. And so they had 4,500 employees, but almost all of them are in
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:09.680]   sales. Yes. Trying to sell these, you know, these coupons. Groupon got to go public and raised money.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.000]   So well, I was in Chicago, actually, when they were living social, it was too late. It was a weird
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.160]   moment because everyone thought they were the next Jesus and it turns out they were not. But in
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:21.360]   that time period, they're growing so fast. You know, we had a running joke in Chicago in the
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.760]   Texan and titled what a group on by recently that was dumb. They would just put weird stuff in the
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:30.720]   office like, Tony is just weird, weird things. So they had so much capital flying in. And now to
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.240]   see this is kind of the absolute end of that story. And I'm kind of a little bummed out because
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:38.240]   these were good companies, good people. They worked really hard. But the ultimate model is Aaron
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:44.000]   just said doesn't work out. Well, and Snapchat, one of those unicorns that if, if, you know, fidelity
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.640]   is right, maybe starting to see the end of the line dropouts, by the way, here's the thing about
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.840]   this reality. Yeah. Yeah. The thing about the Snapchat thing though, is that we don't actually
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:30:00.080]   know that we don't actually know how they are marking their valuation. Because if they're just
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.400]   marking it to market as in, you know, comparing it to companies that are publicly traded,
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:09.520]   who are they comparing it to Facebook and Twitter? Is this other media companies who have taken a
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:14.960]   huge hit because of Snapchat and worries over cord cutting over the last year? So it's kind of,
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:22.400]   basically, it's like they're getting investments from mutual funds, who are kind of looking at
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.240]   them like public companies with fluctuating valuations. And they were used to having one
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:31.520]   single valuation, you know, regardless of what happens, little blips in the market. And so they're
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.040]   kind of experiencing that. I don't think that that means that we should kind of count them out.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:38.320]   It just means that it hurts their narrative on their way to going public.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:43.440]   It's also a little weird to see institutional investors buying pre IPO companies. That's
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:49.920]   very risky, isn't it? Well, I mean, it's a tiny chunk of their overall portfolios. I mean,
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:58.080]   these guys have these people have portfolios that are managing hundreds of billions worth of dollars.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:02.960]   So, you know, one tiny little one billion dollar investment in Snapchat or less than that 400 or
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.440]   something like that is kind of, you know, and if they can double their money in a couple of years,
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.760]   then why not? I mean, it's very useful though for us. I mean, external observers that we are,
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   I mean, to have these numbers come out helps me and y'all just really kind of get a better
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.400]   grip on where these companies are going and so forth. I mean, the whole narrative that
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.000]   Dropbox was worth $10 million was hard to assail externally because you didn't have the actual
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.320]   revenue numbers and so forth. But when they do this sort of thing, we have a little more data to
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:32.400]   fight with and I'm thankful, you know, I totally agree with that. We only have the information they
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:37.200]   give us because they're public at least in the first dot com bubble. We knew how much money these
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:42.240]   companies were burning. I mean, people didn't care, but we at least have that information available to
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:48.240]   us. And then there's Square, which everybody, in fact, we talked about, oh gosh, they're going to
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:54.720]   IPO is going to go off below their most recent valuation. This is a terrible, terrible thing and
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:02.480]   Quartz writes Square's IPO achieved something that hasn't been seen in 17 years. Price below the
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:13.120]   target range and the prospectus and then it went up a lot. 45% in the first day. So this actually
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:20.080]   was good for everybody, right? Square was able to pay back people who I think was at $97 million.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.960]   They had to pay back. You don't pay back. You provide liquidity.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.440]   Provide liquidity. Yes, which is the the dork way of saying that. But I was so the Square
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:31.840]   IPO number at $9 to share was really terrifying because their range was 11 to 13, which is also
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:36.720]   already very conservative. So when they soon had that $9 number, it showed a lack of, I think,
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.560]   enthusiasm among investors on the professional side and then on the other side, it worked out
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.400]   pretty well. But you know, Aaron, when you watch this day one, were you surprised by the chump or
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:49.280]   do you think it was relatively expectable? I actually didn't really watch it that closely,
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:55.680]   day one. But in retrospect, because I was like I said earlier, closing this other story, but
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:02.880]   in retrospect, I look at it and it just seems kind of just overly conservative that they're
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:07.280]   more concerned with the story of having the big pop and getting to say that we're the
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:14.240]   highest trading for day one IPO in 17 years. That's obviously great to be able to say.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:20.640]   It's way better than being able to say we're the most priced to perfection IPO
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:29.280]   in the last two months. So it seems like it's just a little bit of game playing in order to have
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:33.760]   this positive narrative as opposed to having it trade down and everybody say, oh, Square's a
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:40.080]   dud, write them off forever. And it's a distraction. But it's a sacrifice too because Square only
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:46.560]   gets the $9. They don't get the pop. Right. Well, I mean, they have to hold. So at all the insiders,
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:52.000]   you know, have a lock up period. So we'll see if in 90 days or however long the lock up period is,
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.440]   if the shares stay up. Here's their CEO, Jack Dorsey taking one of his trademark selfies.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:02.160]   He gets half of his head in this selfie. Very handsome man. I had that draw line.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:07.600]   Well, at least half of his head. There we go. Half a draw line. Half a draw line with the IPO.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:13.600]   Does you? Sorry, yeah, I cut you off. You're leaving money on this. Go ahead, Dan. Go ahead.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.720]   I cut it off. How did this happen? Is this is this a KG strategy that was pulled off by the people
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:24.880]   who prepared and packaged Square's IPO? Was this dumb luck? Was I mean, it's it seems like for this
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:30.160]   to be such a rare occurrence, especially with a company like Square, there there's part of the
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:36.560]   story that I don't understand. And I don't know if it's just for lack of knowing the details or
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.560]   are there some smart people doing pulling some smart strings here?
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.280]   Well, you have to fill the book. So with the Zendesk IPO, I was told by two different people that the
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.200]   IPO almost didn't happen. And so they had to price very conservatively to actually get the
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.640]   IPO on the door. Just to get it out the door. And there, he's just had to buy it chunk of the book.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:59.760]   Yeah. I mean, Jack lost $730 million on his valuation with a $9. But Zendes' IPO went gangbusters
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.520]   when it came out. It's very popular. But just to get it done, to get the actual IPO completed,
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:07.440]   they took a real haircut. And so I think probably if I had to guess, this is a guess,
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.720]   it's a similar circumstance that's we're seeing right now. So that's my take error.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:16.880]   That is so interesting. Yeah. And also, I mean, if you just look at it in the context of the
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:24.000]   other tech IPOs that have happened this year, the investors haven't been super jazzed on most of
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:30.960]   them. And so I think it makes sense to kind of be a little bit conservative. This felt sort of
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:36.720]   like extreme conservatism. Very much so. But it'll be really interesting to see because there have
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:42.400]   been so few tech IPOs this year. And there is a little bit of a pent-up pipeline for companies
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:47.840]   to actually go public. It'll be really interesting to see if that strategy continues or if it's unique
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.520]   to Square. Yeah. Also, one last data point before we move on to actually things that are interesting.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:56.080]   But if you look at Square's S1, their first document they filed, the numbers looked pretty good.
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:02.000]   They didn't look at their S1A. They're refiled S1, then another quarter of data. It was very
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.480]   much weaker. It was not as good. And so I think we discussed this IPO to keep in mind that
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.080]   they put a lot of points on the board and then retracted a little bit in their last offering.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.600]   So I think that people are a little more skittish about their finances, their margins,
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.880]   revenue growth, the whole thing. And so I'm not shocked that this is where we ended up.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:30.640]   And what about Tinder's IPO? No comments. Sean Rad, the founder and CEO gave kind of an intro.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.520]   I thought it was quite a good interview to the Evening Standard. But apparently the folks at
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:40.240]   Tinder had to disavow him and say, "Hey, we don't know this guy. We never heard of this guy. Who's
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.920]   this guy?" What about it? What about it? Did you think was good?
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:52.800]   Yeah, I was fairly honest. I don't know. I didn't see the problems. Look at it. It's a hookup app.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:59.360]   Do you expect this guy to be Jerry Falwell? Yes. He should not be an idiot. He's apparently an idiot.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.760]   I should be a professional. Yeah. Yeah. Not totally sexist. He's kind of a bro.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.320]   Little guy. But it's Tinder for crying out loud. What do you expect for Tinder?
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.280]   That's true. I would like him to be professional. I don't expect it. Sorry.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.600]   Yeah. But just because you have a... Low expectation?
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:23.200]   Just because you work in a maybe CD industry, which I don't necessarily even know if I agree with
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:30.080]   that, doesn't mean that you aren't expected to be a professional human who is aware of what other
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:33.680]   people think of you. Yeah, but they did throw him under the bus. And by the way, the vice president
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:40.000]   of communications and branding, Rosette Pambachian was sitting right next to him in this whole interview
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.960]   and didn't at any point put her hand over his mouth. He thought that if you like intelligence,
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.760]   the word sodomy, he's an idiot. Well, have you ever read a book? He like twice maybe? He didn't
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:55.520]   know what sodomy meant, but I thought that was kind of endearing. He's... No! That's not endearing at all.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:00.240]   That is horrifying. Like, have you read any history whatsoever? Like, I don't know. Maybe like the
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.960]   Bible was once like, come on. This is a level of lack of intelligence that I find shocking.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:10.160]   It was hilarious. I laughed all morning at this interview, but if that's your guide, this is the
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:14.560]   CEO. I'm not gonna put him up there. It's not my guide. I'm not buying tin or stock. I just surprised
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:20.320]   that the company would throw him. I mean, he's the CEO. Throw him under the bus. This is not the first
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:27.760]   time he's done things before, though. I mean, he was initially fired, wasn't he, for some kind of
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.960]   sexual harassment situation. Yeah, you know, a little harassment thing, you know. A little harassment
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:36.960]   thing. Well, you know, you're not doing so well in the last two minutes. You might want to just,
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:45.360]   you know, okay. Okay. Aaron, keep going. No, I'm done. Okay. Anyway, I don't... When is Tinder's IPO?
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:50.880]   And where can I buy some? You can buy it on the NASDAQ. It's called Match Group.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.120]   M-T-C-H is a tech resemble, and they had a very good first step. Did they? Yeah. See? They've
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:58.800]   learned him. Well, I mean, can you... Here's the thing. That's because he's not the CEO of the whole
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:04.560]   company. He's just the CEO of one. It has to be very fast growing. What else does Match Group
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:08.960]   do? Put me a fish, match.com. Aaron, what else? What is it?
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.800]   I don't match.com. I don't know.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.040]   Also, match.com. Tender. And plenty of fish is another dating site. Yeah, and they have a couple
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.120]   of them. It's a dating site called Plenty of Fish. Who here online dates?
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.480]   Pam? No, girlfriend. Okay, Sam. All right. Aaron?
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:33.600]   What? So... Okay. I don't even... This is free, right? P-O-F. God, it's the ugliest site I've ever
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:39.120]   seen in my life. It's kind of like Twit.tv. Hey! I mean, I do know. Snark it off.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:45.680]   If you're in a major city, you're using one of these apps, or if you're single. I mean,
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:52.560]   that's... I think that they've become pretty ubiquitous. And I mean, I don't know that I would even call
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:57.920]   Tender a hookup at this point. It's just the new okay-keep it. And they also own okay-keep it, right?
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:03.360]   Oh, do they? All right. Oh, okay. So if you're buying their stock, actually, you're buying love.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.280]   So there's nothing wrong with that. There's a guy about shares with subscriptions. How do you
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.760]   feel about love? I feel good about love. I'd buy stock in love. Wouldn't you buy stock in love?
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.440]   It would forsake me. Well, I don't know about your personal life. But I'm not saying...
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.240]   Well, but not saying love. How could you... How could you go wrong buying stock in love?
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.560]   I'm not going to comment on that.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:31.760]   Those are not the assign. Aaron, I want to talk about Marissa Meyer.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:35.840]   Okay. There's been some talk that maybe the end of the line is nigh.
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:43.760]   Yeah. And that's been the talk for a while, but it seems to be getting quite a bit louder in recent
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:49.120]   weeks. Yeah. And there's even some reports I think that said that she could be out by the end of
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:52.480]   the year. Wow. Well, we'll talk about that. She should be sitting down gracefully.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:41:00.480]   Save your powder. We'll talk about that in just a bit. Also, RDO will say a fond farewell.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:08.080]   But first, a word from Wealthfront. Wealthfront solves a conundrum for all of us. You've got to
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:14.400]   save money. I mean, your mom told you that. You've got to save money for a rainy day, for the down
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.480]   payment on your house, for college, for your retirement. The problem is you're not going to put
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.480]   that money in a savings account. Maybe when mom was saying save your money, that's what she was
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:29.360]   thinking. And maybe in those days when a savings account at four or five percent interest, maybe
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:32.880]   you could. Nowadays, you put money in the savings account. You're basically losing money.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.960]   So that's not going to work. What else do you do? You put it in the stock market? Well,
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:41.600]   as you could probably tell from our discussion over the last few minutes, this is an unpredictable
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:47.040]   place. Are you going to manage it yourself? Or maybe you're going to go to one of them fancy guys
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.640]   at a brokerage or a financial advisor who's going to charge it between one to three percent of what
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:58.000]   you have under management every year, not to mention the hidden fees for transactions and changes.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.760]   You're back. You might as well put it in the savings account. You're making nothing again.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:07.200]   That's why I love Wealthfront. Wealthfront lets you save for your future. It's long-term
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:14.320]   investment management, but it's smart. First of all, it's done by software. So it can do things
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:21.200]   that are very sophisticated. It trades in ways that individuals usually cannot. Things like tax
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:26.400]   loss harvesting and direct indexing. Ask your investment advisor, "Hey, what's tax loss harvesting?"
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:30.720]   And watch him look it up as quick as he can on Wikipedia. Listen to the typing in the background.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:36.240]   With Wealthfront, you get great management based on some of the best minds in Wall Street. People
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:41.760]   like Burton Malkiel who wrote the random walk down Wall Street or Charles D. Ellis who wrote
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:46.560]   the Investors Guide. I mean, these people have taken more than 200 years of investment experience
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:51.840]   and distilled it into the Wealthfront software. And whether you're investing for retirement or
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:55.920]   any long-term goal, they automatically will take care of you. They'll rebalance your portfolio,
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:03.440]   they'll reinvest the dividends all commission-free. They minimize your tax bill by maximizing
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:09.760]   your tax loss harvesting. They do direct indexing a lot of very sophisticated stuff. With Wealthfront,
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:17.920]   the cost of this one quarter of 1% a year. What? Not one quarter of 1% a year. And there are never
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:22.960]   any commissions or hidden fees. So you're paying less than $5 a month to invest, let's say, a $30,000
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:29.360]   under investment, less than $5 a month. And no additional charges for any of their services.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:33.840]   That's one of the reasons Wealthfront has grown 20 times in the past two years and now have
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:40.160]   worth $2.6 billion under investment. And you can find out exactly what Wealthfront would do on your

[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:50.560]   Dan Patterson, I think you're more Mr. Pandora. I was
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:57.520]   audio for years and years and years and years. And Aaron, I'm thinking you're an Apple music person.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:06.320]   No Spotify. Spotify. Yeah. I use Google play and Spotify both. I think I can't decide.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.520]   I can't. I'm stuck. I like to discover music on Spotify, but I like it that Google Play has all
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:16.160]   my Beatles albums so I can listen to the Beatles. Oh, what are the Beatles? You never heard of them?
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.680]   Never heard of them. That's Sergeant Pepper thing once, right? Yeah. Okay. Awesome.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:27.040]   Rario was the first, believe it or not, the first, it was it came to America a year before
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:31.360]   Spotify was the first streaming music of service of that kind in the US.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:38.960]   They did never get the size of the catalog up. 7 million, I think, at the end.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:45.120]   Whereas Groove Music, Microsoft, which I think is the biggest still 30 million Spotify close to that.
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:51.440]   They never really got the subscriber base that Spotify or Pandora had. In fact, according to
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:57.440]   Hollywood Reporter, they were losing $2 million a month. Yeah, that's terrifying. I had some friends
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.160]   that worked there as this was a little personal to me because they didn't hear about it very far
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:07.600]   in advance. Yeah. And so it's been tough to talk to them through this. But no, when you have Spotify,
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.200]   which is the independent winning category provider right now, and also you have Apple,
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:16.480]   Google, and Microsoft all in the space, you have to be so different to survive that I'm not shocked
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:21.520]   that this happened and disappointed in a lot of ways. But I didn't wake up and go, "Oh my gosh,
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.560]   I never thought this was going to happen." But the rate of loss was terrifying, the debt is terrifying.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:34.000]   $220 million in debt. I mean, this is a chapter 11. I don't know how they got there. It's impressive.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.680]   I can't borrow five bucks from my friends, but you know, $2 million is all good.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:41.920]   Well, but I think a couple of, I think takeaways from this. First of all,
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:46.000]   this is a tough business to be and the record industry can squeeze you and they don't like you,
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.040]   right? I mean, Nadell just announced, "I'm not going to put my album 25 on any streaming service."
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:55.360]   And she knows she's going to sell more albums because people will have to buy it. And she's got
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:01.280]   a big enough base of users that they will. And the record industry get decides how much money you make.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:08.160]   Also, you're competing against companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, maybe Amazon that don't
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:14.560]   need to make money in their music services, right? Those are value added plays for those companies.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.440]   It's a platform player. I mean, if you're Apple or Google or Microsoft, you want to
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:21.200]   have to provide everything. You want to do apps and music and operating systems and hardware.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:27.280]   You want to do the whole vertical stack. Well, that means to me that Spotify might be next on this list.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:34.080]   I think Spotify will not die. Either because purchase or ideas. I mean, Aaron, what do you think?
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:41.200]   Do we ever have a final user number for RDO? I mean, was it like insanely small?
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:45.440]   It was. And because I think every person that ever used RDO would
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.960]   tweet about it nonstop about how superior it was. And I charted it a few times and I could never
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:57.840]   quite see the benefit of it over Spotify. I mean, the design was a lot nicer. Spotify always
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:06.960]   I thought was faster and sort of worked better. But I don't know that they had a real differentiator
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:14.880]   to begin with. Spotify has critical mass. They have, I can't remember what the latest is, maybe 40
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:20.160]   million, 50 million users and 20 50 million Spotify, 70 million with 20 million people in
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:26.960]   Denver. I think I think RDO's you're exactly right. They didn't have a differentiator
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:30.640]   eventually. But they did because they were the first, I mean,
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:36.000]   emusic kind of was subscription. And then audio was the first in the States. I remember
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.720]   Spotify a long time ago was was nascent. But audio was the first in the States. Their
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:47.840]   differentiator was that, Hey, you can do this. You can pay money and stream this music. I mean,
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:54.480]   La La kind of did it before the Apple acquisition. But you're right, they weren't differentiated
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.160]   later. But they were initially because they were the only place you could you could
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:03.360]   stream or you could pay a subscription. Why couldn't they capitalize on that down? What was,
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:08.960]   what held them back? You would probably know better than I would. But just as a consumer,
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.800]   I think that all of the things we just hit on, which is they didn't iterate, you know, for whatever
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.320]   reason, whether it was management, vision, a ton of different things colliding, I don't know,
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:25.600]   but they did not iterate. They did not change. I remember speaking to them for a little while and
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.520]   talking about, Hey, podcasting something that could set you apart. And they just had to double
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:36.160]   down on what their core competencies were. I assume that over time, it was because of lack of
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.560]   management, lack of capital and competition in the marketplace. And really you guys might know
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:47.040]   a lot better than I would. Interestingly, Spotify, Google, Apple all are incorporating podcasts. I
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:54.080]   think part of the issue is that the record industry, you're basically based on a business, you know,
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.280]   you're you're piggybacking on a business that hates you. That is not a good place to be.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.000]   Frank, a little margin piggyback. Yeah. And at any point, the record industry could squeeze you
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.720]   harder. And this is why Pandora, I think is in a lot of trouble. I mean, this is the exact
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.880]   argument. One of the reasons they, one of the ways they squeezed our videos by keeping them
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.960]   from going to seven to more than seven million cuts, right? They just said, no, you can't license
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:21.200]   that stuff. And why would you sign up for RDO if any everybody else has 30 million?
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:25.920]   The music industry has to be one of the absolute most backwards things ever. And I keep trying to
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.080]   understand how they're still so bad. And yet they're still just as bad as I thought. So,
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:37.040]   I think frankly, Spotify loses more money than RDO. But they might have more runway.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:41.520]   They definitely are. Ultimately, this is challenging. Pandora bought the intellectual property and
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:47.680]   hired some of RDO's employees. They plan to do a streaming service next year. But I think Pandora
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:52.880]   has complained for years about how hard it is to survive. Spotify doesn't complain, but you got
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:57.760]   to think they're suffering a little bit. It's going to, and I promise you, in two or three years,
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:04.640]   we're going to, it'll be Apple, it'll be Google, it might be Amazon. And it might be Microsoft. I
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:07.840]   think Microsoft could stay in the business, but they probably won't. They didn't afford to do it
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.320]   forever. But Pandora was so desperate to get around to some of the royalties that were so punishing.
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:15.360]   They actually bought a terrestrial radio station. Like an actual...
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.080]   Except the company.
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.000]   UKB4, whatever it was, Dan probably knows. But I mean, they literally bought that so they could
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.120]   have access to this in theory, lower rates for streaming. And they got busted up in court. But
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.840]   they are hell-bent. And that's okay to say on the show.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:35.840]   It just makes me sad because I love Spotify. And I think that these services consumers love.
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:41.600]   The artists don't seem to, and record labels don't seem to. So I just have a feeling they're
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.240]   not going to be long for this world. What's on four?
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:45.200]   What's on four?
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:45.200]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:51.120]   No, no. So Leo, you might have just touched on the reason. And Alex, you as well, with,
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:55.680]   look, the music business, we can say the music business when we're talking in very generic terms,
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:01.920]   but more than almost empty any other media business, the music business is not one industry.
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:06.640]   Right? You have the publishers, ASCAT, BMI, and CSAC. On the one hand, licensing the music,
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:12.560]   you have the record labels which used to sell mechanicals, right? The actual disc or the thing.
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:19.440]   And now, they've kind of functioned as banks that will roll cash out to artists, but those are all
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:25.120]   loans. And then you have the artists themselves. So you have all these different competing interests
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:31.120]   within one industry and trying to corral those cats is just impossible. I think the other,
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:36.400]   you know, mediums, movies, television, you've seen a consolidation of the rights interests.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:40.720]   And so it's easier, a little easier to do negotiations for that.
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:46.800]   Yeah. So are you advocating almost for a vertically integrated record label?
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:53.200]   No, I think, I'll tell you what, I'm advocating. The record labels are a dinosaur. We don't need
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:56.480]   them anymore. What do they do? They paid so you could get your record produced. You don't need
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:00.960]   that anymore. They've got to pay back. Yeah. And of course, the contracts were always
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:06.560]   famously, horribly, you know, in the favor of the company and against the artists.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:12.160]   And they haven't changed them to adapt the digital world. The ironic thing about all of it is that
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:19.600]   as a Spotify consumer, or I mean, premium subscriber, I now pay $120 a year to music,
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:24.400]   which is more than the average CD buyer bought in the height of the CD boom.
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:27.280]   Right. So there's money going in, but where does it go?
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:32.640]   But it's just split across so many more artists now, because if I buy one CD,
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:36.320]   I'm going to listen to that a lot, but they don't actually know how often I listen to it.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:42.240]   They don't care at that point. And now it's like every, the pie of artists that I listen to is so
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:47.280]   massive and they're split into tiny, tiny little slivers that they're not seeing that same big
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.960]   $12 or $20 CD chunk that they would get if I bought the album.
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:55.840]   Admittedly, artists are still kind of a dream of signing that record deal, but I think artists
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:59.760]   might have to start thinking about that. That is a deal with the devil.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:05.680]   And I feel like if you're, the opportunity here is to reinvent the music business,
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:09.200]   for artists to find a new way to reach their audience. I think reaching your audience directly
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:13.920]   is going to be the key. And I just think that we need to get the middleman out of there,
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:18.720]   because frankly, the most of the money that comes from Spotify, billions of dollars a year,
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:22.240]   and Pandora doesn't go to the artists. It goes to the labels.
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:29.440]   And if you have a problem with not making money from Spotify, you probably ought to ask your label.
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:32.480]   Where's that money going? It's going to them and not you.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:36.000]   As it always has. I'll always ask. But if you look at a label like Strange Music,
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.560]   which is the biggest independent hip-hop label in the world, they run their entire thing top to
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:44.320]   bottom. They do their own merchandise, their own tours, their own records, their own studio.
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:46.720]   And so they have this entire thing out. That's what you have to do.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:52.240]   And they're doing great. But I mean, naming it on the label, it's like that. I mean, it's rare to see.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:57.040]   And so there's a lot of individual artists like Jonathan Cole and Umphry's McGee. There are a lot
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:04.640]   of individuals who are actually bridging the gap to their audience and selling direct their
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.960]   audience. And doing, OK, they're not going to be platinum sellers. They're right. And it may be
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:13.680]   that those days are gone. Yes, that's exactly right. That's a reality of the music business.
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:18.640]   That if you want to be rich and famous, what you want is to be rich and famous. It's not to be.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:25.520]   If you can make a really great middle class income by packaging everything yourself,
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:29.440]   but you're not going to be rich and famous. And you know, who wants that though? I mean,
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:32.720]   no one goes, I'm going to be a musician and take over the world. No, you become a musician
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:35.440]   because you love music and you want to be an artist. And if you're a music, you know,
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:41.440]   if you're an artist and you can make a living and be middle class, that's good. And that's,
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:45.040]   I think that's something to celebrate. I don't, I think you don't need to be Metallica.
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:48.880]   Speaking of which, Metallica actually found their own label and bought all the
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.400]   over accordions. They own their masters. And boy, that was black and smart move, wasn't it?
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:00.960]   But they don't have the money. Melissa Meyer has lost the narrative, writes Aaron Griffiths
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:07.920]   in Fortune magazine. Is there a drum beat now? I, this makes me sad because, of course, Yahoo
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:14.000]   is, I think probably in hindsight, was an unwinnable war, saving Yahoo.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:20.880]   I think that a lot of people would agree with you there. Yeah. And I love Marissa Meyer. And I
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:27.920]   thought I really was rooting for her to succeed. But it may have been a job that, you know, no one
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:34.400]   could do. Well, that's what her activists, shareholders now think. I mean, they first told her,
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:40.080]   okay, we need you to spin off these Alibaba and Yahoo Japan shares. She did it. And she's like,
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:45.680]   okay, whatever, whatever I can do to get you off my back. So I can continue trying to fix this company.
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:51.600]   And then, you know, last week they decided, okay, you know what, actually, never mind.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.760]   That sounds such a good idea because you might have to pay a lot of taxes on it. So why don't you
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:04.080]   sell Yahoo and keep Yahoo Inc, the stock that we now own, as a shell company that owns shares in
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:11.040]   Alibaba and Yahoo Japan and has $5.5 billion in cash, which is just kind of nonsense if you
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.440]   think about it. And so I'm sort of convinced that the activists have run out of good ideas.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:20.800]   The shareholders don't think there's any way that Marissa Meyer can actually pull this off.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:27.600]   And she's probably going to have to step down soon. But who do they pick that's going to be better?
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:29.760]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Aaron, you think she'll step down soon?
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:34.240]   Well, there's, I mean, we were talking about this a little bit earlier. There's been some
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.480]   kind of reports that people are speculating that maybe by the end of the year she could step down
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.880]   or that. When's the filing deadline for the presidential election?
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:47.520]   She wants to step down before that. That's actually a very good joke, Leo.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:53.280]   Your first one's fine. I'm serious. I mean, seriously, I would vote for Marissa Meyer.
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:56.640]   It'd be a lot easier to run America than it would be to run Yahoo. Oh my gosh.
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.960]   Oh, I don't know about that. That is a, I'm not sure that.
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:05.360]   Okay. Step one, don't listen to activist investors, right? Right.
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:12.640]   But at the same time, I mean, the activist investors have so much power now.
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:18.560]   And basically, I mean, she already succeeded by getting Dan Loboff of her board. So she's like,
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.880]   all right, I made this guy happy. I got rid of him. I'm going to do it again.
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:29.280]   Who's starboard? Starboard. Is it Jeffrey Sonfield? Is that the guy's name?
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:32.000]   So this is one of the activist investors at Starboard.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.880]   Yeah. You know, it's really tough though. Like when we sit here and kind of armchair quarterback,
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:39.360]   Yahoo, I think any one of us was the CEO and she-
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:42.800]   I couldn't run this company. No, no, I think we would have done kind of the same thing.
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:44.720]   Yes. I mean, she had a focus on football and-
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.240]   Well, okay. That's part of the problem.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:52.800]   She didn't have a focus. She, I think, you know, if we're going to criticize her performance,
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:57.360]   she couldn't decide if Yahoo was a services company or a content company.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:03.760]   She didn't have a focus and she didn't focus on enough of the real strengths of Yahoo to pull it back.
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:07.280]   I mean, it was a tough company. I think you probably spin off a lot of it.
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:10.640]   Yeah. I mean, go ahead, Dan. What do you think? What would you have done?
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:16.720]   I, you know, we- this is armchair quarterbacking, but I do think that her strategy was all over the
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:21.280]   place. I think that she, you know, all of the reports coming out in the first couple of years
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:27.360]   were that she alienated a lot of people. And it, you know, she has a nice reputation coming from
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:31.840]   Google, but she's also said some things that show her management weaknesses.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.880]   Yeah. Rico and Cara Swisher specifically has been-
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:35.840]   Yeah. And I think she-
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.720]   recounting the departure of executive after executive.
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:42.720]   Yeah, exactly. And I think that, that what she probably should have done is,
[01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:48.560]   is maybe put her head down a little bit and learn some executive management, some sea level management
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.800]   skills that you just don't have inherently because you were successful at Google.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:57.440]   Success in one place does not guarantee success in another place. And if she was truly the
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:02.080]   smart, brilliant person, you know, humility is part of that. And saying, you know, look,
[02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:06.880]   I need to learn some skills and I need to actually turn this company around. Simply throwing money
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:10.800]   at Katie Currick is- I mean, I worked at ABC News. I know it's not a solution.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:12.560]   Oh, man.
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:14.480]   Aaron, I'll take that.
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:22.560]   Aaron, I'm curious. What do the activist investor- what do people in the know? What will Yahoo be?
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:29.920]   It is right now just the sad mishmash of things that we used to like, but what is the future of Yahoo?
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:36.320]   I mean, that's the problem with activist investors is that they don't know how to fix a tech
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:40.240]   fix a tech company, especially when you- it's one thing. If it's like, okay, cut costs,
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:46.240]   divest some industry or divest some segments, but this is like you have to be innovative.
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:46.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:50.800]   So you have to think of things that, you know, haven't been thought of before. And that's not
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:56.320]   the specialty of an activist investor. So they're- they've kind of run out of ideas.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.960]   But as CEO wasn't an incumbent on Meyer to come up with a coherent strategy.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.720]   Exactly. I don't think she ever laid out a strategy.
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:06.000]   Part of the reason that they brought her in was because, okay, they had this option.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.800]   They could have brought- they could have elevated Ross Levinson and, you know,
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:14.160]   made Yahoo a content company, a media business, which is basically what they are. And- or they
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:18.000]   could bring in Marissa Meyer, who they viewed as this product visionary who could, you know,
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:25.200]   come up with new products and sort of reinvigorate the Yahoo's old products and turn it into an
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.640]   innovator again. And then she got there and she kind of started doing that a little bit,
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.880]   but also she thought, oh, well, I'll do the media part too. And it turns out she doesn't really
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:37.280]   know that business that well. And she made these, you know, this Katie Kirk bed. And then, you know,
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:42.880]   we saw that she lost- or she wrote down $42 million for her investment in community and a couple
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.480]   other shows that she commissioned that end up being very expensive. And, you know, people are
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:52.320]   also even questioning Yahoo's fantasy football streaming deal and seeing whether or not the
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:56.480]   company made any money on that. So that's not an area that she has a lot of expertise. And she
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:01.040]   hasn't proven that she can pick it up really easily. So it seems like all along, they maybe
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:05.920]   should have brought in the media person who actually can make that into a viable business.
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:10.320]   Yeah, but here's my thought. Given all of that, I think your analysis is totally correct. But
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:16.640]   if Marissa leads, then who? Yeah. And that's- I don't have a single name on that list.
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:19.840]   I think what we're really saying is this is the beginning of the end for Yahoo.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:22.320]   Yeah. Well, it's at least the end of the beginning.
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:30.160]   I mean, they've gone through five CEOs now over the last decade. All talented people who basically
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:36.800]   went there and, you know, had a wall in their careers because they couldn't fix it.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:42.080]   As an observer, do you think it was her abrasive style that kind of was part of the problem?
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:48.240]   No. You know, she asked executives to pledge that they wouldn't quit.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:54.160]   I think that's just that management. I don't think I had to do it for abrasive style.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:03.120]   That's a great- that's a very interesting differentiator. That might be- might be less of a loaded
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:08.000]   thing to say, especially for a female CEO. I will say though, if you are at your campus on Friday,
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.880]   the food's really good and everyone brings their kids. And so it's kind of a fun,
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:14.560]   carnival atmosphere. It's a nice place. You get nice ass lovelies. Purple's a great color.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:19.120]   It's sunny down there in Sunnyvale. You know, it's lovely. But I'm just- I'm sad because I really
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:23.360]   hope Marissa was going to do well. I did too. I was just going to- I mean, she's way more than I am.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:28.000]   So I was pulling for her. But some of you- She's way- what? She's way smarter than I am.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.560]   Way smarter. I thought you said she weighs more than I am. Whoa, whoa, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:37.440]   It'd be very clear. Way smarter. Way- okay. I'm sorry. I'm holding my earrings back.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:41.200]   Yeah, you're like 85. You're my bad ear. It's okay. The point wasn't my bad.
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:44.000]   I thought she was going to pull it off. Well, you know, you invited me back.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:52.320]   I thought she was going to not only do well, but also carve out a big position as a female CEO
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:55.840]   in tech, which I was really excited to see. And I think the problems that, yeah, who would
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:59.600]   just too bait for any wubbers in the fix. I just want to say Steve bomber is available.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.400]   Oh gosh, he's not though. He has a basketball team now. Yeah, he officially has a basketball team.
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:07.840]   The Clippers are now his, the courts have ruled. And I hear they're really good too.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:15.840]   Last story of the day, in 2012, the Oxford dictionary is named the word of the year Jiff.
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:24.480]   In 2013, selfie. Last year's word of the year was vape. It's gift, not Jiff.
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:28.400]   Okay, gift, Jiff. I don't know if they're waiting on that. I will.
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:34.320]   The word of the year for 2015, can I have a drum roll? It's not a word. It's an emoji.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:42.080]   Face with tears of joy. How do you even put that in the dictionary?
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:49.200]   Satire is dead. Satire is over. Wrap it up. Is this LOL R O F L? No, this is, this is my suicide
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:54.640]   note and gift format. We're in a post, we're in a post text world. Apparently we are.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:57.920]   They're just catching up to that reality. Casper,
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:02.160]   Graith wall, president of Oxford dictionary says you can see how traditional alphabet scripts have
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:09.680]   been struggling to me struggling. They're failing to meet the rapid fire visually focused demands
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:16.320]   of 21st century communication. It's not surprising that a pictographic script like emoji has stepped
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:20.960]   into fill those gaps. Am I too young to say these kids these days? Kids these days.
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:26.640]   That's what's wrong. It's flexible, immediate and infuses tone beautifully. As a result,
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:31.360]   emoji are becoming an increasingly rich form of communication. One that transcends linguistic
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:40.080]   borders. The other candidates on the shortlist ad blocker, dark web. One for you, lumber sexual.
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:49.600]   How you doing? On fla, you doing on fleek. No, which I just, I do. You know, on fleek, I just recently
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:56.560]   learned that one. Refugee. I don't know this one, Alex. I'm glad you're here. Brexit, B R E X I T.
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:01.120]   Oh, it's the British exit from the EU. Brexit. Oh, British exit. I get it.
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:07.440]   It's the whole referendum thing of the. And sharing economy. That's what Uber takes all your
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:14.320]   money. Another another shortlist item, the word they and in a particular context when used instead
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:22.960]   of him or her, you want to identify a person as, but you don't want to give it a gender, you say
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:28.720]   they, which is, of course, ungrammatical, but there is no such thing as grammar as we all know.
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:34.400]   Yeah, that's my right. The language is changing. It's an emoji. It's one of the worst emojis,
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:40.320]   actually. Is it? Yeah, I'm not very emoji fluid, but you know, that's just horrible.
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:44.880]   Why? Why would you pick that one? It's not. It's not so nuanced. It's like L O L, whereas, you
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:48.560]   know, yeah, there's a lot of other ones that can say things that maybe words couldn't say.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:56.240]   Look at this website. This is emoji tracker. It tracks real time uses of emojis on Twitter.
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:02.640]   And the number one emoji on Twitter is in fact, the crime. That's because that's because kids use
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:08.720]   them three and three at a time. Right. So like how, you know, a harder laughing.
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:16.960]   Incidentally, it just crossed. Ready for this. One billion uses in the emoji tracker. We weren't
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:22.560]   here for that magic moment. It was only a few hours ago, and I'm sad. I'm crying. I'm crying now
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:27.040]   and laughing. Well, you know, I, if only there were an emoji that could express that. Look what
[02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:32.320]   you got. Look what you got. No, but we make our money, not you, but the rest of us writing things,
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:36.800]   right? Yeah. Literally, I did WSA. Can you use, are you allowed to use emoji at TechCrunch in your
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:40.320]   articles? Definitely. I just wouldn't have any sulfur specs. Is that count as a word for your 15
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:45.280]   cents a word? I'll get I'm on salary. I'm not paying by the word because I could bang on for years,
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:50.560]   man. I got to say it. But no, I'm just, this to me is the hieroglyphs compared to the written word.
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:55.120]   I mean, why is this an improvement? This is a way to get away from actually creating your own
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:59.360]   sentences and thoughts and paragraphs. Oh, I think it's more nuanced than a word. What is that?
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:05.920]   That's, that's insane. It's more. It's a hard, it's got 447,000 uses. It's literally a
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:12.000]   hard, 147 million. I mean, with a lesson, 359,399. I mean, right. I'm right. I'm right. I'm right.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:19.040]   Do you emoji? I just rule your kids. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. I try, try that tomorrow.
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:22.960]   My lead is just going to be like three emojis. Oh, emojis. It's the future.
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:28.880]   According to the object. I once, I once tried to, uh, tried to express the, I don't know,
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:36.320]   and announce it from the Fed in emojis. Yeah. Yeah. For the backstage fortune. I don't know
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:41.680]   if our readers go. The best part about this page is the, is the bottom. What do you think the least
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:47.440]   used emoji is on Twitter? Oh, one of those weird symbol ones probably. Uh, at the bottom of the
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:52.800]   emoji tracker is hard to get to. There you go. Yeah. The custom sky looking through your suitcase.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:09:02.640]   Oh, TSA hashtag, hashtag Isis. I don't know. It's very low. I don't know why only 26,485 uses.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:07.680]   It's gotten less used in the thing that has the train on the sky thing. Like that's, yeah. That's,
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:13.280]   that's really down there. Yeah. It's fun to see the ones that are. Yeah. Less used than 630.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:21.840]   Backwards CC got 41,000 views. Less used in ABCD. Empty actual physical mailbox doing checks those.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.200]   Yeah. And then we have just, what does this mean? What does that mean? That's a twits mission statement.
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:33.200]   It's the input symbol for symbols. Oh, it's a little meta for me, actually. It's very meta.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:37.280]   Can we keep you on? Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you so much for joining us.
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:45.600]   Aaron Griffith at fortune.com. Your big article. I can't wait to read this on the man who is working
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:52.080]   so closely with SunSan to run SoftBank, former Google executive.
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:53.360]   Nick Hosharora. That's right.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:56.400]   Keshar. What is it? Nick Hosharora? Yeah. Yeah.
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:02.160]   And I'm actually very interested to read this. He was. Yeah, it'll be out in a few weeks. Yeah.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:08.720]   Oh, oh, you're still working on it. Well, we're close. But old time you print magazines take a
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:15.360]   little time to close stories. So, wow. Now you guys heard of that.
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:20.640]   Is it going to be the cover? No, it'll be our investors. That'll be in our investors guide.
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:26.000]   Okay. No, I think SoftBank is a very, I used to work for SunSan because he bought
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:31.680]   Sif Davis. Oh, of course. Yeah. And he did that to learn more about the computer industry.
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:38.320]   Yeah. Very interesting. Fella, bright guy. And I'm not sure I really understand his strategy.
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:44.560]   He also bought recently Sprint. They have lots of money. And I think it's when did they hire?
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:48.240]   When did they hire Aurora? That's fairly recent. Yeah. Yeah. You're in half. Go.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:51.520]   Yeah. Interesting. Anyway, Aaron, we'll look forward to that.
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:59.040]   Follow her on the Twitter. She's @Alex or fortune.com. Just getting back. You know,
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:02.320]   it's all good. It's all good. It's really well. It's very important. Yep. He said he was at
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:06.640]   Aaron Griffith. So what am I going to do? Alex Wilhelm, great to have you from techcrunch.com.
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:12.160]   Never come back. And no worries. Just teasing. I love you. I love you, man. Hi.
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:17.280]   And of course, I love Dan Patterson. It's always great to see you. And he has landed at tech
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:23.520]   republic.com, which is great news. So much fun. And I love your beat. I love your beat. I think
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:29.520]   you're in a really good position right now because the world is changing. It's been a crazy couple
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:34.480]   years in startup. So it's a great place to land. And in fact, you know, this is not mine. I don't,
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:39.600]   I don't own this. This is something Jason and Lindsey have been doing. But they asked me to read
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:43.040]   speaking of audible and audio books. They asked me to read the audio book of
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:49.680]   Follow the Geeks. Oh, you're kidding. So in fact, Leo, I just finished. I'm about halfway done reading
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:57.680]   my chapter. Yeah. Yeah, your chapter. I just finished the Leo chapter. And it's, it's really
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:01.520]   interesting. I have a, you know, not what I'm using now, but a studio set up in my apartment
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:07.680]   here in Brooklyn. And I spend nights with my, with my reading of this book. And it's been a
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:12.640]   fascinating experience. Those guys did a heck of a job. I think what they did really interesting
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:19.200]   was the way they chose their subjects. There are 10 chapters, each of them, an innovator
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:23.920]   in, in one area. And look, here's the announcement. That's really great.
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:27.600]   Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't want to plug myself. I don't want to plug it.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.400]   Two have done great work. But the last chapter was somebody a lot of people may not have heard
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:39.600]   of a 15 year old entrepreneur Maya Penn. And there she is speaking at TED. So hey, a 15 year old
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:44.480]   speaks at TED. You got to have something to say, right? Very interesting chapter. You can read
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:49.280]   that now for free. And I guess because it's the last chapter, we're getting close to the book,
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:54.720]   ebook, audio book or hardcover. And I love it. Dan's going to be reading the audio book.
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:59.120]   That's fantastic. Those two are just great people. As are you guys, it's been nice to meet you and
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.840]   talk with you. Yeah, try to do one shout out. Yeah. Shout out to the Twit production crew,
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:07.920]   who are literally every time I'm here on Pointing Amazing. They are great. And you know what?
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:13.600]   They have a favorite ask. None of you. Oh, okay. Thank God. They would like all of you who
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:17.360]   listened to this show and all of our shows to help us out because as you know, the end of the year
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:22.960]   is nigh and we like to do best ofs in that last week of the year. And we want to do a best of
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:27.040]   Twit and many of the other shows. If you have a memory from the year,
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:32.800]   could be this show, but let's go back as far as you can remember, which might be last week,
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:39.520]   and go to twit.tv/bestof. We'd love to get your suggestions. Now, the form and ask for a lot of
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:43.920]   information, including like, you know, what time what time code was it? You don't have to know all
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:48.480]   that stuff. Just give us what you know. But we would like some ideas for the best of because we'd
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:53.840]   love to have some fun working on that and give you a fun episode at the end of the year.
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:14:08.320]   You took four years to say of there of tomorrow on triangulation. I'm really excited about this.
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:12.080]   We're going to talk to the founder of AMI. Remember America, Medigotrends? They did the
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:20.480]   biases for a PC compatible. He's now doing, they're now doing Android for Windows. That is awesome.
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:27.440]   If you play with Duos, it is awesome. It is awesome. You could run Android on your Windows.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:32.640]   Exactly. Exactly. S Shankar will join us tomorrow on triangulation. Don't forget,
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.960]   we had a fabulous new screensavers last night with Florence Ion as our coast. I'm

[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:49.440]   and the 17 year old Google science fair winner who came up with a cheap way to diagnose Ebola.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:54.960]   That's an important thing. In high school. That's almost important in Snapchat.
