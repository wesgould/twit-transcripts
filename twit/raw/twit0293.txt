[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.100]   The show that covers the week's tech news and boy that some of the biggest tech news just happened.
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.100]   Let's get our panel on and what a great panel it is starting in the upper left hand corner.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.100]   Mr. Kevin Rose.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100]   Well sir, thank you for having me.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100]   Is it safe to say formally of dig?
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100]   Uh, we can talk about that.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.100]   Alright.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.100]   It's safe to say that in some way.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:01.100]   I'll say founder, dig founder, a host of Dig Nation on revision 3, founder of revision 3 and blogger at, let's say he's a blogger now at KevinRose.com.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.100]   You can say that for now.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.100]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100]   I want to find out what you're up to.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.100]   We're excited to have you on.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.100]   A regular panelist we love having him on from the Houston Chronicle and the tech blog there, Dwight Silverman.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.100]   He's also the host of a great radio show on Pacifica in Houston.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.100]   Called, I can never remember.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.100]   Technology bites.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.100]   How could I forget?
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.100]   That's right.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   You've been on it a couple of times later.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.100]   Great shows, Howard, you are.
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.100]   It was wonderful.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:36.100]   Also with us, as long as we're talking about people who have lost their jobs or given them up.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.100]   I don't lose anything.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.100]   I gave it away.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.100]   He gained a, he lost a job and gained a, I don't know, Neelai Patel.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   It's so good to have you.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.100]   Hey, it's great to be here.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.100]   You were the big story last week, your resignation along with Joshua Topolsky from Engadget.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.100]   We were a minor story.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.100]   There was a much bigger story in the world last week.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.100]   It was, well, there was, of course it was.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.100]   But in the tech world, we led with you.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.100]   I guess, you know.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.100]   We had Ryan Block and Peter Rojas on and I said, "What's the story?"
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.100]   And they said, "Well, he's probably just got tired of blogging."
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   Yeah, I hate the internet.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.100]   That's a reasonable thing I'm going to do on it.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.100]   That's good.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.100]   I think it's about time, frankly.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.100]   Somebody gave up this thing.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.460]   And speaking of Inksdane, Wreck is Nick Bilton, who is the most hip with it guy in the world
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.340]   and still writes for a debt tree journal soon to be hidden behind a paywall, The New York
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.340]   Times.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.340]   Hey, Nick.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.340]   What's going on with me?
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.340]   I don't know.
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.340]   Interesting.
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.180]   But you'll be able to get it for free if you're smart about it, not that I'm condoning
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.180]   that.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.180]   No.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.180]   It sounds like you're condoning it.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.980]   Isn't that the problem with a paywall?
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.980]   Is that it really doesn't stop anybody?
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.260]   Well, I think it stops the people that don't know how to navigate the web in certain ways.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.020]   But I really don't think it's going to affect people as much as they anticipate.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.780]   I think that paywall is going to be pretty far back.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.020]   And there's going to be so many ways to get things that you won't really see it unless
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.700]   you're a really hardcore New York Times reader.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.260]   And in that case, you're probably willing to pay for it.
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.260]   Sure.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.340]   Well, I subscribe.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.140]   So I presume as a subscriber, I'll get a break of some kind.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.140]   Do you get the print, the old paper?
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.140]   Yeah, I do.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.660]   I get that big, thick, heavy thing on my doorstep every Sunday.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.020]   With it every day.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.860]   That Sunday wouldn't be Sunday with it The New York Times.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.780]   I subscribe, but I get it on this little guy right here.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.340]   Oh, you got a white one, huh?
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.020]   I got a white one.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.780]   You did it so that everybody would know you had an iPad too, am I right?
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.500]   No, you got to try that.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   I got the black one.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.700]   It's funny because the black frame makes it look like a bigger optical illusion.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.500]   It looks like your screen is bigger.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.380]   It's that extra optical inch.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.340]   What color did all you guys get?
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.660]   Kevin, what'd you get?
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.580]   I got black, but I haven't gotten mine yet because I order mine off the internet.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.460]   So I backed up a few weeks.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.140]   Yeah, at least.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.140]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.140]   Dwight, Dwight, what did you get?
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.140]   Did you get white?
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.900]   I got the original iPad one, so I had black by default.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.900]   He's got a one.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.820]   I don't feel the need to get one.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.420]   I think it's enough of, I don't think it's enough of an improvement for me to go out
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.620]   and shell $400, $500 and the Chronicle doesn't feel it's enough of an improvement to expense
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.620]   it for me.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.940]   So I'll just, I'll just watch for everybody else.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.940]   I'm kind of with you.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.940]   I think there should be any stress for people who have iPad ones that they didn't get.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.940]   No, it's great.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.660]   In fact, I did a--
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.660]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.660]   Thank you.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.660]   Right.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:50.060]   I did a review of for this Tuesday's Dead Tree edition, which by the way, we now hold
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.700]   our columnists out for a day off the web before they go on.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.060]   So that's kind of like the beginning of a paywall.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.060]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.660]   And I did a review of GarageBand for iPad, which is an incredible piece of software.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.020]   And I went to the Apple store and played around with it on there to see if there was
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.180]   any difference.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.580]   And when I was done playing with the iPad 2, I wanted one even less because I just felt
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.540]   like it really didn't do that much for me.
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.220]   I have an iPhone 4, and so far I want to do FaceTime.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.220]   I can do that.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.460]   Nick, what were you saying there?
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.780]   I think it's a game changer.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.780]   I really do.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.180]   And there's a lot of Apple things I don't like.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.780]   I despise Apple TV.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.620]   I have some problems with the MacBooks and things like that.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.100]   But I really do think that it's a game changer.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.700]   And I think the game changer is sure it's thinner and it's lighter.
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.060]   And it's got the cameras.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.060]   And it's much faster, which was one of the big complaints.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.380]   But I think that the smart cover changes the way I entirely use this thing.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.340]   Hey, I'm not-- I'm totally with you, man.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.340]   I was-- I was a dryer.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.340]   I wasn't going to get one.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.620]   And I've been playing with my brother-in-law's here in his smart cover.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.020]   And I'm like, I want this.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.820]   This is, for whatever, stupid reason.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.940]   Everything about the smart cover makes this more usable in a lot of ways.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.460]   You know what?
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.420]   Tom Merritt, who does our Tech News Today show, has been posting pictures of the smart cover
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.060]   like on his refrigerator, on his water heater.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.180]   Dude, just wait until-- we always get these leaks of third-party cases.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.140]   And they've got dimensions out of Foxconn or whatever.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.380]   And they make these cases early.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.940]   They didn't know about the magnets, right?
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.460]   Dude.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.220]   This first wave of cases doesn't mean it's--
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.940]   Doesn't even do with this technology.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.060]   The second wave of cases for this thing is going to be bonkers.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.180]   I can tell you, I've been hearing.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.940]   I've been reading.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.620]   The case manufacturers are super crazy excited about going after these magnets.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.820]   Yeah, there's so much they can do.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.660]   You know, the way they can build cases, the way they can make cases go on and off the thing.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.660]   They have a lot of ideas.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.620]   Apple, the smart cover is just-- that's like the first thing you do with magnets.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.940]   Like you stick it on there and you close it.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.260]   Case makers are going to be crazy.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.460]   The keyboard cases for this thing, I think, are going to be great.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.220]   It's like--
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:06.260]   In our chat room, me, Claudia, says, it's like Apple invented the magnet.
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.500]   Well, you know in a lot--
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.220]   Refrigerator door, right?
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.260]   It's like the-- you know, you used to have to clip and lock them.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.820]   And you know, and you never knew if the light was on.
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.980]   And now you just open it.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.580]   And I wrote a piece last week about how I timed myself using the iPad 1.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.060]   And you open the screen and you press a little button in the right hand corner.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.340]   And you swipe your finger.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.700]   And it's about five seconds to do that.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.100]   And sure, five seconds is nothing.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.940]   But in the age that we live in today where we're utterly impatient about everything,
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.700]   it adds up to about six, seven minutes a week.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.980]   And the whole thing with the smart case is it just-- it takes that pressure away from,
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.140]   like, do I really want to open it and go through that little process?
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.060]   Right.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.260]   To hold it from ballgame.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.140]   So you're saying I should take the passcode off because that's just slowing it down.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.140]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.140]   Yeah, I'm not getting the full benefit by it.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.740]   I'm getting the full 5.1 second effect, you know.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.180]   Damn, I guess I'll take this off.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.820]   Boy, that's a great tip.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.500]   Right there, that makes it worth listening to the whole show.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.940]   Thank you so much.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.940]   Now I'm going to be trying to steal your iPad everywhere you go.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.940]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.500]   Now I know I can get into it.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.500]   It's actually the big story of the week has nothing to do with Apple.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.540]   Whoa!
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.820]   What did that happen?
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.820]   Sunday.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.700]   You don't usually hear Sunday announcements from tech companies.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.380]   I guess it's not uncommon in Europe.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:26.540]   That's why AT&T announced that it was purchasing Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile USA for $39 billion,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.620]   billion with a B. And the press release immediately started spinning for the benefit of the FTC
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.900]   and the FCC so that they could get this by regulation by saying, oh, oh, by the way,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:42.220]   45 million Americans will now get 4G networks, 95% coverage.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.260]   This is the Obama plan in action.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.260]   Is it?
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.260]   No.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.700]   That's like, that's pandering to the Obama plan to get regulatory approval in action.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.700]   Absolutely.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.900]   They say we're bringing broadband to rural America by buying T-Mobile.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.020]   Yeah, we just thought in rural America at all.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.380]   Like, you just have to hope there's a lot of eye rolling at the FCC.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.740]   Well, it was so obvious.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.540]   It was like, yeah, I mean, immediately they started.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.540]   This is good.
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.540]   This is good.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.540]   No, don't worry.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.540]   Now, here's the question.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.540]   I'm getting so tired.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.620]   I'm going to do my Devorak imitation early.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.900]   I'm getting so tired of these companies merging and saying, this is good for the consumer.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.980]   This is nonsense.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.020]   You don't take away choice and end up making it good for the consumer.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.020]   That's just absolute BS.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.540]   And it makes me matter every time I see it.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.780]   It's like when AT&T and what was singular merged.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.780]   Right.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.260]   I promise like more bars.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.940]   I never saw an additional bar on my phone because it's a murder.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.100]   He'll make you want to go to a bar.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.100]   I did.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.540]   Hey, Neil, I never asked you white or black iPad 2.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.940]   I'm going to get white.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.940]   I had a black one.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.820]   I think the white one's pretty stylish.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.820]   I was feeling my fiance is going to get black so we'll have two.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.820]   So there you go.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.820]   Wow.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.540]   Actually, if you did, if you are a two iPad 2 household, it's good to get different colors.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.620]   Although, you know, now the cases make it, it doesn't matter.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.180]   I haven't decided what color case I'm going to get.
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.180]   I'm leaning red.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.660]   I think white with the red case.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.660]   It's amazing.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.660]   It's amazing.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.660]   This is like a real whole conversation that we're having.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.660]   It doesn't matter, right?
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.660]   It's like a bunch of many bits of ice.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.660]   It's like 15 years ago or whatever, you know, when all the colors came out whole spectrum.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.220]   Everyone was like, what color should I get them?
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.220]   It's this big decision.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.220]   What color?
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.220]   What color?
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.220]   What color?
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.220]   You look like a white red iPad.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.220]   I'm like, Kevin.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.220]   Of course he did.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.380]   I'm going, I'm going all black with the iPad 2.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.180]   Oh, very, very stylish.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.740]   I'm just, I think the profit margin built into this is, I see.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.820]   I actually have different color cases for different outfits that I switch out on it.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.820]   Oh my God.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.220]   Does anyone have a leather?
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.020]   You're so fashion-forward, Nick.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.060]   This is leather.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.100]   It's identical to vinyl.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.740]   Tell me, can you tell?
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.740]   No.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.740]   No.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.740]   It looks extreme.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.740]   I want a friend.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.740]   I can tell.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.740]   You know what the difference is?
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.740]   The difference?
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.740]   $40.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.740]   That's the difference.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.740]   Clear in mind.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.740]   Clear.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.340]   Clear would take even less time off of the magic because then you just wouldn't even have
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.900]   to take the cover off at all.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.060]   The plastic looks cheap.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.740]   It looks like the plastic you used to see on shades lounges in the '60s.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:28.300]   I think, I think, really is right that what you're going to see, this is a proof of concept
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:34.100]   in the other cases that you'll get from folks who can protect both the back and the front
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.100]   much better.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.100]   Right.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.860]   I know as a smart cover loves it and they also complain about how the back of this thing
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.860]   is already scratched.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.860]   Minus, too.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.620]   It's such an obvious place for a case manufacturer to go.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:54.700]   I think there's a sheer number of crazy ideas around magnets that we're going to see.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.700]   That's what you said.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.660]   It's like Apple and Bens of the Magnet.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.660]   They didn't.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.980]   But they're the only company that really goes crazy with magnets in this way.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.620]   The MagSafe connector on the MacBook continues to lead the industry in terms of how do I
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.620]   plug this thing in?
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.860]   And it's just crazy that they know if their company is like, "I'm going to make a prediction."
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.860]   I'm going to make a prediction.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.860]   Alright, Kim Rose.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.980]   MacBook Cares are going to have the same kind of thing happen.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.180]   Yeah, screw Thunderbolt, we got magnets.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.180]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.820]   You know, I just want to point out that probably the biggest story in technology, the AT&T buys
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.580]   T-Mobile story has once again been buried flooded by the tsunami of the iPad cover.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.580]   Wow.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.580]   You went with tsunami.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.580]   I know.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.580]   That's too soon?
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.580]   Too soon.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.580]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.580]   Any magnets?
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.580]   Do you see the I fix it?
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.580]   Tear down to that?
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.580]   Yeah, 31.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.580]   31.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.580]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.580]   31.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.580]   I didn't mean to short-tribbed the magnets.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.140]   It's a lot of magnets.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.140]   It's crazy.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.140]   I think we should probably talk about AT&T.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.860]   I think it's probably bigger news than the smart.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.020]   No, it's a lot of magnets.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:02.940]   I think we're going to see an insane clown posse song to go with one of the Apple.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.940]   If you get the Air.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.940]   Dude, the smart cover blew ICP's mind.
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.180]   You have to imagine that they're like, "Man, these struggles don't know what to do."
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.180]   There's 31 total.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.460]   There's 20 in the cover and 11 in the iPad.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.460]   The literal net has corrected you.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.460]   Got it.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.460]   Well, 31 in the...
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.540]   There's 31 total, but you don't imply that there's 31 in the cover itself.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.940]   This is why I hit the point.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.940]   I can make a difference.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:34.940]   You apparently have a smoking crack again.
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.340]   With the AT&T thing.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.940]   Yes, thank you, Nick Bilton.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.740]   I'm going to share it back on course, even though I was the one that pulled us off course.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.140]   I think a big part of this is the 4G network.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.540]   It's all about the data.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.740]   It's not even necessarily about the subscribers.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.740]   They don't even mention telephony in the press release.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.340]   It's all the first thing in the Q&A is about 4G.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:05.740]   I mean, that's the trying to be ready for Verizon and the 4G network and this is one way to do it.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.740]   But I don't think they're wrong.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.740]   I don't think people care that much about telephony.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.340]   Well, the telephony services on both networks run over the same bands.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:19.740]   If you unlock an iPhone and you put a T-Mobile in it, the telephone works and edge data works,
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.340]   because those are the same bands.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:27.740]   I think the big piece for AT&T and T-Mobile is that they're going to roll out 4G across far more spectrum.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.340]   And T-Mobile does actually own AWS spectrum across the entire country,
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.740]   which is I think where that rural America piece comes in.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.540]   Because AT&T kind of, it owns a huge chunk of spectrum for 4G,
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.740]   but it doesn't have quite the footprint that T-Mobile does in that AWS band.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.540]   And I think that's really the acquisition for AT&T.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.340]   I think they don't care about the technology.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.940]   They don't care about T-Mobile's version of HSPA+ which they brand as 4G.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.140]   I think this is almost a spectrum acquisition for AT&T.
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.940]   And they get all the other stuff for free.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.540]   Well, that's my question.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.940]   You know, a T-Mobile has not been able to go to 4G.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.540]   They've only been able to do HSPA+.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.540]   It looked like they were at the end of the line with L.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.540]   They couldn't get to LTE.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:19.940]   So how in any way does acquiring these T-Mobile towers help roll out LTE to AT&T customers?
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.740]   Is there a benefit?
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.940]   I guess they got rights of way.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.540]   They could build new rights of way.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.940]   That's been a particularly in places where
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.940]   you know, where they have been restrictive in terms of putting up cell towers.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.140]   You know, T-Mobile may have some in places where AT&T doesn't advise first.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.540]   It gives the ability to put that LTE up there.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.540]   The other thing is, is if AT&T wants to do LTE so bad,
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.340]   why haven't they gotten on the stick?
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.540]   Why do they have to acquire T-Mobile before they get after it?
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:56.740]   And anybody who's tried the HSPA+ that AT&T is starting to offer as 4G knows that it's a joke,
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:03.140]   T-Mobile's can get up to, I've got up to about 15 or 16 meg down on T-Mobile.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.140]   On T-Mobile.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.140]   Yeah, but that's because nobody uses T-Mobile.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.140]   It's because you're the only one on that cell tower.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:15.140]   Yeah, but you know, 15 or 16 is half of what you get on Verizon LTE, right?
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.140]   Again, because nobody's using it.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.140]   Well, sure, but I mean, I'm...
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.140]   Well, sure, but as soon as it's one...
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.340]   I'm saying nobody's using T-Mobile to max out of 15 and nobody's using Verizon, it's 30.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.140]   I mean, I'm going to pick the one where when people are using it, it's more headroom.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.140]   You think it'll be faster.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.140]   Okay.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.140]   I think in the end it'll be faster.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.940]   I mean, I think it's not constrained by the technology.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.740]   I think it's constrained by the amount of bandwidth brought to each cell tower.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.740]   I think...
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.740]   No, that's a big piece.
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.940]   And I think T-Mobile has been traditionally ahead of doing the backhaul for their towers.
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.940]   The backhaul is the whole thing, right?
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.940]   Right.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.940]   AT&T has a huge network.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.940]   So putting backhaul to every tower AT&T has has been a challenge for them, especially
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.340]   when a challenge for them in places like New York and San Francisco, where the towers
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.700]   are hidden within infrastructure and really getting the backhaul to the building or whatever
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.940]   the tower is and it's hard.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.340]   I'm going to miss my free tethering.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.940]   I mean, T-Mobile has a lot of nice...
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.940]   Because they're the...
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.620]   You know, also ran, they're more competitive.
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.700]   I think they're cheaper.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.140]   They're definitely cheaper, right?
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.540]   But you know, for the longest time, I think everyone assumed that sprint and T-Mobile would
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.540]   find each other.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.940]   They've been dancing around each other for a long time.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.460]   I'm curious how this AT&T and T-Mobile will come in together.
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.460]   How that's actually going to affect sprint.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.460]   Well, don't you think Verizon now buys or attempts to buy sprint?
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.460]   Maybe.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.820]   You know, I think sprint has a big opportunity to become that low cost, you know, highly
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.740]   competitive, highly differentiated carrier that offers more services faster.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.980]   And that's how I would go if I was sprint.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.820]   I don't know that I want to just merge my way into Verizon.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.340]   It's found its way in sort of recent years, right?
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.340]   The Deivo.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.340]   They're leading with 4G.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:59.780]   Well, I think what sprint has done is where it would make sense for Verizon is that sprint
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.980]   has really kind of pushed the little my-fis that, you know, they were the leader in that
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.980]   for a long time.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.460]   But the other thing they've done that a lot of people don't know about is they've developed
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.580]   partnerships with people for essentially what the web of things will become, right?
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.340]   And so they're creating sim chips and things like that that go into devices that are not
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.860]   even cell phones or tablets and things like that.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.940]   And I think that's a big part of what their business is going to be in the future.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.540]   So it would make sense for Verizon to go down that route.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.780]   Maybe though, that's a tough regulatory decision.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.820]   Maybe that's one of the reasons that AT&T and T-Mobile wanted to get this consummated because
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.380]   if you're first and you get now, there's three carriers, it's a lot harder to go from
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.780]   three to two than four to three, right, from a regulatory point of view.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.340]   They take the first step, right?
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.300]   They essentially get the easy pass.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.300]   They preempt.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.100]   It'll be a lot harder going the other way.
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.340]   The other thing to keep in mind about Sprint is that they're right now using Y-Backs as
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.540]   their 4G and there are lots of rumblings about them moving to LTE.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.180]   It's got to all be LTE.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.180]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.180]   Right.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:05.140]   And in the long term, LTE will carry voice as well as data.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:11.740]   So eventually you're going to lose the current way of doing voice and it'll all be voice
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.980]   over IP and it'll be on LTE and everybody will have that.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.300]   So it'll be a single standard regardless of the mergers.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.580]   Now the chat was going crazy at me because I said T-Mobile doesn't have 4G.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.660]   T-Mobile says it has 4G.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.860]   They advertise 4G but there's some debate over whether they're HSPA plus implementation
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.860]   at core.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.860]   No, T-Mobile began lying.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.860]   This is a lie.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.860]   It's a lie.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.860]   Very simply.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.620]   They began lying and they prompted AT&T to start lying as well and they prompted carriers
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.060]   in Europe to start lying as well.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.660]   I mean, you know, 4G doesn't have a meaning in other words.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.660]   Is that true?
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.660]   Right.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.580]   And the ICU let them kind of get away with it, right?
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.540]   You have to say 4G is a set of technologies that enables these speeds.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.300]   You can't say it's just these speeds.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.300]   You know, and there's some amount of interplay between, well, the consumer just sees the
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.820]   speed so we can call it 4G but I think it's a lot to do with the headroom with how the
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.900]   data is being transferred.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.020]   It's not just we made HSPA fast fast.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:10.300]   And you know, Dwight, to your point, I think you're right, you know, in Leo TU as well.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:14.100]   It has to be LTE, you know, and there's sort of, there are a lot of rumblings about how
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.500]   this might be anti-consumer, you know, and especially I think if Verizon, by Sprint, there's
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.300]   going to be a lot to talk about whether or not removing two players to market, two major
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.140]   players to the market is bad for the consumer.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.500]   I think there's a flip side.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.460]   You know, I'm not totally convinced of this but I see the argument that if you have two
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:36.540]   huge players that are using the same standard and you think about access as a utility and
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:41.940]   now we're competing on the same utility and phones, LTE phones can go from carrier to
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.940]   carrier if they support the right bands, that might actually be good for the consumer.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.900]   It's been an advantage in Europe where they do have GSM.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.540]   It's kind of a standard and you can buy a GSM unlocked phone and you can move around
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.540]   from carrier to carrier.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.540]   That's been a lot more carriers.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.820]   There's a lot more carriers in Europe.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.820]   There's more competition there.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.220]   But the assumption there is that the innovation, the important innovation is happening at the
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.220]   handset level.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.260]   It's happening at the software level, the apps level, and it's not happening in the service
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.260]   level.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.740]   And that's a big assumption but I think you could argue that that's the reality.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.860]   The access is a service.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.180]   That layer is pretty standardized.
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.780]   We want it to stay standardized.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.220]   We don't want to rate the real innovation, the real effects of competition should happen
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.580]   to the handset, the device, the apps level.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.580]   You could make the argument.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.340]   I'm not 100% convinced of it but I see it.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.740]   No, I think that makes sense.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:37.620]   I think it also, when you have a single standard, you do seem more innovation.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:43.620]   I was talking earlier today about the PC marketplace took off because you had a wind tell standard
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.980]   that everybody could write to and that was very powerful.
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.980]   That's very strong.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.100]   I think that that's not a bad idea.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.380]   It simplifies it for consumers.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:56.820]   They have one choice technology-wise and now they can look at service, support, innovation,
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.820]   and coverage.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.380]   I just have a question.
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.380]   How many magnets do they have?
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.380]   You!
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.740]   It's your fault, Nick Milton.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.900]   This is a fascinating story.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.260]   One more question for you all and then we want to move to another story.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.420]   Kevin Rose, will they get regulatory approval?
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:19.260]   Kevin's sitting on the mute button.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.980]   We can't hear you.
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.420]   Kevin, I don't hear you.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.420]   Are you muting?
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.420]   There's no mute button on that thing.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.420]   There we go.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.420]   There we go.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.420]   Thanks.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.260]   I didn't even know Skype had mute.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.260]   It's best.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.260]   Amazing!
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.740]   So, yeah, I think they will.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.780]   I mean, for me, I don't really care about all this.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.860]   I'm going to jump to Verizon.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.860]   I'm going to sit back.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.860]   I'm going to watch it all unfold.
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.020]   I'm going to enjoy actually making phone calls.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.580]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.140]   And, you know, just, I'm happy.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.780]   I'm happy I don't drop calls anymore.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.060]   That's all I care about.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.660]   And I'll jump around and buy whatever little MyFi device is the fastest.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.340]   Could be Sprint, could be whoever comes out with the latest one.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.900]   And that's all I'm doing.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.380]   Dwight, will they get regulatory approval?
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.380]   I think they will.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.820]   And I say that, sadly and cynically.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.620]   I'd like to see the FCC and the Fed's man up and say, no, this is not good for consumers.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.820]   And we're not going to let you do it.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.820]   You agree?
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.820]   Neelan?
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.060]   You know, I think they will.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.900]   But I think the way the FCC is going to man up here, this is a huge opportunity for the
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.900]   FCC.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.140]   You used the phrase "man up" the words "man up" and FCC in the same sentence?
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   I do.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.780]   Because I think this FCC is, you know, they were shell shocked by what happened in their
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.780]   reactions to net neutrality.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.820]   But I think they're committed to it.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.260]   And this is their opportunity to say, you can do this, but here are the conditions for
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.220]   wireless access that we're going to let happen.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.780]   And this is their opportunity to do it.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.060]   I hope they seize it.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.060]   Maybe I'm just being an optimist.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:48.260]   But I hope they seize that opportunity to say, yeah, we'll give you regulatory approval.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.940]   But the conditions for that approval involve some really strict net neutrality conditions.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:53.940]   That's interesting.
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.940]   Do you agree, Nick?
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.940]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.780]   I mean, I think maybe it's going to be a little tough and there'll be some drama and
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.940]   the press about it and about whether they'll get approval.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.580]   But I think that they eventually will.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.300]   But the FCC really has an opportunity here.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.740]   You know, they've been really trying to get accessibility for people that can't afford
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.140]   these high prices for data and phone calls and cell devices and things like that.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.580]   And with this, if they approve it, they have the opportunity to say, hey, look, we'll let
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.100]   this go through as long as you do X, Y, and Z.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.780]   There's another strong argument.
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.300]   I think it reminds me of SiriusXM, which really was a crazy merger because then that
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.300]   was only one.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.780]   But they had to do it because they would have both gone under.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.300]   And I think you're going to have the same problem with Sprint.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.860]   I think T-Mobile is just not viable by itself.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:42.500]   You've got two big strong companies, AT&T and Verizon, and the rest are also rans.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:48.900]   Nick made an interesting point about extending services to lower income folks.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:56.900]   There's actually an FCC related success story with that with AT&T and DSL, where AT&T required
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.660]   as the, I forget which merger it was, but where AT&T required as a result of a merger
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:07.940]   that the FCC required that AT&T use, offer $10 DSL.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.780]   And they did so for a long, long time.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.100]   It got a lot of people onto broadband who had not previously been on broadband.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.740]   And then, of course, once that period was over, they started jacking the price up again.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.740]   But it brought people online and made the network more valuable.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.900]   And so I think that the FCC does have an opportunity here.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.380]   If they end up approving it, I like what Nick says.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.380]   So, opportunity.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.140]   And not for me, it's weird for me to bring up AOL.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.660]   But when AOL and Time Warner merged, the same thing happened.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:41.140]   They put all these restrictions over how both companies could offer access and specifically
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.140]   broadband.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.020]   There's a lot of precedent here for the FCC to say, here are the conditions of a merger.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.020]   Right.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.020]   Let's hope so.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.020]   Let's hope they man up.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.020]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.860]   We are talking with a prestigious panel.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.860]   I don't think you can get more prestigious.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.500]   Kevin Rose, Dwight Silverman, Eli Patel, formerly of Engadget and Nick Bilton of the New York
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.500]   Times.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.380]   I got to ask, Eli and Kevin, what's next for them?
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.220]   And we've got some questions for you guys.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.300]   So prepare your answers before we do that, though.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.780]   I would very much like to talk about our friends at Citrix, folks who do a product.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:18.260]   They're the kind of the kings of remote access, but they do a product for support, folks,
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.820]   that is just stellar.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.700]   I want you to try it for free for the next 30 days.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.340]   It's called go to assist express.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.700]   Kevin, I think we used this on the screensavers many moons ago.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.700]   We were trying.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:37.980]   We were hoping we could fix people's computers on the show remotely.
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.700]   It just never really took off, but that's, again, we were a little early.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.980]   We were the first to use netcams too on the show.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.500]   Yeah, people are still on dial-up back there.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.660]   It wasn't really easy to do, was it?
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.660]   Now you can do amazing things thanks to high-speed internet.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.500]   Go to assist express means.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.300]   Even if your client or your customer doesn't or your mom or dad doesn't have it installed,
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.700]   you just send them a link.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.140]   It's a very quick install for them, easy too.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.420]   They don't have to know anything.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.420]   And boom, you're in.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:08.700]   The net traversal and things make it so it's very trivial for this to work.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.660]   It is 128-bit SSL, completely secure.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:16.540]   It has a lot of features designed for the support professionals, such as the ability to do eight
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.140]   sessions at once.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.980]   You might say, "Well, why do I need to do that?"
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.700]   Well, you start installing one machine, a scan and another machine, and you can see why
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.060]   you might want to move around.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.180]   It also will tell you exactly what software is running on the machine, including operating
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.580]   system and security software.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.020]   You can drag and drop fixes from your computer to the other.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.340]   You can even show, I'm not sure how useful this is, but I think there's times when you
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.740]   might want to use this, you can show your client what your machine looks like.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.220]   And say, "This is supposed to look like this."
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.460]   You can, so it's really very flexible.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.980]   Cross-platform to Mac or PC.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.260]   Go to assist with just name the worldwide market leader in remote support by Frost and
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.380]   Sullivan there, an analyst group that specializes in this.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.820]   And now you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:04.380]   Go to assist.com/twit, G-O-T-O, assist.com/twit.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.380]   Try it for 30 days.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.340]   They have day passes, a very affordable monthly fee, but you've got it for free for 30 days.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.020]   I think you could probably find some uses for it.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.980]   And we thank Citrix, they're great people for their support.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.780]   They just announced their iPad app for Go to My PC, which is just awesome.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.140]   Go to assist.com/twit.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.620]   Wow.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.620]   Kevin Rose.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:28.100]   I just went real quick, Leo.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.780]   My colleagues at the Times, Andrew R. Sorkin from DealBook, he just posted a story that I
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.260]   just saw about the AT&T deal.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.580]   And they were saying that the Dutch telecom, which owns C-Mobile, is so worried that the
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:46.180]   deal won't be approved, that they require that AT&T pay a $3 billion breakup fee if
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.580]   the thing doesn't go through or something like that.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.580]   Wow.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.580]   That's a scoop.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.020]   So we're all speculating where it'll happen.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.380]   And it looks like it is going to be a bit of a struggle, but they wouldn't have gone
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.260]   through it if they didn't think it was going to.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.460]   Well, I would think sometimes you might have somebody to say, "Well, we don't know, but
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.460]   let's try."
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.460]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.740]   I mean, that's happened before behind the scenes.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.700]   And things have stopped right before they went through the gate.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.500]   So it's possible.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.820]   Kevin knows a little bit about that.
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.420]   So Kevin, what happened?
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.580]   Did you actually resign?
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.900]   Resilient is a strong word.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:29.540]   Basically what happened is, you know, I've won the new CEO joint dig about six months
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.540]   ago.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   Matt Williams.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:37.700]   He took over duties in the day-day operations of everything going on at the HQ.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:43.700]   And basically, my role was more of a kind of board member advisor to him.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.860]   We'd get together for weekly lunches, things like that.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.980]   So really what the news is is more just me starting something new and not really leaving
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.820]   dig because I've kind of been out for a while.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.700]   You haven't been that part of the day-to-day anyway.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.980]   It's been a while since I've been really data-involved.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:06.820]   So the Techcrunch story that announced this also says you are closing a $1 million plus
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.100]   financing around for a new startup.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.860]   Care to confirm or deny?
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.300]   I will have something to announce in a few weeks.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.700]   You've always been so cagey.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.700]   Can you give us an idea of what category?
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.860]   You're going to stay with news?
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.860]   No, no.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:27.740]   It will be nothing even close to it's going to be consumer-based stuff.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.820]   Just tell me you're not starting a netcast network.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.340]   I am not starting a netcast network.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   That's all I ask, Kevin.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.340]   I'm not doing any more podcasts.
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:41.660]   I'm staying and doing dignity in this other one foundation than I do.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.620]   I've got some ideas I want to try in the mobile space.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.100]   So we're going to do some mobile stuff.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.940]   Kevin, I have a question.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.100]   You were the founder of Dig.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.740]   It's been how long now?
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.740]   How many years?
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.820]   Six and a half years.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.780]   How many years?
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.860]   How do you founded it?
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.500]   I know you've wanted to sell several times and things haven't happened.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:11.740]   How do you feel personally about what happened and having to leave of your own accord, of
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.060]   course, but how do you feel about on a personal level, not a business level, about what the
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.060]   end product is and so on?
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.980]   I think that a few months ago, it felt really bad just backing out because there was a lot
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:27.380]   of really bad stuff going on the site with the user revolts and the servers batching.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.380]   The Dig for transition?
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.180]   Yeah, after Dig for came out and it was clear that we, everything from all the issues we
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:39.700]   had technically to some of the bad product decisions that were made, it was a bad time
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.700]   to leave.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.100]   So traffic has been actually not bad.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.180]   It's been up over the last couple of months.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.260]   In almost, I don't know, they're going to actually, I think we'll be talking about that
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.260]   soon.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.060]   Dave will be talking about that soon.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.620]   So it's, you know, Dig's making double digits of millions of dollars per year in revenue.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.540]   We still do about 20 million monthly unique visitors.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.460]   It's the, the tales that being dead are greatly exaggerated.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.900]   I mean, it's, it does an insane amount of traffic.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:14.740]   It's still a top 100 or so web property on the net and traffic has actually started to
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.740]   increase.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.780]   So I don't feel bad about the timing.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.780]   It sucks.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.380]   It's, it's my baby, you know, so I'm always going to feel tied to the product.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.180]   And, you know, as Matt wants to get together and talk about product ideas and everything
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.380]   that he wants to do at the site, I'm more than happy to take those meetings and sit down
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.500]   and figure that stuff out with them.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.220]   You know, for me, six and a half years, I'm just like, I'm burning a little bit.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.980]   So it's going to be nice to have this little break away from that.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.340]   You'll do something else and then hopefully creatively get back into the mode of thinking
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.940]   about social news and being able to help out from an advisory role.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.140]   So I recommend the break.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.140]   The break is pretty good.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.980]   Let me try it myself.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.980]   Another, another quick question.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.980]   What, when you start these new startups that you're about to get funding for, what do you,
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.860]   what lessons will you take from Dig that things went wrong or right that you can apply
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.620]   to these new products?
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:02.900]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:09.140]   The first and foremost is that in the early days of Dig, when we started bringing on employees,
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:14.860]   we were growing so fast from a traffic standpoint that our solution to problems was throwing
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.380]   warm bodies at the problem.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.020]   So, you know, we needed more cutters.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.820]   So we were just bringing cutters as fast as possible, hiring, hiring, hiring.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:24.180]   All of a sudden, you know, I woke up one day and I looked around and there's, you know,
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.100]   20, 30, 40 people around you.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.100]   I don't know these people.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.620]   I didn't interview these people.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.980]   We got in a lot of some BNC grade talent.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:39.380]   You get some BNC grade developers and they bring their C and D grade friends in.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:44.740]   And all of a sudden, you know, you have a big challenge when it comes to getting rid
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.900]   of those people and bringing in new talent.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.940]   And I think Matt's been done a really good job or a new CEO at hiring.
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:57.140]   We probably added, I don't know, maybe 10 or so people in the last six months.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:02.180]   And so just kind of making sure that I'm involved in every aspect of hiring.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.540]   You live or die by the quality of your talent that you bring in.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.700]   So I'm hand picking every single person that I'm working on this project.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.460]   It's going to be extremely small.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.780]   I don't want to raise these insane amounts of capital for this business.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.420]   It's going to be, you know, a team of five, maybe six people.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.820]   And you know, we want to stay nimble and just build some really cool stuff.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:29.980]   And will you be cautious who you decide to take funding from based on things that happen
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.180]   with JEG as far as sales?
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.460]   It didn't go through and things like that.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.740]   No, no, it's funny.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:38.500]   It's like the board, everyone that we worked with at DIG from an investor standpoint has
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.580]   been phenomenal.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.260]   I have had no problems with our investors.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.380]   In fact, I would gladly take money from them and get in the future if I ever need it.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.700]   They're a little bit bigger kind of tier investors.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.940]   They're more venture capitalist style.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.580]   You know, the round of financing that I'm raising now is going to be very simple, just,
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.540]   you know, a bridge slash convertible note.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.540]   Really easy terms.
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.860]   It's like three pieces of paperwork that you need to sign.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.820]   Mostly all from friends and angels.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.460]   So big chunks of it from friends and angels.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:09.900]   And then a couple bigger, super angel kind of small tier VCs.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:15.780]   So you know, it's, if I need bigger, more capital in the future, which I don't know that
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.780]   I necessarily will, I might need a little smaller chunk.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.420]   But if I do, then I'm going to go after, I'll probably be working with the same people I
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.420]   worked with at DIG.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.420]   They've been great partners.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.340]   Great luck was one, right?
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.860]   Great luck was awesome.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.060]   Highland Capital, another awesome one.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:36.100]   You know, those guys at Great Luck, David Z, who's on the Facebook board and he's been
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:41.540]   on our board for six years, he's been a great partner and just a sage just in the corner
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.860]   helping us, helping us out.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.860]   So yeah.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.340]   Well, you know, you're still doing dignity.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.660]   We know that you're going to continue with that show.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.660]   Yes.
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.980]   Thanks for forcing me to crowd surf this week, by the way.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.980]   That was awesome.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:00.100]   I was like watching you crowd surf because it's always kind of scary.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.100]   Part of me is like, oh, they're going to kill Leo.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.100]   And that's part of me.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.340]   They came really close to dropping me, dude.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.220]   You know, my mistake was when I first of all, there were six of us.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:14.780]   Was you me, Alex, Lisa Bettany joined us, Brian Rushwood, Prager.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   And they were distracted.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.780]   Right.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.780]   They came real close to dropping me because they're all going, I don't want to be holding
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.780]   Leo.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.780]   So.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   Well, and part of it is that, you know, you have two types of geeks that are out there.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.700]   You got geeks that have some, you know, some few week wings.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.700]   And there's a lot of keyboard geeks.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.180]   They get a little worried they might drop you.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.940]   If you're going to crowd surf, don't crowd surf geeks is your.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.020]   No, it was fun.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.580]   You've done that before, right?
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.180]   I mean, the only two times are with you.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.180]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.180]   Oh, man.
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.980]   And you're going to stay on the board or you'll be an advisor.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.700]   What will your role be?
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   Advisor slash board members.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.940]   So just really getting in there and helping Matt out with product stuff and then just coming
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.060]   in for those monthly board meetings and helping out there.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   But again, the good news is there's a lot of tech French take as dead posts.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.340]   It has a ton of cash in the bank, like millions and millions of dollars and a ton of traffic
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.620]   and actually traffic that's finally ticking back up and seeing some growth again.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.700]   So I'm optimistic about their future.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.980]   I think that they've finally got a really good team that can scale and iterate fast.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.980]   So we'll see.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.980]   We'll see what happens.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.100]   I think actually this is a pretty good time.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:31.540]   It's on a good, look, there was trouble with Dig 4, but it's a solid company.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.740]   And I think you did what you did what you like to do, which you created it.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.740]   You started it.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.740]   You got it going.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.940]   You got it through some rough times, which I'm sure were difficult personally for you.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:46.020]   But you've got a company that's far from dead, as you point out.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.700]   That's alive and working and succeeding.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.420]   And it's a good time to leave, I think.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.180]   I think it's a long question.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   And I think about a lot.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:59.340]   With Dig, there was a lot of the big strength of Dig was the users directed so much of it.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.620]   And I think that a lot of problems, Dig 4, was that you took away some of that control
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.780]   from the users.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.300]   You gave it to more site managers even to third party publications with RSS and stuff
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.300]   like that.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.700]   It's a great project.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.180]   Which way are you going to go?
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.180]   You're going to go totally users?
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.260]   Are you going to be curated?
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.260]   What's kind of your experience?
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.020]   Screw the users, boy, do they?
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.020]   It's just easy.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:23.180]   Because I don't really think that this new project really works like that.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.780]   But it's all consumers using it.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.180]   It's nothing that has to do with curation.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.180]   Well, it's hard to explain.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.180]   It's different.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.700]   I don't need any editors or anything like that.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.620]   It's something completely different than Dig.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.620]   I guess, big one.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.500]   Is it top down or is it bottom up?
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.740]   It is bottom up.
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.900]   I think that the tricky thing with Dig, and this is the biggest mistake.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:54.580]   One of the big mistakes that I made with Dig before, I think, one of the things that
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:59.260]   when we look at Dig as, this is the hard thing about taking venture capital as well.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.420]   When you take a look at how Big Dig eventually grew to become, at our peak we were doing about
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.900]   38 million monthly uniques per month.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.380]   So right now we're at about 20.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:13.540]   When you look at the peer group of who we were in and all the other similar sites at
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.020]   a route on that scale, that's the CNNs of the world, the MSNBCs, everybody else.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.020]   We were a big news site.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.140]   I don't know what the New York Times does.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.220]   You guys doing niques wise?
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.380]   I don't know what the latest numbers are.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.380]   2030 maybe.
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.380]   It's the same ballpark.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.380]   It's the same ballpark.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:39.900]   So one of the things that was discussed a lot within the company was how can we get out
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:46.420]   of this kind of cats jumping off of diving boards, news, and more into mainstream news.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.700]   The belief was that if you get into more mainstream news, we can actually get people
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.020]   voting on things that are just more serious topics.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.620]   One, it looks better for the company, the evaluation, the company and all that.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.700]   The other thing is that we could be a hard hitting news site and we could eventually
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:04.940]   continue to grow and get to that 50, 60, 75 million uniques and be this breakout successful
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.780]   social news site.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:13.500]   The lot of the features that were designed in V4 were with the publishers in mind.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.340]   How can we get their content in the system easier?
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.380]   Well, it's automatically imported via RSS and put one dig on it.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.980]   How can we get more mainstream news on the front page?
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.460]   Well, let's suggest users that are mainstream media.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.420]   We're really trying to play to mainstream media.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:31.420]   No one paid us to be on that list.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.620]   Users don't want them.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.140]   When they look at this, they say, "This is where I go to kill 10 or 15 minutes of my
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.740]   day when I'm done reading CNN or I'm done reading those traditional news sites and I
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.980]   want to just go see the fun stuff."
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.260]   We never embraced that.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.260]   I don't think.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.860]   We never embraced how really we were about that.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.580]   That was our culture.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.060]   I think that was kind of a mistake that we made.
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.780]   There's pressure from all different types of people at the company to kind of go in that
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:02.860]   direction and I bought into it and said yes to a lot of things I probably shouldn't have.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.620]   It's cool to see Dig now going back to that original thing, saying like screw RSS, we're
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.940]   getting rid of it.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.820]   The design, everything, the functionality is more aligned with what it once was, which
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.220]   I think is a good direction for them.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:21.500]   I think the other thing that is fascinating with Dig, and I still use it on a regular basis,
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:26.820]   but one of the things I found fascinating covering it and also knowing Kevin early on
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:34.500]   is that it's an interesting sociological look at when the users control the system and when
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.500]   they don't.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.500]   You can see that there's times that Facebook has had to relent, right?
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.700]   It was some of the privacy things and things like that and this times that they haven't.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.580]   There's times that Twitter has had to say, "Okay, we're going to change this and this
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:49.060]   times right now especially where there's no way we're doing what we want."
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.980]   I think it was really fascinating to watch how the users revolted in some respects and
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.740]   sometimes accepted things.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.140]   I think that that's been a really interesting part of the whole social aspect of what Dig
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.140]   is.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.380]   There's also a huge amount of snobbery of people who don't like it when the users say
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.180]   how it's...
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.820]   What's wrong with cats and toilets?
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.820]   That's what people want.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:16.460]   Well, even from a publication standpoint, we always race to get and get the stories on
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.580]   the Dig first and to sort of get the dig.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.580]   Very powerful.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.580]   We're tech news.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:27.020]   There's a sort of the new iPhone and a cat and a toilet in a lot of people's minds.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.020]   It's pretty much equal.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.860]   They live right next to each other on the internet.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.500]   When they roll out the RSS tools, when you guys did all that, we're like, "Oh, this
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.460]   makes it so much easier for us."
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.780]   People will just find it.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:44.420]   What actually happened was that everybody's iPhone story hit Dig and without the user-curated
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.140]   aspect of, "This is the one I like.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.140]   Here's why.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.740]   I like to talk about it."
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.940]   We saw our dig traffic kind of like no-stive after this.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.140]   That hurt us also because a couple things.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.620]   One, it hurt us with Google SEO.
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:03.100]   We lost a lot of traffic from the SEO juice of those original titles because those users
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.900]   were oftentimes going in there and typing in their original title versus what you guys
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.900]   had put in there.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.660]   If Google looks at two pages that are identical, it sees the Engadget Post and it sees the
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.660]   Dig Post.
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660]   They both have the exact same title.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.020]   It doesn't care about the Dig Post.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.620]   It's going to go straight to the source.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.060]   When Dig had a lot of this original content in the titles and descriptions, that was actually
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:25.860]   really good for Dig and drove us a lot of traffic from natural SEO.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.860]   We missed out there as well.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.780]   That was kind of an interesting thing.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:34.540]   I'm not trying to sound prescient or anything, but when Dig made it shift, there was a lot
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.620]   of excitement at places like the Houston Chronicle because we thought, "Oh, it would be easier
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.700]   to get our stuff into the stream."
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.980]   I went and started to build a Houston Chronicle area.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.060]   I watched what was happening.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:54.700]   There's just going to be a flood of this publisher content and we're going to get even more lost.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   I didn't continue it.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:01.420]   I didn't put our Rs. feet in there because I thought that's not the way to do it.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:06.060]   The way to do it, Kevin, as you mentioned, is to do it with something that's unique and
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.100]   speaks to the Dig audience as opposed to something that's automated, so we did not do
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.100]   that.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:17.620]   I don't know that necessarily that helped us in the long run with stories, but what I
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:23.500]   saw early on is what happened to Dig and I'm glad I stepped back.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.100]   It shows what a challenge it is to do this.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.100]   It's hard.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.100]   It's very nice.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.900]   There's new stuff in London.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.700]   I want to ask you, Nili, about you leaving.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.900]   It's only fair.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.100]   We've grilled Kevin.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.580]   All right.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.580]   What happened?
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:48.500]   Look, at the baseline level is AOL paid me really well for four years to do whatever
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.540]   I wanted with almost zero interruption.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.740]   I'm not going to...
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.500]   It was great working there and gadget's great.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.100]   I still have a lot of friends in gadget.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.340]   I trained a bunch of those guys.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.340]   They're really great guys.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:03.020]   They're going to work really hard and gadget will be successful.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:07.940]   But AOL as a company is going through a really big project right now to be perfectly honest.
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.100]   Is it the AOL way that bothered you?
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.980]   No, no, no, no, none of that.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:12.980]   Look, none of that.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:13.980]   Absolutely not.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.620]   None of that stuff is ever going to touch and gadget.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.780]   None of that ever touched me.
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:21.220]   When I say they'd never told me what to do, they never ever told me what to do.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.220]   That was smart.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.220]   That was smart.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.820]   Well, you know, I'm smart and all of my decisions are perfect.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.820]   Smart of Tim Armstrong not to do that.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.060]   Well, we had an engager team and Josh was my boss and all this stuff.
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.980]   But I think Ariana is going to be great for AOL.
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:40.300]   She's brought more energy and ideas and people respect her.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.860]   She's inspiring people there.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.620]   She's cleaning house.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:45.740]   She's got a lot of ideas.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.900]   She's in charge.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.900]   She's doing it.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.980]   It's kind of like what's the next step for me?
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.460]   Do I want to be aligned with AOL and their projects and their goals?
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.860]   It's not that I think they're bad goals or a bad project.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.980]   It's just kind of like I want to be Ariana Huffington.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:10.620]   I want to be in control.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.740]   But now you and Joshua resigned at the same time.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.900]   Was it a joint effort or was your coincidence?
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.460]   No, well, so the deal was I would be the next editor in chief.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.940]   So Josh resigned before me.
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:26.060]   And then when I moved to New York to the managing editor, that was part of the agreement.
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.620]   And so then it was on me to be the editor in chief.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.060]   And I took a weekend.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.060]   It was a really hard weekend.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.020]   And turning down the job of editor in chief is not easy.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.500]   It's the dream job for Igeek, I think.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.020]   And I said, no, Josh is great.
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.620]   He's been a friend and mentor for a long time before that Ryan and Peter.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.260]   Really great guys, really smart guys.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.740]   I never thought I would do them.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.100]   My ideas are better about how to run a gadget site.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.500]   I always thought, well, I can probably do that.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.060]   I can probably get to where they were.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:03.300]   But some of the, it's these goals, it's these big, huge bucket goals and AOL's huge strategy
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.300]   shifts.
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:09.620]   And I thought to myself, well, my personal goals, they're not perfectly aligned.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:13.140]   And I need to figure out where to do that that is real.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.260]   So I said, look, I don't want to be the lame duck editor in chief who's looking for an
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.260]   out.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.340]   I want you guys to grow without me.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.340]   So I'm going to say no.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.540]   And that was really hard decision.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.100]   But that's what happened.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:28.580]   It's not, I wasn't like, I pick up a printed out copy of the way and like set it on fire
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:30.020]   and like throw it in some arms.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.020]   And none of that happened.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.020]   It was very clean.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.020]   It's very easy.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:34.020]   I'm still friends with all of them.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.500]   They're still asking me questions and still helping them do whatever they need to do.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.300]   And the next thing, you know, we'll get there.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.300]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.100]   It really strikes me AOL is old media.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.100]   They really are.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.860]   You know, they're the oldest of the new media and a lot of ways.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.620]   And they've, so they become old media and that doesn't fit the new, you as a new media
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:52.620]   type.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.980]   Yeah, you know, they've got a lot, you know, they run a bunch of properties and they do
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:02.540]   a lot of things and they have a lot of relationships with, you know, their other partners.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:06.620]   And, you know, new media is about being super agile and being really fast.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:09.220]   And I want to embrace new ways of doing things.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.620]   And, you know, they want to too.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.860]   But I'm, you know, I want to go and write about what I want to write about and think
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:15.860]   about what I want to think about.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.580]   And I don't want to be worried about what's happening.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.420]   It's this huge company that I work for.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:24.580]   And, you know, some people are really happy with the stability of a large company and
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.420]   they're going to be happy with the stability of AOL.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.420]   And that's great.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   And they should be.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.700]   Me, you know, I like to, I'm interested in seeing what something a little bit leaner
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.700]   is like.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.700]   Very interesting.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.700]   Am I being cagey enough?
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:36.700]   I mean, that's perfect.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:37.700]   You're good.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.500]   And what's one last question?
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.420]   Do you have a plan of place to go or is this somewhere, are you casting around or are you
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.420]   looking for something?
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.300]   You know, right now I'm talking to everyone.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.300]   I've gotten a lot of very flattering job offers.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:52.660]   I think if you're down on yourself, the best thing you can do is quit your job because
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.460]   apparently it boosts your ego.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.620]   Well, that's not too for everyone.
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:02.020]   Well, it's the first time I've ever put my job like this and it's worked wonders.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.340]   So, getting a lot of very interesting offers, listening to a lot of people.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:09.860]   You know, it's weird in the industry is when you're competitive with your peers, you can't
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.540]   have real conversations about tools and workflows and directions for the industry.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.540]   Right.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.540]   You have very cagey.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.260]   Two journalists talking to each other is like two attack dogs.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.260]   Sizing each other up in a lot of ways.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:26.180]   And now I'm getting to have very honest conversations with people about how they think the industry
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.660]   is going, you know, how tech news should work.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:32.900]   Tech news, I think, is a very strange breed just because the relationships seem to have
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:33.900]   the industry.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.300]   Things like, you know, we talked about the Apple Smart Cover for 10 minutes at the top
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.740]   of the show before we talked about AT&T and T-Mobile.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:43.540]   And you've got problems, like sort of structural problems of how do you convince readers that
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.980]   things other than Apple are interesting.
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:45.980]   Right.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:46.980]   And it's kind of a big deal.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:51.140]   You get to have really, I've had some really awesome conversations around that stuff and
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:54.940]   around, you know, what we're going to do and how it's going to work.
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.580]   After that, you know, I think that's going to take a few weeks.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.100]   After that, I think all something more interesting to say.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.100]   Good.
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.660]   Well, thank you for sharing that with us.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.660]   I hope it was not boring.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.740]   Even if it was, thank you for sharing.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:13.340]   We're talking with Kevin Rose, Eli Patel, the new media, the old media, Axis.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.820]   Although I have to say, Nick built in you are, you are a little skunk works within the New
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:22.340]   York Times in the sense that you absolutely are cutting edge within the New York Times.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.340]   So I don't.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:29.820]   But outside, I'm just a, I'm a total loser.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.540]   I wouldn't say that, but don't quit your job.
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.540]   Okay.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.860]   So we're going to take a break.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.060]   Come back with more Dwight Silverman is also here who is always a good friend from the Houston
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.460]   Chronicles tech blog.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.620]   We are talking about the tech news.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:47.620]   I want to talk a little bit about Twitter's decision to, we talked a little bit last week,
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:54.180]   but I think that this is a very interesting change of direction for Twitter to kind of
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:59.540]   tell the third party app developers, "Hey, maybe you don't want to do a client."
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.540]   This is an interesting question for Twitter.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.500]   Strategic, we're going to give them some strategic advice in a moment.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:09.060]   But before we do, I think I'd like to talk a little bit about Squarespace.com, the secret
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.940]   behind exceptional websites.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:16.420]   We use it for our inside Twitter blog, and I'll give you a Squarespace user.
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.420]   And indeed.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.060]   Squarespace.com/
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.540]   I saw the new version, by the way.
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.540]   Have you?
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.540]   Okay.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.820]   They were going to show it to me and I didn't get a chance to see it.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.660]   Can you say anything about it?
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.700]   So Anthony, the CEO, I met up with him.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:33.700]   Honestly, I think Squarespace is one of those things that's like, Anthony is such a brilliant
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:34.700]   product guy.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:39.260]   Like from a UI and UX experience, it's insane.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.100]   But I'm not saying that they paid the nation.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.380]   I don't have to say that now.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.380]   It really is cool.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.300]   You'll see it in a few months.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.300]   But yeah.
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.940]   They've been talking about this for two and a half years.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.940]   You think it's pretty close?
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.740]   I mean, it looked like it was ready to launch and he said, "Oh, I got to...
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:53.740]   He's a perfectionist."
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:54.740]   He looks everything perfect.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.420]   He's like, "Oh, I need like two or three more months.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.660]   I just want to get everything just right."
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.180]   I'm like, "Launch that now, dude.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.180]   It looks awesome."
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.180]   Well, here's a beauty.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.100]   If you are a Squarespace customer, you get it automatically.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.140]   This is the nice thing about Squarespace.
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.180]   You know, once again, I use WordPress on my personal blog.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.300]   I don't know why I should really move over to Squarespace.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.820]   We use it for other business.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:17.940]   But somebody sent me an email and said, "You know, dude, you're running 3.0 of WordPress.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.500]   There's major security flaws.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.500]   You got to update."
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.020]   And I said, "Oh, crap."
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:25.540]   The nice thing about Squarespace, it's hosting plus the software.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.540]   And the updates just come along for the rides.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.900]   You don't even have to think about it.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.940]   By the way, really simple to set up an incredible site.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.060]   You can try it for free right now at squarespace.com/twit.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.780]   Click that green "try it free" button.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:38.780]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:42.700]   Just a site name, password, email address, and this little capture here.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:47.180]   And now for two weeks, you've got full access to all the Squarespace tools, including the
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:51.220]   API importer, removable type WordPress, type pad and blogger.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:54.700]   That means all your comments, your links, everything, your images, they all work.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:55.700]   You can export them too.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:56.700]   So you need to use.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.700]   Oh, it's fantastic.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:58.700]   You got to import your WordPress over.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.700]   You got to convert.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.700]   Yeah, I should.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.700]   Well, I've done it a couple of times, you know.
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:02.860]   And I just can't pull the plug.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.060]   I got to do this.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:07.540]   You know, I look at the iPad app and the iPhone app and think, "Boy, I'd love to moderate
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:08.540]   the comments that way."
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.180]   The integration of social media.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.060]   I mean, you don't, again, you don't have to be a designer here.
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.060]   What they've got is these widgets.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.060]   Like, here's the Flickr widget.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.580]   And it's, you know, sliders and buttons and boom, and you got it.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:22.540]   You can have the thumbnails or you can have the slideshow view.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.700]   A lot of photographers use it because it's so easy.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.500]   There's the Twitter widget.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.700]   Couldn't be easier to add this.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.140]   They got widgets for everything, including a simple RSS widget.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:34.380]   So that means anything with RSS, you can add right to your site.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:38.180]   Now, sure, if you know CSS, you can use CSS in JavaScript.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:42.420]   You're not limited, but it's just so that people who don't, you know, aren't spending
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.660]   their entire life learning how to do web design can get great sites.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:50.420]   And just take a look at the example sites to get a sense of what's possible here.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.420]   Incredible.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:59.860]   Businesses, photographers, artists of all kinds, musicians, bands, podcasts, of course, radio
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.220]   stations.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:06.340]   All you got to do is go to squarespace.com/twit and set up that site, that first site.
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.700]   Create it for yourself.
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:12.080]   If you don't have a website, you've got to, you've got to own your presence on the net.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.180]   If you know somebody who you think should have a site, you could set it up for them and just
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:21.020]   hand them the keys and say, here, starts at 12 bucks a month for hosting, the best hosting
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:24.180]   out there and great software.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.620]   Squarespace.com/twit, we thank you for their support.
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.820]   Can't wait to see version six.
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:29.820]   Very excited.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.020]   I'm jealous you saw it.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.380]   They came up to me and said, you want to see it?
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.380]   I said, how?
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.180]   And I didn't get to see it.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.380]   I'm going to bounce Leo.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.380]   All right.
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.380]   Hey, Kevin Rose, it's been great.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.020]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.620]   Congratulations on your next chapter.
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.260]   I can't wait to find out more about it.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.340]   Sir, Dwight, Nick, Neline, good seeing you guys.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.340]   Good seeing you.
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.340]   Good night.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.860]   KevinRose.com or @KevinRose on Twitter.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.260]   Either way, that works.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:55.260]   Thank you.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:56.260]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.260]   Take care.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:02.940]   A little bit about the Twitter.
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:07.460]   Nick, is it a slap in the face to third party developers for Twitter to say, hey, we're
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.500]   not going to support you guys anymore.
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.300]   You got to start using the--
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:15.940]   You know, I'm going to preface this with that.
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:20.500]   I'm friends with Ryan Sarver, who runs all of this stuff on Twitter.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:24.620]   And I'm not sure if Ryan makes the decisions or if it's other people, I'm sure that it's
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.620]   a big group.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:29.380]   But I do feel like-- and he's an amazing guy, and they do amazing work.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.300]   But I do feel like it's a bit of a slap in the face because if it wasn't for-- when
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:37.700]   I think back to when I first started using Twitter in early 2007, if it wasn't for those
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:41.220]   third party apps, I never would have had the opportunity to use it, right?
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.700]   If it wasn't for all these third party experiences, I could never have used it.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:46.700]   Exactly.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.900]   It's like, dance with the one who brought you.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.980]   And I understand that they want to control the experience and control the ecosystem and
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.980]   all these things.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.180]   Do you want you to see the ads?
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:57:00.620]   And at the same time, they need to find a solution that works for both the goal that
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.900]   they have and the people that brought them to where they are.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:07.220]   Because it's like getting arrived from a hitchhiker and not saying thank you.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:08.220]   It's like--
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:13.660]   You just walk away, get out of the car, and it's like, excuse me?
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.660]   Hello.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:18.980]   I understand both sides of it, but I don't think Twitter is going about it the right
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.340]   way right now by just ignoring everyone and saying if you step on our tour if you're
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.340]   going to have trouble.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:29.820]   Well, in addition, Nick, the Twitter apps aren't all that.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:30.820]   No, they're terrible.
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:31.820]   There's a lot of things.
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.220]   Yeah, there's a lot of things that they don't do.
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:39.100]   If Twitter had the definitive top apps that had all the features that you needed, then
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.100]   it wouldn't.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:46.020]   I was really upset that Twitter removed support for third party URL shorteners because it
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.780]   allowed-- it gives you analytics.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:54.020]   If you have to use their T.CO, you don't have any way to know what's happening to your
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:56.900]   clicks, and that's just really irritating.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:01.900]   That's-- they're making their money on the backs of the data, but they're not sharing
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.740]   that data with the people who are creating the data.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:08.660]   Does anybody surprise that that-- I mean, come on.
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:09.660]   Are you surprised?
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.540]   This is how they've been all along, I think.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:18.540]   Well, I'm not surprised necessarily, but I agree-- it goes back to dance with who brung
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.540]   you.
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.780]   The community has brought them where they are, and the developers have brought them
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.020]   where they are.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:27.620]   And by taking this stance, they're cutting both off.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.180]   I think that's-- I think it's just wrong.
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:35.020]   And I-- to reiterate, I really don't think that they should say, oh, you develop, it's
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:39.380]   going to do whatever they want, and we're going to do whatever we want.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.460]   There's a balance in there.
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:47.220]   And I think that-- to your point, the user interface-- I mean, I was a user interface
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:51.420]   designer for years, and one of the things that drives me bonkers about Twitter is you
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:55.980]   pick up that-- you download their apps on any device, and it's a different UI, and it's
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:59.420]   a different look and feel, and it's utterly confusing when you bounce between them.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:03.380]   And because of that, for example, I use Echo Phone on my phone and on my iPad, right?
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:04.380]   Echo Phone is great.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.380]   Echo Phone is awesome.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.900]   Because it's consistency between the two.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.500]   I don't do it because I prefer Echo Phone over Twitter.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:14.820]   If I put Twitter on my iPad and Twitter on my phone, I'm like, in this world, I don't
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.820]   understand.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:21.400]   And I think that that's one of the big downsides to them saying, if you build app
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.400]   we're not going to support you.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.400]   And we don't have an app for the biggest--
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   We don't have an app for the biggest--
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.880]   That balance that you're finding is-- they could say-- they said, we want to focus on
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:33.860]   our own third party apps because we see all these inconsistent user experiences.
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:38.060]   And we want people to focus on using the right terminology and some other stuff.
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.580]   But they could just enforce that.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.420]   I mean, they write the contract.
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.620]   They write the terms of use.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:47.420]   You could say, to use a Twitter API, you must call a retweet a retweet.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.820]   You must say, you must be able to open images in line.
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.440]   So I'm set of standards.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.040]   And they could approve all the apps.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.040]   That's not what this is.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.960]   It's pretty obvious because of that.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.680]   What this really is, is they want everybody to see the dick bar.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.920]   Yeah, pretty much, right?
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:09.200]   You know what's funny though, Nick, is I thought first stage of Twitter when I'm just
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.640]   like you, I only used it because of the great apps.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.640]   And I used it because of Tweety on the Mac and eventually because of Tweety on the iPhone.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.480]   And those are the apps that they own.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.560]   And it's kind of like, well, is that sort of fine?
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.700]   I mean, I use the apps to use Twitter because Twitter didn't make any apps.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.440]   But if they had it, it might have just been fine.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440]   I might have just used it.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.920]   Well, but that's the point is that when they launched, they didn't have the resources
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   to make the apps.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.600]   They allowed-- that was the success.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.360]   The secret of the success of Twitter was this third party-- the very good third party
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.440]   API and encouraging third parties to piggyback on that.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.760]   If they didn't have the third party API, first of all, I really don't think it would
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.760]   be what it is today.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.760]   Right, right.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.440]   I don't think APIs would be what they are today.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.920]   I think they were at the forefront of-- and it was by chance.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.480]   It was a happy accident that their system didn't work, but the APIs kind of did and
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.320]   people built things on that.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.960]   And I think they need to acknowledge that.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.040]   But the other thing that you just said about maybe they need to create better terminology
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.440]   and things like that, I've been talking about for a long time.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:12.520]   I don't understand why there aren't essentially design guideline APIs.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.960]   If I'm going to build something on Twitter, maybe it's like if you want that app in there,
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.760]   maybe you have to be a little Apple and you say, "Hey, it has to be green and this button
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   has to look like this."
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   Exactly, right?
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.080]   Apple does it across-- it's funny.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:32.560]   Apple does it in orders of magnitude, more apps than Twitter would have to deal with.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.280]   I mean, they figured that out.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.760]   Maybe it doesn't work and obviously everybody has issues with the App Store, but you can't
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.920]   deny that Apple has a system in place for enforcing the apps that come in their store.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.520]   And ironically, even before the App Store, Apple did that.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.600]   I mean, Apple is from day one, the Macintosh had very strict user interface guidelines
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.600]   and people followed them.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.840]   And if you didn't, you weren't Mac-ish.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.000]   But what's interesting about this conversation is not that Apple does it.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   Apple does do it.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.080]   What's interesting is that it's such an obvious rebuttal to what Twitter said when they said,
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.920]   "We're not going to do a third party apps anymore."
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.320]   It's such an obvious rebuttal to that argument that we're seeing too much differentiation.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.840]   We're seeing too much chaos in the ecosystem of third party apps.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.760]   You can just say, "Well, look at the App Store.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.360]   Like, if they're doing it in there and it works, why don't you have a Twitter App Store
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.960]   and why aren't you taking 30% of the revenue for $1 Twitter apps because you've had this
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.640]   process of approval?"
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.560]   And I don't see why that isn't happening.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.840]   And they really haven't addressed this most obvious counter-arguments, what they're saying.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.840]   All right.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.840]   All right. enough to do it.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.360]   The one thing about Twitter is they still don't even have an app for the biggest computing
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.520]   platform of Windows.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.160]   There's no official app.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.560]   In fact, most of the apps for Windows are awful.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:58.800]   And if Twitter were to do what Nelie is saying, you would end up with probably a better Windows
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.800]   app.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   That's a good point.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.480]   You know, I mean, they're right.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.000]   There's your case for it.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.200]   Yeah, but on Windows, all the apps are air, right?
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   I mean, they're bad, but there's a ton of air apps.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.040]   I mean, there's tweet deck on Windows.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040]   That's why I use on Windows.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.120]   I mean, there are apps on Windows.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.480]   It's just that there isn't an official Twitter app.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   And there's no native.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.920]   There are no native apps that are any good.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:26.760]   There's one called MetroTwit that's being developed by Long Zing and a few of his collaborators.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.720]   And that has a lot of potential.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.000]   And there's been some discussion on Twitter about, well, maybe that's the one that Twitter
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.400]   ought to buy.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.400]   And that kind of, you know, seems to be that's how Twitter will handle it is rather than
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.400]   build one of their own.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.600]   They'll buy something like MetroTwit.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.440]   Well, you know, you can always use the website, which I think a lot of people do.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.440]   I think that's really probably what Twitter would like.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.720]   I'm sure most of their monetizing is going to happen on the website, not in apps.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.720]   Let's talk about Microsoft.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.200]   Did you know they're more Google than more Google?
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.400]   They're more ethical.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.840]   They're more ethical than Google, Apple or Facebook.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.760]   According to the, I've never heard of them, F This Fear Institute.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.960]   I love these organizations.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.960]   I love getting the car.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.960]   What the hell is this?
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.240]   You can't even say it.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   The as the.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.840]   It's like, you know how I supply just appeared out of the blue, like it's like out of room
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.840]   many years ago.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.840]   Just because they're awesome.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.840]   Yes.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:21.840]   They are awesome.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.840]   They pretty much just appeared by putting a PR about how much they guessed.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.840]   I fix it too.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.840]   Well, but I fix actually.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840]   They do something.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.840]   Right.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.720]   But I suppose we guessed the screen costs $18.37 and it's like everybody publishes it.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.800]   This is like the same thing.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800]   It's like this.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.160]   We guess we guess Microsoft's more ethical.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.240]   It's a great name.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.240]   The S.F.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.520]   Fear Institute definitely sounds like it should be in the next buyer's fear game.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.240]   They they have 3000 companies on the on the list.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.720]   Google not even on the list.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.080]   Apple not maybe they just didn't test them.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.120]   Apple and Facebook not on the list.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.560]   It's based they say on factors like history of regulatory infractions.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.160]   Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.040]   More than 3000 companies applied to be on the list.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.800]   Oh, Google just never applied.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   Oh, you have to apply.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   Apple apply.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   Apple and Facebook.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:13.800]   I just never do you think Steve Jobs is like guys, we got to get on the atmosphere list.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.560]   And you know the atmosphere people asked for 10 grand to be rated, right?
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.640]   It's like who's who?
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.800]   Maybe this maybe well that would be ethical.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.840]   I don't think so actually.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.080]   Maybe the atmosphere folks.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.920]   Yeah, they shouldn't be on their list.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:34.200]   Adobe Cisco eBay Salesforce and Symantec and Zappos are on the list of Amazon, which
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.440]   don't Zappos is not on the list.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.440]   In fact, why am I even reporting this story?
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.800]   I apologize.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   I retract.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   I just like the headline.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   I just like the headline.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   Yeah, I know.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   It's a great headline.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.240]   That's why they put out the PR.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.960]   That's called SEO baby.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.400]   IE9 is out.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.480]   Dwight, you reviewed it and mentioned by the way that it's not for Windows XP.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:09.120]   Yeah, what's interesting with IE9 is that according to the net market, the net applications survey
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:15.760]   from last month, 55% of people are still using Windows XP.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.400]   That means and IE9 will not run on it.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:26.040]   That means that Microsoft is basically saying we're giving up for IE9, 55% of current users.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.440]   Do you think is there a technical reason why it couldn't run an XP?
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:37.200]   Microsoft has said that it's because of certain technologies that are in Vista and in Windows
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.640]   7, particularly involving hardware acceleration and the way it works.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:50.320]   But at the same time, Firefox runs on Windows XP and it has its own hardware acceleration
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.200]   and so does Chrome, although Chrome is a little bit further behind in those two.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.440]   So Microsoft could do it and simply disable it, but I think what they're trying to do
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.800]   is this is part of Microsoft's push.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:08.400]   Just one more thing to make Windows XP users feel a little bit less than they should.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.120]   Just one more thing is a registered trademark of Apple Computer and...
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.200]   No, I mean, look, this is like the best decision Microsoft has ever made.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.200]   I agree.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.280]   I think it's the right decision.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.280]   It's the right decision.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:24.680]   You've seen the IE6 countdown page, haven't you?
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   Right.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.680]   From Microsoft.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:33.880]   I just think if Microsoft being trapped, they've been so trapped by XP for so long and
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.400]   everything that they've done.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.240]   They've been carrying the burden of Windows XP with them.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.480]   And you know, hardware makers too.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.560]   You can buy new computers that run Windows XP.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.560]   That is insanity.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.560]   Right.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.720]   You really shouldn't be able to.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.720]   Really?
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720]   Can you...
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.720]   Today you could buy a computer with Windows XP on it?
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.560]   I'm pretty sure you can call Delaware Lenovo and be like, "I'm an enterprise customer
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.120]   and I really need XP laptop and they'll send you one."
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.120]   Right?
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.120]   That's bonkers.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.600]   I mean, if Microsoft wants to push itself forward and stop being the company that sells
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.480]   Windows XP, they have to just stop being the company that sells Windows XP.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:14.640]   And you know, Dwight, to say Firefox runs on anything at this point, I think is a different
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.840]   concept of running in the broad sense.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.760]   I mean, I dread every single time I click on the Firefox on the iPhone.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   Really?
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.760]   I can't.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   Have you tried before?
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.760]   It's very slow.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   It's really...
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   It's really...
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760]   It's...
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.760]   It just...
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760]   You know, Firefox is the new IE.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.760]   I think that's what we've come to.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.760]   It's...
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.760]   I think there's a browser...
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.760]   There's a browser circle of life and everything slowly becomes Internet Explorer.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   And we've seen the rebirth of IE and now Firefox is taking its place.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:46.000]   I mean, I hope they take some radical steps that may result in improving what's happening.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.400]   I think 4 is supposed to be a lot faster.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.400]   Everybody likes 4.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.400]   I thought 4.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.400]   You know...
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.400]   There's a lot of some early demos of it a couple of weeks ago.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.080]   And some of the HTML5 stuff is pretty mind-boggling that they can do.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.400]   They show me some games where...
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:05.320]   I mean, I just thought it was a flash game or something like that that was actually working
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.960]   properly.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.480]   And they've really done some impressive stuff with the HTML5 stuff.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.600]   So I think it's going to be helpful because it's going to help drive people to build more
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:20.280]   web-based HTML5 apps, which is a good thing for the ecosystems that have evolved over
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.040]   the past couple of years for the iPad and so on.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:27.920]   So you know, and it may be a little bit slow, but I do see a lot of positives with it too.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:34.680]   This is the HTML5 Planetarium, which I'm by the way, rendering in Chrome.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.960]   But that's the point of HTML5, is it not?
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.440]   That it's a standard.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.440]   Yep.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   So...
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.800]   Although, as I understand it, if you run some of the IE9 demos that are HTML5 demos and
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:53.080]   you try to run them in something other than IE9, they don't necessarily run as well from
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.080]   one eye.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080]   Interesting.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.080]   I've not.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.200]   Well, and then each company has its own benchmarks.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.240]   You know, Opera created the acid benchmark, making sure that Opera is the only one that
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.480]   could get 100% on that.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.920]   There is a Firefox created bed.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.360]   And they all do best in their own benchmarks.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.360]   So it's very confusing.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.240]   For consumers, it's confusing, but I don't think consumers are really looking at benchmarks
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.240]   or anything else.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.240]   They're looking to see...
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.680]   I think that was a big browser switch every like three years, right?
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.200]   They get tired of IE's who switched to Firefox.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.080]   I've been trying to get my fiance to switch to Chrome, but she knows Firefox.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.960]   And one day I'll get her to switch to Chrome.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.920]   And then there'll be enough inertia that I'll have to get her to switch to IE like three
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   years from then.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.800]   You know, I think that's how consumers do it.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.960]   Do all smart people use Chrome?
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.280]   That seems to be the case.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:41.400]   Or on a map, I think there's a lot of natural inclination used Safari.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.640]   Not after Pwn to Own.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.640]   You saw that, right?
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.640]   Five seconds.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:50.440]   And every year Safari is like a regular thing.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.440]   But Apple put out patches right before Pwn to Own.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.240]   Two big sets of Safari patches.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.920]   One of them they labeled an iTunes patch.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.240]   But if you looked at it, it was all Safari, right?
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.560]   And their WebKit patches.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.760]   And still they got hacked.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:10.320]   Meanwhile, Google puts up 20,000 additional bucks in addition to the $15,000 prize for
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.760]   somebody to hack Chrome and nobody even tries.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.760]   I think that's pretty good.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760]   I didn't see that nobody tried.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.360]   I'm not reading news like nobody.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360]   Nobody tried.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.360]   Yeah, you don't need to.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.360]   In fact, I apologize, Eli, for bringing you out of your coma.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.360]   I've been I've been doing nothing but getting extremely drunk and passing out and crisis.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.560]   I drank something last time called juice J O O S E. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.560]   no, it wasn't good.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.560]   Don't drink anything.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.160]   Spell J O O S E. That's a bad sign.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.160]   Juice, man.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.920]   And I tweeted a picture of it and somebody immediately replied, I see unemployment.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.160]   It's been good to you.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.720]   So where do you get juice?
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.040]   See, I suddenly just added I wasn't I wasn't out there looking for it.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.720]   I assure you I was not seeking juice.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:56.120]   Juice was provided to me and just found you given my lack of current responsibilities.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.600]   I took the plunge.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.600]   I think J O O S E is actually pronounced Jews.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.040]   God, why do you have this picture?
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   You just brought it up.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.040]   It's made of people.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.080]   That's me drinking juice.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]   It's for Purim.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.880]   I mean, that's for Jews for Purim.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.640]   You were drinking a special Purim drink.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.120]   It makes me want to put a hat on and dance around.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   You know, one more Firefox thing.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:26.680]   I think one of the reasons why Firefox remains so popular despite, yeah, it has some performance
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.560]   issues is the is the plug in and extensibility of it.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.560]   I know people.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:36.720]   But that's why it's slow because you got running 800 extensions.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.720]   Right.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.000]   It's a double edged sword.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   People kind of loaded up.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   I need all these extensions.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   I need all these extensions.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.920]   And why is this so slow?
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.320]   What a surprise.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:50.040]   One of the cool things about IE 9 is it will when you first launch it, it tells you you're
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.480]   running all these things and it's slowing you down.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.720]   If you turn them off, the browser will run faster.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.760]   That's a great idea.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.160]   That's a great idea.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160]   Just tell people stop.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160]   Just stop.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.040]   I have a bunch of extensions in Chrome and they don't seem to be taking nearly the tolls
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040]   my extension.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.040]   No, I do too.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.720]   Although I was funny because just before the show and the people are watching the live
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.080]   stream on the show saw me do this, I went to my website and there was a little bird next
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.200]   to my name, a little Twitter and I hovered over it.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.080]   And you know how I hate these ads where they open up when you accidentally move your mind
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.680]   and a whole Twitter thing open up.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.640]   I mean, what the hell is this?
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.040]   And apparently I don't even remember doing it.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.720]   I had installed some Chrome extension that was doing that.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.440]   So I had to go through all my extensions.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:36.560]   By the way, if anybody ever doubts that a new lie is a bad ass, just look at his Twitter
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.560]   picture.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.760]   I love that picture.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.120]   That's such a great picture.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   I'm scared.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.000]   Man, that go T was a victim of being engaged.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.960]   This man is an attorney, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960]   He's hired.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.240]   I want him to work for me.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:00.880]   Every time I shave, I'd shave that go T and I walk out of the bathroom and I'd look
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.400]   at Becky and I'm like, huh?
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.400]   And she's like, uh-uh.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.800]   Then I go back and throw it back.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.200]   Throw it back.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.880]   So IE9 2.3 million downloads in the first 24 hours.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.080]   Now it's not being pushed.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.720]   This is people who opened IE8 and saw the banner that says, one nine and clicked it.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.720]   That's, you know, Microsoft is like dig.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.720]   People say it's dead, but they still have huge amounts of power in the marketplace.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.360]   Look at the Xbox news last week.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.720]   Yeah, 10 million connects and 10 million games, right?
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.600]   I mean, that's crazy talk.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.560]   Brad, more than the iPhone, the iPad.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.520]   I love that too, because you know, Apple is growing and you know, the fastest consumer
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.920]   selling device, best consumer device in Microsoft, like a week later is like, yeah, check it.
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:50.880]   Although it could be a semantics issue because the people in the chat room said connect is
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.280]   not a consumer electronics device.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.280]   It's an accessory.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.280]   Wow.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.600]   That is you are some pedantic, literal nantic chatters.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.120]   You are really living up to that IRC stereotype.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.760]   Noodle nats.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.760]   Will Microsoft kill the zoom?
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.760]   Absolutely.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.760]   Why not?
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.760]   They have to.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.760]   And will anyone notice?
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.120]   I think they've got it.
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.480]   You know, they've got, they're going to have to, I mean, they've integrated that software
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.600]   into Windows Phone 7 and if they, they want to do follow the line that Apple went, which
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.360]   was a success, this is a successful one.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:30.240]   They have to, you know, where Apple really pushed the iPhone software about the iPod.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.800]   It was the one of the three things they mentioned when they first showed the iPhone.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   They have to do the same thing.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.880]   They have to say, you know, don't buy a zoom by a Windows Phone 7.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.800]   But why not make a zoom three, I guess it would be, if it is an iPod touch competitor?
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.800]   Why not?
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.800]   Or why not?
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.800]   That's true.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:46.800]   The zoom was so close.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.000]   If they put apps out and all that, they were so close.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   No, I mean, it's a great point.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.720]   I think they, you know, they need to do that or hurry up and get the Windows Phone 7 user
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.200]   interface into the tablet market because I think that could be a really amazing competitor
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.200]   to the iPad.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.000]   I completely agree with you.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.600]   You know, the thing with the zoom, I keep on saying this.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:10.680]   I feel like everybody in the world has signed up for RDO in the past month.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:15.240]   Everybody I know, a lot of people I don't know who are now following some stuff on me.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:22.040]   And it's like, Microsoft had this opportunity and I find it just fascinating that they squandered
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.040]   it.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.080]   I mean, that's what zoom and zoom pass were in a real way.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   And they were really great.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.680]   And I remember so many people I knew with Macs or iPods or whatever who couldn't get
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.160]   zoom pass saying, man, that's so great.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.160]   And now they can get it.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.160]   They can get it through RDO.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.160]   Get it through MOG.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.920]   Mostly with RDO, I've noticed.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   But I think people really responded to the social component.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.720]   Do you like RDO?
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:44.720]   I do.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.720]   I love it.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.920]   I've been, you know, my next gig is apparently RDO evangelist because that's all I'm doing
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.360]   with my time right now.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.360]   But you really, really work.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360]   Aren't you?
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.360]   I'm showing you.
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.360]   I'm asking.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.360]   I'm Pat Hanson.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   Give me the job.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360]   That's bad news.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.640]   No, everybody I show it, you know, they really respond to it.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.320]   And I, you know, it's easy.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.320]   It's so easy.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.320]   Five bucks a month.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.320]   Five bucks a month.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.320]   It runs on BlackBerry iOS, Windows Phone 7.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.320]   Right.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.440]   And the thing for me, Nick, maybe you're in the same place.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.800]   I have so many devices.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.880]   I have Android devices and iOS devices and like 30 laptops.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.120]   I can just make it all work using this one unit service.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.120]   It's device agnostic.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.280]   And I feel like that's what Microsoft needs to be doing.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.320]   They need to be saying, zoom is our unifying music service.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.360]   And we're a software company and we're going to make software that like puts this all
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.360]   together.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.320]   And that's a huge opportunity for them.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.400]   And they just blew it completely.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.200]   And our audio is just stepping to that space.
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.840]   And you know, I don't know if you can compete like really well with the many players in
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.840]   that space right now.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:51.360]   No, I see the same thing with, like I'm the same way I have gotten us how many laptops
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:55.160]   and I have computers at work and at home and in my car and, you know, under the bed.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:58.080]   And I have my iPads and kindles and everything.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.960]   But you know, just for software, for example, I drop boxes become, you know, the thing for
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.960]   me.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.960]   Right.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.320]   And it's done and that's it.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.320]   And I don't have to worry about that.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.080]   And you know, all these companies could have built those things, but they just, you know,
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.080]   they flaked on it.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.920]   But I think Microsoft, they wanted to do, they wanted to make zoom.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.960]   They wanted to make zoom, build their platform.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   It's actually pronounced Zeus.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.960]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.360]   It's always been a terrible name.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.960]   You know, they, they sacrificed the zoom's potential, you know, at the altar of their
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.000]   platform and the promise of platform was never good enough to pull it off.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   Right.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   Well, they also, they also were obsessed with Apple and they wanted, they did it because
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.040]   they wanted to kind of bump off Apple and do, you know, one of their slow creeps into
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.640]   somebody else's market like they're trying to do with Bing.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:54.600]   And they didn't have, you know, they, they started off stupidly with, with ugly, ugly
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.280]   hardware and really, really bad decisions in terms of the way.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.440]   It's a Brown's work.
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.200]   It's, you know, I mean, that wording ridiculous.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.200]   Yeah, that was good.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.920]   And but the zoom HD was a really nice device.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.080]   The one software was really good.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080]   Great screen.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   Who's that in the background?
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.200]   You got to, you know, Niele, Niele, is there a party going on at your house?
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   You want to?
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.200]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   I'm sure you're right.

[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.200]   I'm sure you're right.

[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:48.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:49.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:51.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.200]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:59.200]   I'll tell my quick little bits.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:03.200]   As I say, a university is a Montessori school because you go, yeah, you have to learn certain things, but then you go and find the things you're interested in and focus on that.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.200]   So the university is Montessori as well.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:09.200]   I definitely tried to find as many girls as possible when I was at university.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.200]   Well, that's a kind of works of a kind.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.200]   No, so you write about Google in that sense.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:20.200]   So the Google TV was a 20% project, right?
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.200]   Maybe it shouldn't have been elevated.
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.200]   Still is.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.200]   It still kind of is.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.200]   Actually, it should be a 10% project now.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.200]   I think there's, I've heard some rumblings that are in the market.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.200]   They're in the planning phase of big relaunch.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:38.200]   But that was like a 20% project that grew into a real project for the company.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.200]   And that's like pretty great.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.200]   Normal companies don't have a pathway for that.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:48.200]   And then Android, you know, the Android team is in a tiny little building and they probably
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.200]   need more space.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.200]   And from what I've heard Andy Rubin doesn't want to give people more space.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.200]   He wants it to feel like a cloistered startup that has to scrap for success.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.200]   And that's one of the ways that he preserves that atmosphere.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.200]   I think that's cool.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.200]   I think that's the sort of stuff Larry should focus on.
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.200]   Steve Jobs did with the Mac team, right?
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:09.200]   Right.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.880]   And they're on their own and you say you guys are in charge of your destiny and you've got
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.880]   to succeed.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.800]   And if you fail, everything about this goes away.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.320]   Not you work at this huge office building.
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.120]   And if you fail, you know, you still.
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.120]   We're the safety net.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.120]   Right.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.120]   So I think that stuff is maybe what Larry should focus on.
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.600]   Not more, not these.
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.520]   We can just do whatever we want because we're a new company.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.080]   The other thing that I think that they should focus on, you know, they're really going for
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.080]   social and I have a little anecdotal story.
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.000]   A couple of years ago, I was a little bit fed up at the times and I was looking at other
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.680]   places to work.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.520]   And I spoke to some execs at Google and, you know, there was a job that I was really interested
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.920]   in and we were about to start this like application process and one of them said, well, do you
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.200]   have a degree?
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.080]   And I said, no.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.920]   And they said, well, I don't think you'll be able to get a job here.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:38:59.920]   Wow.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.360]   And I said, well, would Mark Zuckerberg be able to get a job here?
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.280]   And they were like, hmm.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.680]   And I said, would Bill Gates be able to?
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:09.880]   Like, and went through a list of people that I know that don't have degrees.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:14.520]   And they said, we have a system here and an algorithm that we follow and a degree and
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.040]   these other things are a big part of that.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:21.520]   And what I, and I could have pushed and, you know, and tried to like go for this job.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.120]   But I sat there and I thought to myself, how can these people figure out social if all
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.840]   they have within this organization or the people that are the top tier of the educational
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:36.360]   base and don't necessarily have social experiences in the same way that people that are using
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360]   these services do?
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.000]   And I think that that's a big reason why this company really is having such a hard time
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.560]   figuring out the social aspect of the web.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.560]   Hmm.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.560]   Very interesting.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.240]   Well, I can't wait to read the books.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.640]   It's built for geeks.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:50.640]   That's the geeks with the degree.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.960]   That's the bottom line, right?
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.480]   I mean, I don't have a degree either.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:59.200]   I guess like I'm going to have to throw out my dream of working at Google.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.640]   Some day will all work for Google.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.080]   Oh, we do all ready to like that's the beauty of their business model.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.960]   We're all working for Google.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:11.080]   Facebook is going to start putting a major league baseball on its site.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:13.280]   Now the first movie is now Major League Baseball.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:20.680]   According to Peter Kafka writing for all things D. Major League Baseball's page has streaming
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.680]   games.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.240]   Very interesting.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.520]   What's Facebook up to here?
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:27.440]   Is this a global strategy or just?
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.080]   They're going for the real question is what is what is baseball to?
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:34.080]   Well, baseball is just going to go anywhere they can, right?
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.240]   I think what everyone is going to do is go where they can, right?
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:41.320]   I mean, I think what Facebook is up to is I teach a course at NYU.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.760]   It's called 1-2-10, right?
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:47.560]   And it's about designing interfaces for the 1-foot mobile phone, 2-foot computer and
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.160]   10-foot television experience.
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.240]   And Facebook is not in the 10-foot experience yet.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:54.240]   And I think that they know that's the next frontier for the web.
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.400]   People are cutting their cable and all these things.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.240]   And they want to be available in that spot.
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.440]   And that's why they're going for streaming and Netflix and all of it.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:05.360]   They're doing instant, they did movies a few weeks ago, right?
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.480]   They think they had the dark nights streaming on Facebook.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.480]   Right.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.480]   Right.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:13.960]   But the flip side of this is if you look at baseball has suddenly started putting its
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.880]   content everywhere it can.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.080]   I think it's quite smart.
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.360]   It's made it extremely accessible and extremely friendly.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:24.800]   And I think that what they're really trying to do is they have, there's this perception
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.760]   that baseball is the old stuffy sport.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.360]   And most of the people I know they like baseball because they can drink a bunch of baseball
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.920]   games and they don't really watch baseball.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.280]   It's a bunch of farm boys with shovel handles.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.280]   Exactly.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.040]   It's a pastoral game.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:42.080]   It is not 21st century by any means.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:44.800]   Yeah, the NFL is like a high tech.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.800]   Right.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.800]   Like it's warm in the way.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.800]   And the way.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.800]   Right.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:51.880]   And I think it's cool that baseball is like we have to be out there.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:55.440]   We have to put our product in front of people to make them like it.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.520]   We can't just be stuck.
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:01.320]   I like this because the clip that's on the Facebook page was apparently testing.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.960]   It's clip three we just watched.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:11.120]   There what they're doing at MLB is essentially this is a come on to get you to go and use
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.200]   their premium service.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:15.080]   I think they put a game a day on there.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.080]   That's smart.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.080]   And I bought the iPad.
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.080]   I bought the iPad.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:19.800]   They have an iPad Android and iPhone app.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.480]   And of course I have the iPad app because you're going to watch games on it.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.040]   And have you noticed that each year that app gets more and more expensive?
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.040]   Sure.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.040]   Why not?
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.520]   It's gone up like I think it's like doubled almost every year.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.560]   It's gotten it's quite there's going to be a football strike.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.280]   We got to watch something.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.280]   Right.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.120]   It's going to be a football strike.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.120]   Oh yeah.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.160]   They liked other players.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.760]   I'm not a I'm not a big sports guy.
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.760]   Sorry.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:47.800]   Really you look like you might have played football in Montessori school.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:53.400]   No football Montessori school as you get to run around the field doing works.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.880]   You enjoy.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.600]   I don't care for the football.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:00.200]   I'd like to go kick that flower.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:07.200]   So I think we should we should end on a sad note and maybe talk about Japan and the and
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.120]   how it's going to affect the business of electrons.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.320]   Let's wrap it up because I think of course and I talked about this last week.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.160]   It's pretty hard to talk about technology news.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.680]   It really isn't that important when it comes to things like an earthquake tsunami in thousands
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680]   dead in Japan.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.960]   However, Japan does produce quite a bit of the electronics that we use.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.640]   Not so much the devices.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:33.600]   This device the iPads made in China, but the NAND flash inside of it is made in Japan.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.760]   And many of those factories were in the Sendai area.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:40.880]   I, you know, it's funny as a technology reporter who works next.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:46.000]   I work right next to guys that are reporting on what's going on in Japan and the environmental
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.760]   desk and so on.
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:50.840]   And I some and I was writing about, you know, the line at the Apple store the other day.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.640]   And I sat there and I was like, what am I doing?
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.800]   And I realized that it's important for me to, for us to talk about this stuff because,
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:04.080]   you know, those NAND flash drives are going to pay for some kids health insurance in Japan.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.120]   And they're going to put food on the table for somebody else out there, you know, and
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:11.000]   I think that that's why it's, it is still important to talk about this stuff as a global
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.120]   economic discussion.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:19.080]   I think it's also important to note that how fragile the technology we rely on is, you
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:22.600]   know, we, we have hurricanes down here in the Gulf Coast all the time.
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:23.680]   Our power goes out.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.840]   We have, you know, we lose all of our creature comforts.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:32.360]   And every time that happens, I think this is just like eggshell thin.
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:36.360]   And you see the same thing happen in Japan is that it's, this is kind of a little taste
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:43.280]   of, of just how easy it would be for us to go back to, you know, a very much more basic
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.280]   way of living.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:50.640]   Nick, you know, I think that New York Times photo with, you know, it was a slideshow with
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.240]   the slider that showed you before and after satellite.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:54.240]   Oh, that's amazing.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.240]   Amazing.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:56.240]   Amazing.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:00.480]   And I think that actually in its way was the most successful piece of reporting out
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:05.200]   of Japan because you don't, you know, facts and figures are one thing, but people actually
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:12.880]   seeing how easily things can just be literally wiped off the map.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.120]   More people I know have like donated and tried to help them in their own little ways because
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.880]   there's not that, that any story, that's actually, you know, the time, you know, you talk about
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:25.800]   the time to do all like that sort of stuff I would always do.
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:30.480]   That's what Bill Geller is arguing that, you know, the paywall is there to make sure
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.840]   these things exist and without it, they won't.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:37.800]   And, you know, there was, there was two other things I tweeted this week on Nick Hilton on
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:38.800]   Twitter.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:44.200]   And one was the graphic that they did the Times did about explaining how a reactor explodes
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.400]   and what happens and how you pull out was fascinating.
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:51.440]   And then there was another one that was in Week in Review this week, which was a story
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.840]   about lessons from Chernobyl that Japan can learn and explaining just how the sarcophagus
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:02.360]   has been built around the Chernobyl atomic disaster and how it's still just as bad as
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:05.120]   it was when it happened decades ago.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.480]   And, you know, I think there's been some, they've done some amazing reporting.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.480]   It really has been fantastic.
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:12.720]   And I have to commend them and I'm sure you're involved in this.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.840]   They've really made the interactive, the online side amazing.
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:20.680]   I mean, it is, and this is what you need to do if you're going to survive, I think.
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:21.680]   It's critical.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.760]   And I think people will pay for that.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.760]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.840]   No, I don't think anybody's going to pay for the daily on the iPad.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.320]   Has anybody seen a link to the daily?
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.800]   I mean, I haven't.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.800]   Nobody sent me one.
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:35.800]   No.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:36.800]   I got this news in the daily.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.800]   No, they don't link out.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.800]   You can't.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.800]   No, you can't.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.040]   But there's a way to share and I don't see anybody sharing their links.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.040]   Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.640]   So you, what is, what is it?
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.720]   I mean, I tried the daily brief and it's like, I'm sorry, I'm not going to pay for this.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.280]   So what is there is, can you send email a link?
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.380]   Is that what you do?
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:53.800]   You can post it to Twitter.
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:54.800]   You can email it.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.800]   And you fax it.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.560]   You fax it.
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.480]   You can print it out and give it to your neighbor.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.960]   But if you click that link in Twitter, what do I get?
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:04.960]   You get it.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.960]   You tweet it out.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:06.960]   You put in your Twitter credentials.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.560]   Yeah, but what, but I can't get back in, right?
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.560]   It's painful.
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:15.440]   It doesn't open the app, but there's an HTML page for every story.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:18.200]   Oh, and it doesn't link to any other stories though.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.200]   Right.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:21.200]   It's a very awesome thing.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.540]   You also can't share every story.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:26.440]   Some of them when you go to share them, it says this story can't be shared.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:29.560]   You know what I mean.
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:34.200]   So I think to the Daily's credit, I do really like the voice.
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:37.200]   You know, they have a lot of young reporters and they have fun and like, and they crack
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.360]   jokes and you actually get that in there and they explain things.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:45.920]   And in a really unique way that it's not stuffy like the times of the journal.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:50.280]   And it's, I think it reaches an audience that wants news that is news, but is not too
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.640]   stuffy.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.600]   But I think that you're going to see the same thing that's happened with, for example,
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:57.440]   the iPhone 18T, eventually it's going to be everywhere.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:01.600]   The Daily will only be on the iPad for a certain amount of time and then you're going to start
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.640]   to see it on every other device.
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:04.640]   Really?
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.360]   But the hook for that is the news has to be good enough to drive you to the device.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:12.360]   And I haven't seen that yet.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:17.000]   And I think that's, I don't know if that relationship, that incentive structure will
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.440]   ever actually work.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:23.560]   Because you know, it's the news and the news is this happened and you can find out that
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.240]   this happened like anywhere.
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.440]   Almost all of it is commodity.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:31.320]   It's, you know, very little of it is compelling and Nick, you know, some of the stuff I've
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.960]   seen in there has just been embarrassing.
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:42.320]   They did something on a dating service that puts a heart monitor on you and it tests how
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:46.680]   when you're meeting somebody at your date, how you react to the things they say.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.560]   And it was just embarrassingly bad.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.760]   And that's the kind of thing I see in there all the time.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:56.920]   I'm not sure that, you know, there's young and fresh and there's kind of young and inexperienced
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.920]   and embarrassing.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.560]   And that's most of what I've seen.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:05.200]   Did you see the video a couple of weeks ago that they did where it was about a psychotherapist
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:11.800]   in New York City who undresses while she's doing psychotherapy to make her customers
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:15.320]   feel more comfortable until she gets fully naked?
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:16.320]   I'm comfortable right now.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.320]   That makes you more comfortable.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.120]   Actually, that's making me uncomfortable.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.120]   More comfortable.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.120]   You should watch the video.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:22.120]   It's actually quite funny.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:23.120]   But I actually, I thought it was just.
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.120]   Is that an onion?
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:25.120]   Is that an onion story?
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:28.560]   I thought Bara Tunde did it.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.560]   Oh, really?
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.560]   All right.
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.800]   Well, this has been so much fun.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.880]   I hate to wrap it up, but it's great to have you guys.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.360]   Of course, we thank Kevin Rose for joining us at KevinRose.com.
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.680]   Dwight Silverman at the Houston Chronicle.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:40.680]   Thank you for being here.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.680]   It's always a pleasure.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:42.880]   And this has been a great twit.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:47.640]   I think of all the twits I've done, this one has just been the best.
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.640]   Thank you guys.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.720]   Well, when you get class acts like you guys on it really does make a difference.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:54.640]   I'm going to take off my clothes next time to make you all feel more comfortable.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.720]   That's my big plan here.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:57.720]   Oh my God.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:01.960]   I saw a little hairy navel there.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.800]   We can get one of those triple X twit domains.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.800]   Oh, good idea.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:11.680]   Do you have twit?
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:12.680]   Triple X?
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.680]   You got to get it right now.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:14.680]   Because that's where you'll be.
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:15.680]   You can do it.
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:19.840]   You can build a website in two seconds.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:23.000]   Houston Chronicle blogs.com/techblog.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.080]   Thank you, Dwight.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.080]   The light Patel.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.080]   He's at reckless on Twitter.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.080]   He's pretty much it.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.080]   Free agent for what?
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.080]   Free agent.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.720]   I like it.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.720]   And Montessori kid.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.720]   Yes.
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:34.720]   Montessori.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.720]   Let's we forget.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:36.720]   We got some words to do.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.720]   Nick, what's your excuse?
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.720]   What was your educational background?
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:40.960]   I grew up in England.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.160]   I went to a private school called Barnard Castle and then I got expelled.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.600]   Isn't that the one that looks like Hogwarts?
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.760]   Exactly like Hogwarts.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:50.760]   It's like 800 years old.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:55.080]   And there's four houses and there's the Gryffindor's and then I learned that.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.080]   It's Hogwarts.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.480]   I went to Hogwarts.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:02.480]   But I was I was bad with my potions class and they kicked me out of school.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:03.480]   That's Snape.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.480]   He's such a son of a.
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.720]   And then I moved to America and then it all went down.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:12.120]   So you actually effectively went to the opposite of a Montessori school?
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.120]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:15.720]   You went to a school where they still cained the children.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:16.720]   I got cained.
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:17.720]   I got cained.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:18.720]   I got the wooden spoon.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:19.720]   I got the slipper.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:23.040]   This sounds like you played a really old game of monopoly.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.040]   I got cained.
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.040]   I got cained.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.680]   I got cained.
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:33.160]   I watched your picture of a robot with breasts and I got in front of the entire school for
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.000]   my pornography that I had created.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.560]   I got cained in front of everyone.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.200]   It wasn't fun.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.200]   Wow.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.200]   Wow.
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:44.200]   Great looking robot too.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:46.960]   Mase Meean, comfortable.
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.960]   Thank you Nick for being here.
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:48.960]   Really a pleasure.
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:49.960]   Appreciate it.
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:50.960]   And thanks to you all for joining us.
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:53.720]   Don't forget we are doing a photo walk.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.800]   What is that next week?
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:56.800]   Next Saturday.

[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:24.760]   Our photo walk brought to you by the 100% invented.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:25.760]   I'm sorry reinvented.
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:27.720]   This is a big distinction.
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:32.240]   100% reinvented 2011 Ford Explorer.

[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.040]   We had a great studio audience.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.440]   They seven people jammed in this itty bitty room and they were all nice and quiet.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:53.440]   I think most of them were sleeping actually so it's very comfortable.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.440]   I doubt it.
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.960]   I like how the sun has literally set on me.
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:00.960]   Yeah basically I'm in the pitch black now.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.640]   That's how long this show was.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:05.240]   It was high noon when we began.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:06.240]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.240]   We'll see you next week.

[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.040]   Thanks guys.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.040]   You're right Dwight.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.040]   Great awesome show.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.040]   Awesome.
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.040]   Do the twit baby.
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.040]   Do the twit.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.040]   All right.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.040]   Do the twit baby.
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:19.040]   Do the twit baby.
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.040]   Do the twit baby.
