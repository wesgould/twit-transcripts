[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.040]   I'm back, baby, and we've got a lot to talk about.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.720]   But let me first introduce the panel
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.440]   as we discuss the week's tech news starting from the--
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.640]   let's see, far right.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.800]   It's Jerry Purnell.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.240]   Jerry, our favorite science fiction author.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.800]   We love having him on JerryPurnell.com.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.400]   Regular contributor to Bite Magazine for many years,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.600]   the Chaos Manor Calm continues on website JerryPurnell.com.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.080]   What is it?
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.600]   ChaosMander.com as well.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.880]   No, somebody got that along.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.720]   No.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.760]   Just my name.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.440]   You just use my name and you get to me.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.640]   I was offered, if I paid enough money,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   to have chaosMander.com.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.440]   And I decided that wasn't--
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.160]   Nah, extortion.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.360]   It's easier to say your name.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.880]   That's easy.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.720]   If you can spell my name, you can find me.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.040]   And I'm also with Gina's new domain thing.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.920]   But I don't know how much of that's happened.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.440]   And John and I are involved in my--
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.960]   Yeah, John.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.400]   But what's fun about it, Dvorak writes for it.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.120]   And he writes non-tech stuff.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.240]   He writes about football and barbecue and stuff and hot dogs.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.720]   And if you're just throwing a thing on Chicago hot dogs,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.520]   so that's kind of a new domain.net,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.760]   I think, is the domain for that.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.640]   Yes.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.520]   On the far left, Larry Maggett from CBS Radio.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.080]   Hey, it's Crossfire.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.720]   It's just where we're fitting.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.480]   That's where you're sitting.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.240]   That's right.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.000]   Great to have you also connect safely.org is the new website.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.640]   We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.120]   And a novelist, but also entrepreneur
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.360]   and good friend Rob Reed is in studio with us.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.400]   Rob's recently written a really good novel.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.440]   You know, you might like this.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.000]   My daughter came home from the bookstore about two weeks ago.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.960]   She said, "Her really good things about the science fiction
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.320]   novel, You're Zero."
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.160]   And I said, yeah, yeah, I know a little bit about that.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.920]   The premise is that the aliens owe us a lot of money
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.280]   for copyrighted friends.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yeah, it's the tale of a vast alien civilization
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.200]   that is so into human pop music that they accidentally
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.480]   commit the biggest copyright infringement since the Big Bang,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.600]   thereby bankrupting the entire universe.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   Hilarious.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.800]   Rob knows a little bit about this.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.680]   He created Listen.com and then subsequently Rhapsody.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.880]   Yep, Rhapsody is our product.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.640]   You've actually worked with the music companies in the capacity.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   Lucky me.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.160]   Lucky me.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.640]   Yup.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.440]   And I didn't know this, but I just learned this.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.400]   You studied Arabic and international relations
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.320]   when you were a Stanford.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.520]   That's why you lived in Cairo for a half.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.800]   I did a Fulbright grant right after graduating
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.920]   and went to school on Tahrir Square.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.520]   How did you go from that to technology?
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.120]   Well, I studied Arabic and modern Middle Eastern history
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.720]   in college.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.680]   And then when I came home, I kind of went into business
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.760]   and became a consultant at Bain.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.800]   And that became a feeder to business school.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.320]   And when I was in business school,
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.720]   I'd been a generalist my whole life.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.240]   I'd been like a liberal arts major.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.760]   And--
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.480]   No, no, it's simple.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.800]   You decided you needed to make a living.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.160]   I decided I needed to pick an industry.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.440]   And I decided to come to the tech industry in '94.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.320]   A very good choice.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.360]   So I don't use my Arabic very often anymore.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.920]   No.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.320]   Unless I'm sitting next to you and you're
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.440]   showing pictures from Turkey, and I can identify them
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.360]   on a lot.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.240]   Was very impressive in the mosques.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.520]   Very, very impressive.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.480]   And also, of course, married to Morgan Webb, who--
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.960]   Now let me ask you, because G4, of course, Morgan--
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   I worked with Morgan at Tech TV.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.320]   And XPlay went on to continue as the greatest success,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.840]   not only of Tech TV, but of G4 for a long time.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   G4 got rid of everybody, announced
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.560]   that they were going to become the Esquire channel.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.960]   And most recently--
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.040]   They announced that they're not.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.440]   And that's that, well, we're not going to do anything at all.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.840]   But--
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.400]   Bizarre.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   Show reruns.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah, I think Morgan's show--
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.080]   I mean, I'm just guessing here.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.840]   It's probably on 18 times a week still.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   They continue to rerun it.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.760]   And they shot the last episode back in December.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.680]   And it's topical, like, what games come out this week?
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.180]   No.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.840]   And so I don't know.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.240]   I guess what they decided to do is they
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.000]   were going to turn the style network into the Esquire network.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.520]   And as far as I know, G4 reruns of cops and Star Trek
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.920]   and stuff like that right now.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.920]   With no original programming at all.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   It's just sitting there.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.960]   Just sitting there.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.560]   But what you don't do if you're in the cable business
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.280]   or the cable content business is give up a real estate.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.640]   I mean, that--
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.200]   Imagine not.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.600]   Having a channel nowadays is really worth something.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.760]   Picking in 70 million homes or 50, whatever the number is.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.400]   I mean, you don't do any.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.280]   It's very valuable, but it's just sitting there empty
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.120]   without any unique content.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.360]   It's still NBCUniversal.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.400]   It's still NBC Comcast.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   via Comcast.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.200]   NBCUniversal, Comcast, and Vandy, whatever the hell.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.120]   Their name of the week.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.600]   Yes.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.000]   All right.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.320]   Well, it's nice to have all three of you.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.360]   We're going to talk about the week's tech news.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.600]   And a lot of what we'll talk about is what's coming up this week.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.760]   Because this is going to be this week and next week,
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.120]   another big round of announcements.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.280]   Windows 8.1 comes out next week on the 18th,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.480]   along with the same day, new versions of Microsofts.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.360]   I'm trying to think of a good word, binited.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.860]   I don't know.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.560]   What's a good word?
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.080]   Jerry's the writer here.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.560]   So are you.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.000]   Actually, I'm surrounded by writers.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.080]   Surface tablet.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.200]   But not in some wonderful words.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.720]   I think binited might be the right word.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.760]   I don't know.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.920]   Well, it depends on whether you mean the Surface tablet as the standard one
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.240]   or the pro version, which is too expensive, but which is pretty good.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.040]   It's at least a Windows computer.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.320]   Ironically, a lot of Windows experts agree, including Paul Therat,
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   that Windows RT is really what Microsoft sees as the future
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.760]   of Windows Windows on ARM.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.440]   Well, the Surface Pro is--
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.960]   I've had one played with it for a while.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.840]   I don't have one now, but I'm thinking of getting one.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.760]   It is as close to what the original idea of a tablet was supposed to be
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.000]   as anything that's out there now.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.360]   Yeah, but the original idea is for a tablet, which Bill Gates has,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.720]   you know, kind of embraced 10 years, more than 10 years ago.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   Were flops until Apple comes along and says, no, this is what a tablet should be.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.880]   Because the technology wasn't there.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.760]   Do you remember the compact T-1000 or one-high?
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.800]   I have one.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.520]   I have one.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.200]   I've loved it.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.000]   That was my favorite computer of all time.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.240]   It was running Windows XP.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.120]   It was.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.560]   And the only problem was the processor just got too hot when it ran too fast
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.680]   and the two were to begin with anyway.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.200]   Touch-free.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   Touch-free.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.000]   It wasn't there.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   But if they had just waited until just taking that machine.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.680]   I'm going to go get mine.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.800]   I'm going to show you what it's.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.560]   OK, I've got one around here too.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.320]   I love it.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.840]   It was my favorite computer of all time.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.480]   I have a really nice iPhone in my briefcase.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.720]   Jerry, you were probably there too.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.920]   I was at Comdex when Bill Gates announced the original tablet PC.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.320]   And as I remember, it was very stylist dependent, I believe,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.480]   at the time the touch screens were not very good.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.800]   And it was kind of a clue.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.920]   Windows really-- it really wasn't optimized.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.200]   And there was really essentially no software that took advantage of touch
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.280]   or hardly any software.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.680]   It's not stylist dependent, I don't mind.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.840]   The problem was that every--
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.640]   You know why?
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.360]   Because it was designed to work with Jerry's handwriting.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.520]   Well, it was that.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.320]   I had three eyes.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.440]   Yours is the only handwriting it works with, Jerry.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.120]   That's not the only.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.000]   It was easier for me to do it than it was for you.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.040]   So this is a convertible to see how it tilts around.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.920]   And you were talking about the stylist.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.960]   It's hidden in here somewhere.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.680]   I pressed this button and it pops out, I think.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.040]   Where is it?
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.760]   It's on the side, up, up, up.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.680]   There it is.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.120]   There it is.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.280]   And--
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.240]   What's the error that, Leo?
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.800]   And you got the word.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.160]   It comes out.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.000]   And if you use that with one note,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.840]   you've got the best research device you'll ever see.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.280]   I have to admit, one of the reasons I own this
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.520]   is because I sat next to some guy on a plane who
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.520]   was a salesman, I think.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.760]   He was showing me how great it was
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.240]   to do PowerPoint presentations for his clients
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.680]   and pull out the thing and annotate it and do it.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.800]   And I thought, wow, that's great.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   And then I bought it.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.000]   And actually--
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.920]   But the processor just wasn't very--
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.480]   Well, that's the problem, right?
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.920]   And Jerry, you had an OS that wasn't designed--
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.720]   Exactly.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.280]   To do this.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.360]   Another generation-- yeah, but even with the OS,
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.720]   it wasn't exactly designed for it.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.600]   If it had just gone to the next generation of chips,
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.960]   I think that would have been a very popular thing.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.040]   It didn't have a camera built in, of course.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.680]   Oh, god, this was long before then.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.360]   I mean, this has a PC card slot.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.160]   It does have USB.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.040]   Yes.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.200]   It has Wi-Fi built in.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.240]   So I guess-- I don't know what year was this, you think?
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.480]   2004?
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.560]   I want to say it was like--
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.760]   It feels like about 10 years ago.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.400]   Maybe a little earlier than that.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.560]   I remember that I took one to a major conduct.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.600]   It was the only machine I took that year.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.000]   And I managed to follow my daily reports
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.680]   and get my column done and get everything done on it.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.880]   The keyboard wasn't optimum, and I
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.520]   would have preferred an external keyboard connected to it.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.480]   But it was good enough for that, even then
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.040]   with that hard software.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.480]   Now, of course, it certainly it recognized my handwriting
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.280]   and maybe not other people.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.240]   Jerry's told the story before, but that's--
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.520]   Should I tell it again?
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.840]   Go ahead.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.000]   Well, I was in Moscow.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.040]   And--
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.360]   And the story that begins, I was in Moscow is OK by me.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.480]   Well, it towards the end of the Soviet Union.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:32.680]   And the-- I-- a good friend became a good friend
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.120]   was Panovich, who was the head of Paragraph, which
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.480]   was doing the handwriting recognition software for Microsoft.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.860]   And he had a good friend who was at that car
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.920]   pa, who was at that time the World Chess Champion.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.480]   Oh, yeah, Alex, they carp off.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.440]   We used to go to dinner and talk, well, you know,
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.080]   I ain't a good right winger like me.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.200]   So that--
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.240]   And that means a different thing in Russia.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.200]   Yes, it did.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   Well, I'm more libertarian than--
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.040]   than crazy conservative anyway, but that's something else
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.760]   again.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.040]   But I wish sitting in his office, he said,
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.840]   my biggest problem is I don't have enough technical handwriting.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.600]   And I said, oh, well, maybe I can fix that.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.400]   And I got my log book out, you know?
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.240]   And I said, you know, it looks like this.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.560]   And the guy-- and he said, yeah, that would be wonderful,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.320]   can you?
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.800]   So I let him essentially copy all those pages.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.240]   Wow.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.720]   And that's the technical handwriting
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.760]   that was the standard for--
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.520]   so if it's going to recognize anybody,
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.120]   it's going to recognize mine.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.440]   How is your handwriting, Jerry?
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.720]   Are you like a--
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.880]   It's god awful.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.520]   OK, great.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.400]   It's really terrible.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.160]   And I figured if he can read that,
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.800]   it'll read anything.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.280]   And it did.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.200]   And of course, he's held it to Microsoft,
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.160]   and that engine has been in every edition of a Microsoft
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.240]   handwriting recognition program since 1990.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.920]   I'm just baffled that--
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.840]   I have to say, one note is a great product,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.280]   and I really have always liked it.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.560]   But it's just-- and I guess there are people who are crazy
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.000]   about it.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.520]   But the tablet never really took off until Apple came along.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.000]   And it was multi-touch.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.480]   I think made a difference.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.160]   It did not have to have a stylus.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.560]   I think that was a big selling point.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.400]   I think it was also the fact that we're all acclimated
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.320]   to the iPhone.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.480]   It gave the iPad obviously a huge leg up.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.720]   We were used to the OS, where you used to sort of the layout
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.200]   and so forth.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.720]   That's what Steve Jobs said in 2010.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.200]   He said, you already know how to use it.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.680]   And that was a big deal.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   That was a big deal.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.080]   I don't have enough money to make the bet worth well.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.080]   But I would bet that if somebody were
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   to build a copy of that device you have right there
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:56.520]   on your desk, but use it with a modern multi-processor CPU,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.600]   and modern Intel chip set.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.640]   Well, isn't that the surface?
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.040]   Well, the surface is not that.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.440]   That's the problem.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   It comes close, but they didn't do all the things that it--
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.960]   that machine has it has a keyboard, as you notice.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.480]   It's there.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   I don't have to carry a separate keyboard
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.880]   and wine blutes between it.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.560]   I had, for instance, I forget when that machine was around 2000
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.400]   or so, Niven and I were doing some major books.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.600]   And I could sit on an airplane with that when--
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.760]   and those are the days when they scrunch you up
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.040]   so that if you tried to open a real laptop, it was in your lap
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.640]   and it was right up into your face
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.680]   and you could hardly see anything.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.160]   But with that as a tablet, I could put a novel up
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   and use the stylus and do editing with just standard--
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.320]   No, Jerry, you can do this on a Lenovo
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.000]   the Yoga.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.840]   I have a Yoga 13 in it.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.680]   It feels like a Yoga.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.640]   Yoga, it's kind of interesting.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.760]   The difference is the-- with the Yoga,
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.440]   and I can go bring that in later, the screen bends backwards.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.520]   It doesn't come off.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.880]   But it does give you--
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.840]   if you don't mind carrying the extra weight of the keyboard
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.120]   with you all the time, it gives you the same benefit.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.800]   And I like that.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.840]   It's one of the few Windows 8 laptops I really enjoy using.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.920]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.080]   It's the 18th, 8.1 comes out.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.800]   I think in many ways, 8.1 answers a lot of the problems
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.960]   people have had with Windows 8 to date.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.560]   And the new Surface will come out,
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.600]   and presumably, you know, faster has will,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.880]   but we'll give it better battery life, that kind of thing.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.480]   So we'll see if it's enough.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.800]   Microsoft has 10--
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.880]   this just-- the difference between Microsoft and Apple
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.120]   is so fascinating, because for so long,
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.320]   Apple was a week second to Microsoft.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   Microsoft's going to open 10, count them 10 stores in the US
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.240]   at midnight to sell the Surface 2.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.360]   That's the best they can do, I guess.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.160]   How long are the lines going to be in the stores?
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.160]   I don't have a million times.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   You probably have enough money to make that bet.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.920]   Oh, I make that one.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.320]   I've got--
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.040]   I got the RT.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.120]   I think RT is really what's most interesting at this point
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.200]   from Microsoft.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   I know I believe that's what they believe
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.200]   is their future.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.160]   But I don't know yet.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.640]   I just don't know yet.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.600]   Well, do you think-- you know, there's
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.560]   been a lot of--
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.640]   Bombers stepping down.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.480]   I don't know who's going to be the new CEO.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.760]   There's even been apparently a call from the board
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.240]   over the last couple of weeks to get Bill Gates to step down
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   as chairman of the board.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.280]   Step down.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.480]   Wow.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.200]   Which they can't do because he votes his stock
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.480]   and his--
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.560]   He's kind of dominant.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.160]   I heard they're talking to somebody.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.920]   His heart isn't in it, obviously.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.440]   They're going to get Scully out of retirement.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.840]   Can't John Scully out of retirement?
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.920]   No, I don't think that's--
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.880]   What's he doing?
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.720]   Get Scully!
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   That's Scully.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.920]   Mostly, Scully is going around apologizing for firing Steve
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.240]   Jobs, actually, of the apologies of it.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.200]   Bill is still interested in saving the world.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.480]   And his wife is quite religious.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.800]   And they--
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.360]   Is that what's going on?
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:01.960]   I didn't--
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.920]   Melinda Gates is deeply religious.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.200]   Well, not deeply, but she's a practicing Catholic.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.280]   I didn't know that.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:09.760]   Yes, I know.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.400]   Yeah, of course, she ran the foundation
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.960]   while Bill was still running Microsoft.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.440]   Bill always said, I'm not going to give away any money
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.520]   until I could do it right.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.720]   I don't want to just go through money away.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.560]   Well, you're understanding she's a very sharp lady.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.320]   She was a product manager for Microsoft.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.720]   She didn't get that job.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.800]   She didn't get that job.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.520]   She showed you Bob?
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.480]   She showed me Bob.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.000]   I remember.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   And I forgive her for that.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.960]   Actually, Bob was sort of interesting
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.800]   if you thought of it as a juvenile program.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.080]   OK, as a kids program.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.080]   Now you've redeemed yourself.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.160]   I got a lot of great columns out of it.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.040]   Are you kidding?
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.360]   It was like a gift to those of us who have come up.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.920]   I was waiting for Jerry to go out on the limb and say,
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.840]   Bob was good.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.360]   But no, you redeemed yourself.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.200]   It's just for kids.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.840]   It would be good.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.760]   As a kids program, it was very good.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.480]   It was--
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.080]   It had some of that flavor of the iPad where it says,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.240]   you already know how to use it.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.120]   It's all kind of good.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.080]   It wasn't the flavor I was tasting.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.680]   I had a shout out for Clippy while we were at it.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.080]   I'm so--
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.520]   Miss Clippy.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.240]   Surfing the internet, which was not in those days very commonly.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.080]   I see you would like to surf the internet.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.400]   Can I make a list for you?
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.160]   The other thing is the dog to give you advice.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.040]   And I love dogs.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   But they're not known for their intellectual.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.920]   And they're not the species I would go to for technical--
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.920]   Well, that's not the only announcement this week.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.600]   There's more to come.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.920]   We're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.880]   We've got a fun panel here.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.960]   Jerry Pournell, Larry Magget, and of course Rob Reed.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.120]   Rob, by the way, I didn't know this.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.800]   You just whispered in my ear that year zero is a 99 cent deal
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.680]   right now on Amazon for the next several days.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.040]   So Random House has-- and I think it's awesome
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.400]   that they're experimenting with pricing
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.440]   because that's how you learn how to survive
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.120]   a digital transition.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.480]   Random House is pricing the e-book at 99 cents for,
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.680]   I think most of the coming week, maybe even all of them.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.080]   Well worth picking up.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.640]   The hardcover was 22.5% so it wasn't me.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.600]   Yeah, that's why you can't let me offer my observation.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.480]   I make quite a lot of money out of electronic books
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.360]   of my backlist now.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.400]   And we have found that between $3.99 and $5.99,
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.480]   it's practically price insensitive.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.280]   Interesting.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.040]   Yep.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.600]   So do you charge $5.99 for everything?
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.360]   I have a fair minute with it.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.200]   We have taken books and put them up at lower prices
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.640]   and then at higher and shuffled it around
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.400]   and compared this stuff with some statistical techniques.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.000]   And it's really pretty well priced incentives in that range.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.080]   Once it gets over about six bucks,
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.440]   people start thinking about whether they want it or not.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.560]   But up to that, if they decide they want it,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.240]   they just get it, it's easy click click and there it is.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.480]   Well, 99 cents is definitely the impulse.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.360]   Oh, and 99 cents is free.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:47.880]   Right.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.480]   But I don't know that--
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.160]   Do you think he's leaving money on the table?
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.440]   He's leaving five bucks on the table.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.400]   I think he's leaving several dollars on the table.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.560]   Oh, there's no doubt.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.200]   I think it's interesting because, well,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.440]   I'm a first time novelist.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.880]   So very few people have heard of Robbery,
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.440]   the science fiction novelist.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.640]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.120]   Yeah, from my standpoint, I just think it's great that--
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.040]   I mean, the book has done reasonably well.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.600]   It was in two hardcover printings.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.520]   And it sold in the tens of thousands,
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.800]   which is good for a first novel.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.320]   But I'm just excited that this should, I think,
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.360]   expand the audience a lot, at least for a week.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.560]   But if it gets out there and more people read it,
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.680]   I think that Random House's thinking here
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.400]   is in getting the ebook out there very inexpensively.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.840]   Maybe people will discover it in advance of the holidays
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.720]   and give it to their geeky friends or something like that.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.000]   The paperbacks recently out.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.680]   So that's probably part of the thinking.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.360]   What's the press run on the paperback?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.720]   I'm sorry, what's the press run?
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.200]   Press run.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.440]   I actually don't know.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.000]   I'm not really good at knowing these things.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I think the first hardcover I think they told me was 14,000.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.200]   And then they printed another run.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.560]   And I don't know how much that was.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.800]   I never wanted to know.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.000]   Yeah, because you know the numbers are depressingly low.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.480]   Right?
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.480]   It's like, really?
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   OK, I don't want to know that.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.120]   We're not in the league of Jerry pornell at this point.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.240]   You're zero and novel, not year one, which was your first book.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.720]   Yes.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.640]   Unrelated to this book.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.160]   Unrelated.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:11.600]   Unrelated.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.440]   Very confusingly unrelated to this book.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.560]   That was a kind of a memoir of life in business school.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.000]   And this is about our music-addled aliens.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.640]   I love that premise.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.720]   Isn't it a great idea?
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.120]   Why did you do?
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.240]   You know what Jerry, you got-- I didn't know you hadn't read it.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:26.680]   You got to read it.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.800]   I'm sure I will send you a comment.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.840]   Yeah, I will.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.640]   For 99 cents, who cares?
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.600]   I'll just go out and get it right there.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.840]   You know, you just made a book.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.000]   This is how you expand.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.640]   No, I think I just made a cent.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.960]   Do they change your world's rate to percentage?
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:39.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.520]   I think so.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.360]   You're not making much.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.480]   Maybe a couple cents a percentage.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.560]   Oh, my world's rate on 99 cents is 30%.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.080]   They have $3.99 and above it's 70%.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.760]   Exactly.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.320]   Oh, interesting.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.720]   I think even my publisher is getting 30 cents at 99 cents.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.600]   And then I get a sliver that my agent gets her $15.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.120]   I think I get about a penny a book.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.920]   So you know, but you don't write comedic science fiction
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.080]   strictly to get rich.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.960]   It's a bad way.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.480]   I got to say, though, if you willing to spend a little more
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.280]   get the audible edition because John Hodgman reads it.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.880]   That kind of brings it to life.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.640]   You don't write it.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.760]   I completely agree with Samuel Johnson.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.520]   Nobody but a blockhead ever wrote the second novel
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.360]   for anything but money.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.200]   This is the first one, though.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.240]   Why didn't I?
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.640]   I only read Samuel Johnson.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.520]   I would have saved me a few books.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.080]   Taking a break coming back with more.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.040]   Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   The post office is closed.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.840]   Yes.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.640]   But stamps.com is open.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.120]   This is the time to strike stamps.com.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.160]   It's always open 24/7.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.040]   You print your own postage with your--
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.120]   it's not Leo post.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.400]   Actually, you can't print it with your picture on it, by the way.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.160]   I bought a bunch of Leo stamps.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.880]   But it's still official US postage.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.320]   You don't need a special ink or a postage meter.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.120]   In fact, the other day I was reading
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.720]   the cost of the ink on a postage meter
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.240]   is something like 100 times more than ink jet ink,
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.800]   which is already outrageous.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.640]   Wow.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.720]   It's just a-- you don't need a postage meter.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.960]   You just need stamps.com, your own printer, your own computer.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.960]   And you can save money on international mail.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.000]   You can save money on priority mail.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.080]   It'll do everything you need.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.920]   You'll never have to go to the post office again.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.720]   Even-- is mail delivery?
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.680]   Does mail carrier still come into the door?
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.040]   I think so.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.480]   I think so.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   I think so.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.520]   I think they're quasi-independent.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.040]   Oh, that's right.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.200]   They're not a quarrel--
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.120]   that's right.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.920]   They're doing their own thing.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.240]   If they weren't doing it, then this
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.360]   would be a bad time to promote stamps.com,
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   because you could buy this.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.040]   It's being a delivery.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.840]   But there would be no assessment delivery.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.440]   No, there is.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.240]   We have delivery.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.360]   It's delivery is on, I believe.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.160]   Stamps.com customers printed over $1 billion
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.360]   with a B dollars in postage just last year alone.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.560]   It is fabulous.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.400]   We use it all the time here in the office,
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.280]   and we want to give you a chance to try it out.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.760]   Small business, big business, it doesn't matter.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.360]   Stamps.com is better than the way you're doing it.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.720]   I guarantee you.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.240]   Now, you're going to go to the front page.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.200]   You see the $80 no risk trial.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.240]   Do me a favor.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.640]   Click the microphone.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.560]   It says, here, "Ered us on a radio or podcast."
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.000]   Click the microphone, and enter in the offer code TWIT.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And your offer will be $110 bonus value,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.680]   because they up the free postage-- $50, $5, up to $55
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.320]   in postage coupons to be used over the first few months
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.280]   of your account.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.040]   You also get that USB scale, which
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.320]   means you never over or underpay for postage.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.880]   You get a $5 supply kit.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.840]   And of course, the four week trial of stamps.com.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.320]   Really a great company and a great solution.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.640]   I want you to try it.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.200]   And yes, it works even during federal shutdown.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.880]   Stamps.com.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.800]   We were talking about that before the show began.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.120]   There's a beautiful tourist destination in San Francisco
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.120]   called the Cliff House, which is out on beautiful and ocean
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   beach.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.080]   And it's of course, shut down, because they're
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.720]   a concessionaire of the federal government.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.000]   It's a private company, but it's on federal land,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.600]   on park land.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.160]   So the land molecules can't work.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.760]   And therefore, the business must close.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.920]   The restaurant, which is staffed with non-federal employees,
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.680]   cannot open because the land molecules are furloughed.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.240]   Bazaar.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.200]   And then up to--
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.240]   literally, half a block away is Louis,
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.360]   where you can get a great burger,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.560]   but it's kind of like a small place.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.200]   And it's still open, even though they're also--
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   they're a lacy instead of a concessionaire.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.520]   And so they're allowed to run, but not-- it's very confusing.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.120]   They're both on park land.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.080]   It's very strange.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.040]   So if you're coming to San Francisco,
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.880]   wait until the shutdown is over.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.960]   The city's OK, though.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.560]   It's still going.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.200]   Just don't try to go to Alcatraz, right?
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.760]   That's going to be close, right?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.000]   We had Ranger Craig from Alcatraz
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.400]   was in the studio audience this week.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.160]   I said, Ranger, what are you doing here, Sid?
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.280]   I got nothing to do.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:43.840]   Furloughed.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.480]   Furloughed?
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.440]   I'm out.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.280]   Sitting around.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.960]   He brought me Al Capone's cup.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.800]   Awesome.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.680]   Well, sweet.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.600]   I thought--
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.880]   Here, here it comes.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.360]   I got to--
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.880]   Do you have a sticker on the bottom that said 5.99?
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.520]   No, yeah, yeah, look at this.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.600]   It's Al Capone's tin cup from Alcatraz.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.160]   Look at that.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.600]   Except on the bottom, it says in fine print reproduction.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.200]   But I--
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   Maybe that's that.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   Look at that.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   Let me out of here.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.120]   Let me out of here.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.280]   One, one.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.840]   Bang, bang, bang.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.080]   I got you both.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:16.880]   Did you-- you both?
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.360]   Good.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:17.880]   Look at that.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   Look at that.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.160]   That's on my candle.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.560]   That's just how easy it is.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.720]   And John has done it too.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.000]   So you've made two cents.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.520]   And Jerry, you rocked my world by laughing so hard at the premise.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   I'm delighted if you find it to be a fun idea.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.800]   That's really cool.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.920]   OK, now you're getting 99 cents.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.720]   You're getting 30 cents, or--
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.880]   Random house is getting 30 cents.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.240]   What?
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.640]   Random house.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.080]   So Amazon takes 70%.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:41.640]   Is that right?
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.360]   If you're under $2.99--
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.480]   and Jerry correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.560]   My understanding is if you charge less than $2.99,
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.640]   and you take 70%, if you charge between $2.99 and $9.99,
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.200]   it's a strong nudge to use that price range.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.560]   You get 70%.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.360]   So they invert it.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.400]   But I guess his Random House has their own deal.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.480]   Why would Amazon not want 99 cent books?
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:08.280]   Because they're priced in-- because the sales are essentially
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.320]   priced in different above that.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.160]   They made the same observation you did.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.800]   Because they made the same observation that we did.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.280]   Now, my books are some of them I put up myself just
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.560]   to make sure I knew how to do it.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.000]   Most of them are put up by my agent,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.760]   who was the agent for the book in the hardbound editions
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.280]   in the first place.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.960]   We get 70%.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.080]   She takes 15% off the 70% and sends the rest to me.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.640]   And Amazon, unlike most publishers, Amazon pays monthly,
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.280]   not just on credible threat of lawsuit.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.560]   And they don't accumulate six months worth and pay it to you.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.080]   They pay it monthly.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.640]   Are these books during the year making
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.160]   published $3,000 a month off of my books?
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.920]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.480]   I think that's correct.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.520]   They gave their self-published books,
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.720]   not books that published through it.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   These are basically self-published.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   You've got to remember, Lucifer's Hammer
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.360]   was written in 1974.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.120]   Nobody bought electronic rights in 1974.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.600]   I haven't.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.480]   They know what they were.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.360]   And I never sold them when they began to exist.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.120]   I always crossed anything like that.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.920]   I was out of my contracts.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.160]   Unlike a lot of my friends who didn't take my advice,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.080]   and some of them are now having to split their money
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.000]   with the publishers, but I assume the publisher gives you
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.640]   half of what it gets.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.840]   I don't know.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.000]   With the electronic, I think it's the same royalty rate.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Or maybe it's 20%, which I think is a little higher
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.280]   than physical books.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.640]   I'm really syndicated.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.320]   So we assume that's right.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.880]   Look at it carefully or talk to your agent about it,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.320]   because that's a bad contract.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.120]   Your agent should be--
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.880]   Oh, I know.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   First time novel is a--
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.720]   First time listener.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.640]   --a hard time listener.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.560]   Totally new.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.760]   Yes, totally newbie.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.760]   Percent to look out for your interest for God's sake.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.040]   So I mentioned that Windows 8.1 comes out this week.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.120]   We don't know, but we think the Nexus 5
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.360]   is going to be out the new Google phone.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.460]   This is a video that appeared on smartphones.sfr,
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.080]   that FR of something that absolutely
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.160]   looks like a Nexus 5.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.160]   This was posted to Android police.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.520]   It is built by LG.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.520]   We do think we know that.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.760]   It is running the new version KitKat.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.440]   Although it says, if you look closely, your key lime pie.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.240]   Wow.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.960]   That seems wrong.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.040]   Key lime pie.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.440]   Right letter with a K.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.240]   Maybe that was before Nestle came in with a big kit.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.800]   Well, that's what's weird about this,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.960]   because it was going to be key lime pie with a--
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.720]   That makes sense.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.320]   That's consistent with your typical--
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.960]   So it puzzles me whether the validity of this, perhaps.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.880]   In the article, it says that it's just running
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.120]   an older version of the software.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.160]   But the hardware seems to be a prototype.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.840]   Because if you look on the back, there isn't even Nexus branding.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.720]   It's a clear back.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.200]   So somebody got this in a bar somewhere.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.360]   And so we do know that this coming,
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.440]   because it got through FCC certification
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.520]   right up to the point where the government shut down.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.000]   That's something, by the way, I didn't really
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.520]   thought of, but that could slow down
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.320]   release of new phones, because FCC certification is held up now.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.840]   Yeah, I guess it would be.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.320]   So we thought that there were rumors
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.200]   that we'd expect this on Monday, perhaps.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:22.560]   I don't know.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.720]   We'll be interested.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.040]   The Nexus phones are very-- people
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.720]   are very interested in those Nexus phones.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   For several reasons, one, it's a pure Google experience.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.560]   It's somewhat guaranteed to have the latest version.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.160]   In fact, this would be the first phone with Android 4.4
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:43.080]   available, but also because Google at least has been very cheap.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.880]   The Nexus 4 was like 230 bucks.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   And this one's going to be a good one.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.200]   I think the sheer Google experience thing
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.520]   should not be underestimated.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.120]   Because unlike Samsung and HTC and all the other vendors,
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.000]   Google doesn't put extra stuff on top of the operating system,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.280]   force you to use and use their interface that you don't want.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.840]   Google engineers actually understand something about UI.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.880]   They keep it simple.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.760]   You're going to be on the same hardware.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.400]   It's going to be faster.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.520]   And people actually pay extra, for example,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:15.560]   for a Samsung Galaxy 4 that doesn't have the Samsung stuff on.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.920]   The hardware is fine.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.360]   It's the--
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.920]   How's the camera?
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.720]   It's great.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.640]   It's adequate.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.840]   We don't know on the Nexus 5.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.520]   The Nexus 4 camera wasn't great, but it was OK.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.640]   I mean, the camera software or the camera hardware?
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.040]   Both.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.880]   One thing that keeps me with Apple
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.760]   is that I don't have to carry an actual camera.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.720]   Because the iPhone is just a good enough camera.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.280]   Well, especially with the new iPhone, there's no question
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.120]   this is still the best camera out there.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.520]   I do think the Galaxy S--
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.160]   Yeah, they have-- OK, so the Galaxy S4--
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.600]   and by the way, I have a Galaxy Note 3,
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.080]   which has the same camera.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.280]   13 megapixels is a very good camera.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.360]   But something about Apple, what they do--
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.840]   I don't know if it's a software--
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.800]   but they consistently still, I think, produce the most accurate--
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.960]   I feel like I've got a better sensor than there.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.840]   I took an iPhone 5S and an iPhone 5,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.280]   and held them next to each other,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.600]   took identical pictures in the same lighting.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.960]   In every single case, the 5S was dramatically better.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.320]   Wow.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:11.800]   And the 5.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.280]   And I never knew the 5 was bad.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:13.960]   I loved my 5.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.720]   I know.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.520]   I mean, that's improving on what was the best camera out there.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.200]   So this is an F2 aperture.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.680]   So it's a little bit better in low light.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.240]   It's the same number of lenses.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.160]   But maybe they've done something with the coatings
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.760]   or something.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.440]   But you were mentioning Rob the Flash.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.080]   The dual light.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.480]   Yeah, I think the fact that they can do automatic white balance.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.600]   And I think they have 1,000 different settings or something
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.840]   that they pivot between is probably
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.480]   what it's going to make.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.280]   There's really, really visible impact on any image that
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.640]   actually uses the flash.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.280]   I mean, I think that's a fast--
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.480]   I mean, I don't have one yet.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.080]   So I'm just parroting what I've read.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.640]   But that feels like a major, major step forward,
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.160]   whereas there's not a lot else that doesn't
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.240]   seem in the lens array or in the sensor that's
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.120]   radically different.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.280]   No, in fact, I think they're buying Sony sensors.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.320]   The other thing would be, of course, the software.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.560]   And I think something about what happened.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:06.880]   Let me see.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.040]   I don't know if the flash would go off here.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.000]   No, I wish I could get the flash to go off.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.160]   Maybe I'll shoot my crotch.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.560]   I'll shoot my crotch.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.080]   Shoot yourself.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.480]   You should get modded on.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.920]   A little selfie.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.560]   It's Andrew Wiener's style.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.360]   I'll just turn it on.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.440]   How about that?
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.040]   Let's see.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.480]   Shoot under the table.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.720]   Leo Wiener.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.200]   Thank you.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.000]   Thank you.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.240]   Thank you very much.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.320]   So this is-- yeah, you know what that looks like for your shot
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.600]   under the table?
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.240]   That looks pretty good.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.680]   Yeah, John, I've got to talk to you about your wiring.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.080]   You can't really see that on camera.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.160]   But it's actually quite a nice, accurate shot.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.280]   So what we've done is there's a warm
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.840]   and there's a cool LED, and they will mix the two depending.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.880]   So apparently it takes two pictures.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.240]   As soon as it assesses the white balance,
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.080]   it will then balance these little flashes to make that work.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.160]   You know, somebody's saying, well, what about the Lumia 1020?
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.520]   Everybody agrees that's a better camera.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.120]   I don't know.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.200]   I think this is still a better camera.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.960]   Larry, have you tried both the 1020?
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.840]   Yeah, I have.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.960]   And I think that the Lumia 1020, the big deal, of course,
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.760]   is it, what, 44 megapixels?
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.720]   41 megapixels.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.040]   40 megapixels, so you can crop or take of them.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.440]   But for the kind of pictures that I use my smartphone for,
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.600]   look, it's not an SLR.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.560]   I don't use it when I'm going off to Africa to a Safari,
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.000]   and I want to get the best possible picture that elephant,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.160]   you know, 50 feet away.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.080]   It's the camera you use when you're out to dinner,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   when you're going about your business.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.400]   And the iPhone is much more than adequate
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.360]   for the kind of snapshots that I use it for.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.400]   And, yeah, there's a lot of better.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.400]   You can argue it is based on that cropping,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.480]   but then you have to take into consideration
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.640]   the simplicity of the software,
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.240]   the entire user interface, and at the end of the day,
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.920]   I'm sticking with the iPhone.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.560]   It just seems more, to me, more satisfying.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.560]   Yeah, it's ineffable.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.920]   And the best camera is the one that you have with you.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.920]   Well, that's not worth it.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.400]   And then also, you know, the one that you're going to use the most.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.880]   And so I think, you know, in complete agreement with Larry said,
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.000]   if it's friction-free and it's easy to use and it's in your pocket,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.480]   that's the best possible camera.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.560]   How do I mean megapixels?
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.120]   I mean, there's just not enough lens in these things
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.920]   to really take full advantage of a 21 megapixels shot.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   I would rather than have another dozen megapixels,
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.440]   and I'm sure we won't see this for a while,
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.400]   I personally would rather have a camera that shoots in RAW,
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.840]   because you can do a lot with a RAW file
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.440]   if you have software like Lightroom and so forth.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.760]   So rather than get bazillion more megapixels,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.960]   I would rather shoot in RAW and have some fun with the image
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.720]   that I couldn't necessarily have with the JPEG,
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.000]   but that's on the extreme edge case.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.520]   So that's what you can probably also have an FLR
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.360]   or other camera.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.200]   I do, yeah.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.080]   I've got the phony RX100, which is a pocket-sized camera.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.080]   Amazing camera.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:53.920]   I had that theory.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.920]   Good.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   That's what I carry these days.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.360]   I don't even carry my FLR ever.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   I will leave.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.840]   I just went on safari, so I carried my SLR for the first time
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.320]   in a really long time, because the RX100
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.480]   is a mind-blowingly good camera.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.640]   600 bucks.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   Yep.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.640]   It's a point and shoot.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.000]   It's a point and shoot that shoots in RAW,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.360]   it has Carl Zeiss lens, it's got ample megapixels.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.720]   It's 20 something, I think.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   20.2.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   Plenty.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.360]   And it's got incredible low noise performance.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.760]   I took it to see--
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.760]   Is it an X-more?
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   Sensors?
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.200]   They're using their high-end sensor.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   Yeah, it's expensive.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.520]   I took it, because I figured I could get it into a concert when
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.680]   the stones came around a few months ago.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.880]   It's so funny, they won't let you then measure the lens.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   Yes.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.720]   They'll actually measure, and you can have a three-inch or less.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.520]   I had this little box.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.520]   They're not going to stop you.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.520]   So no, they didn't.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.440]   I got-- I mean, the pictures that I got, obviously,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   I'm an easy judge of my own pictures, but I thought they were
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   phenomenal.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.720]   And so the low-light performance is incredible.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.080]   And the strange color performance and all those things
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.000]   you have in a concert.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.440]   But the key was it does shoot in RAW.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440]   And so if you do--
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.080]   Once you get the image, if you're pretty good in light room
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.960]   or another RAW processing program, you can do amazing things
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.160]   with the beautiful images that the RX100 gets.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.840]   Can you see this, guys?
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.240]   Can you see this guy?
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.680]   Show what is that?
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.400]   It's the iPhone next to the RX100.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.800]   I mean, it's smaller than the RX100.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.080]   It's thicker than it's thicker.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.760]   And I've got the lens full out.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.040]   But it does fit easily into a pant pocket.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.640]   Sony's killing it.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.840]   The NEX series for these more prosumer-grade interchangeable
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.480]   lens, I gave my son for--
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.680]   there's a Santa Rainy.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.240]   Look at that.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.560]   I gave my son for a graduation present in NEX 7.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.800]   And he's loving it.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.840]   And the images he gets, those E-series lenses are really,
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.560]   really good.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.600]   And again, getting back--
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.560]   We're going in Santa Rainy.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.520]   We went to Ia, of course.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.360]   And we were only there for a day.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.000]   We were on a cruise, but we just got back from the Greek
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   islands.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.360]   It was gorgeous.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.600]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:38:01.320]   I spent a week in Santa Rainy with the head of the Greek
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.320]   culture.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.240]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:10.720]   At the palace down where they dug up the old palace
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.320]   of the Minoan civilization there, I was going to write a novel.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.040]   They think it might be Atlantis.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040]   Atlantis.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.800]   Of course, was that--
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.360]   it's Faradon Maranados.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   It's the guy.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.720]   I spent a week with him.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.520]   He was the one who came up with that hypothesis in 1939.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.000]   And I was going to write a novel about it.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.560]   But the problem was that the civilization was so damn
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.560]   attractive that I really had trouble writing a novel about a
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.000]   disaster that wiped it out.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.040]   I just literally had emotional problems, right?
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.040]   I don't blame you.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.200]   Something else.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.880]   But I loved Santa Rainy.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.080]   I spent a week-- we have a scene set on Santa Rainy and
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:59.040]   Lucifer's hammer with some people up on Mount Prophet Elias
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.480]   when the comet hits.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.320]   Acrotiri is the archaeological--
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.920]   As long as you're doing travel--
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.440]   Acrotiri is what, yes, right.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.920]   So I'm headed to Bali next week.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   Believe it or not, on business, at the internet governance
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   point, I'm with a bunch of jet setters on this show.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.720]   Anybody out there knows interesting things due to Kibali.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.600]   Go to LarryThworld.com and find or any of these websites
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.920]   and send me a note.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   Mostly just lying on the beach, I think.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.560]   But I don't know.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.440]   There's amazing temples there, actually.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.320]   What's cool not to turn this into a travelogue.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.440]   What's amazing was in Bali, was it?
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:27.960]   I don't know.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.440]   I haven't read it.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.000]   I haven't read it.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.960]   But what's great about Bali is it has a lot of really
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.400]   magnificent temples and things that you see in lots of
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.120]   countries.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.480]   But what's cool about Bali is it's a very living religion.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.640]   Like all those temples, grand and ancient as they are,
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.600]   are used every day.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.560]   So it's very vibrant.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.040]   That's neat.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:45.840]   It's really vibrant.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.080]   It's an interesting place.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.000]   And make sure you go to Ubed.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.200]   Everybody will tell you that.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.160]   But that's a cool city in the center of the island.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:51.920]   That has a lot to it.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.040]   Every time I'm about to travel, I'll have to come on Leo's
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.080]   show to get something like that.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   Exactly.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   OK.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:56.720]   Wow.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.960]   If you ever plan on getting married and you're not
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.040]   particular about the religion in which you were married,
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.400]   David M and his wife were married on Bali about 25 years
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:08.840]   ago.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.120]   And from everything she has told me, it was the most
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.280]   magnificent wedding I've ever heard of.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.080]   It was--
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.080]   No Elvis impersonates.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.000]   It was one of those rituals.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.880]   One of the-- she didn't understand half the ritual, of
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.400]   course.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.440]   But it's valid in the United States.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.560]   And they--
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.600]   What is the religion?
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.560]   It's actually in Bali.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.200]   It's Hindu.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.960]   So it's an overwhelmingly Muslim country in Indonesia,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.400]   of course.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.760]   But Bali is a predominantly--
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.480]   not entirely, but predominantly Hindu island.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.360]   But it's also kind of an unusual branch of the Hindu
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:41.760]   religion.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.240]   It's not as Hinduism as typically practiced in India.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.120]   But that's where my knowledge runs out.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.400]   But it's predominantly Hindu, which is very unusual in
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.160]   Indonesia.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.680]   Getting back to the Google phone.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.160]   Yes, indeed.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.800]   The Google experience.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.920]   I have to underscore what you're saying, Larry.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.440]   Although that's only recent.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.600]   You know, the first Google phones, the first versions of
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.360]   Android cupcake and donut and declare, we're god awful.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:05.560]   And--
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.040]   Yeah, they were.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.960]   At the time, I think-- and I actually spoke to the guy who
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.200]   designed Motorola Blur.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.600]   And he said, at the time we had to, not merely for
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.640]   carrier differentiation or manufacturer differentiation,
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.040]   but because Google really hadn't nailed it yet.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:25.480]   But I think since-- certainly since ice cream sandwich,
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.160]   the OS finally has a good UI.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.520]   And these carrier or manufacturer extensions really aren't
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.080]   any good.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.920]   I have a Note 3 here, which I love the hardware of.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   But god, the touch whiz is--
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.960]   it's non-standard.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.520]   And so it just seems to get in the way, right?
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.880]   It's got weird--
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:50.440]   this got four pages of settings, which makes it very
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.560]   difficult to figure out what's going on.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.240]   Of course, it's got all the galaxy cruft.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.400]   And that takes up a lot of space on these things.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.560]   I had a very, very early Android.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.240]   I don't remember what OS it was, but it was maybe a year
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:04.680]   into it.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.160]   And at that point, the design philosophy seemed to be
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.680]   why click once when you can click four times.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.760]   And it kind of drove me nuts.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.320]   And I fled back to the iPhone.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.400]   But I've been hearing wonderful things
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.560]   about the recent releases.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.360]   Let me show you, for instance--
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.680]   Leo, are you going to forgive me if I keep my iPhone?
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.960]   Keep your eye-- forgive you.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.000]   What do you think is sitting here right next to me?
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   It's a gold.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.240]   Well, I'm the guy who stayed with the iPhone during that period
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.760]   when you trashed it every possible time you could
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.280]   on the radio.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.760]   Oh, I think you're being hard on me.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.280]   I actually-- I still prefer Android for a number of reasons.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.520]   But I don't say you shouldn't have an iPhone.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.000]   I think for a lot of people, the iPhone's
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.240]   absolutely the right choice.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.680]   But here's an example.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.400]   It's very clear.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.000]   As you said, it's Apple's Wear the Highway.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.480]   Apple has a way of doing it.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.680]   You can't do it any other way.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.720]   But if you like the way Apple does it, stick with it.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.480]   The advantage, of course, of Android
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.360]   is you can anything you want.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.760]   But here's a good example.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.000]   This is Samsung's camera app, which
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.240]   is so loaded with bizarre junk.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   That's bad.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.200]   You don't need-- frankly, I don't need a golf mode.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.040]   I need--
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.360]   Fireworks on the beach mode.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.600]   I do not need some of these.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.040]   Here's Best Face.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.200]   It takes five consecutive pictures.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.520]   And then you smoosh the ones of the different faces,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.680]   and it merges them into one.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.640]   Is there a baseball in the snow mode?
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.720]   I've always wanted that.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   Well, that's probably this sports mode in--
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.840]   I'm a true left-handed baseball.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.760]   This is like Crayola, 928 settings.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.080]   It's nuts.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.160]   That is madness.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.280]   How about summoning demons mode?
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.840]   No, my wife just-- she misplaced her HTC phone
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.120]   when we were traveling, and I gave her a Samsung Galaxy S4.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.160]   And back to the learning curve.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.440]   She didn't know how to use it.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.840]   She was a smart lady.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.200]   And I use Galaxy--
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   I use Galaxy phones at an S2, S3, S4.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.400]   And so I know how to use it.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.160]   But I don't want it.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.280]   I don't want it.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.280]   And so I could see why there's a market.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.440]   That's why there's a lot of interest in the Nexus 5.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.360]   It's not merely prices.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.840]   As you said, Larry, it's the cleanliness of the interface.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.800]   The Moto X, which is what I took on my trip
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.840]   and what I continue to use, is kind of the best of both worlds.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.480]   There are some Motorola improvements,
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.840]   but it's essentially Google.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.200]   And I'm very happy with that.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.120]   The other thing that fascinates me about the note
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.360]   is just how big it is.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.880]   When I compare that to the iPhone,
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   it looks like-- you know what it reminds me of?
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.640]   The new Fox News Studio that I have a--
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.960]   Yeah, big ass tablets.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.440]   Aren't those notes?
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.400]   Galaxy Notes is huge, 80-inch.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.520]   Actually, what those are-- and that's a-- in fact,
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.760]   we should probably show that video.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.600]   It is very funny.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.040]   It looks like there's something wrong.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.200]   Like maybe they've hired tiny interns.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.480]   Tiny interns.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.520]   It looks like something out of the onion.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.560]   I thought it was an onion.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.480]   And I think that those are Galaxy Notes.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.280]   I really-- no, I'm kidding.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.120]   I'll tell you what they are.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.080]   They're pixel perfect.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.800]   Yeah, they're at 55-inch.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.840]   It's what Microsoft bought this company.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.520]   They make an 85 and a 55.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.000]   Oh, God.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.360]   But what's weird is it's 1080p.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.880]   So it's not super high resolution.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.240]   And these poor guys, look at this guy on the right.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.880]   Who's tapping over and over again, I might add.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.920]   The same tweet.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.880]   And it's giant.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.560]   It's huge.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.320]   The pixels are like one square inch on that.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.640]   They get the 80-inch one.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.040]   They get the 80-inch one.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.000]   I feel bad mocking Shepherd Smith.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.280]   Because poor Shepherd Smith, this is his new show.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.800]   And somebody had the bright idea.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.760]   Let's build a set that is somehow modern.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.960]   And they say in this, and I think this is true.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.760]   We're having a hard time reaching a new generation of people
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.840]   who don't consume news in a linear fashion.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.040]   So I know, get big touch screens.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.280]   That's going to get them in.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.960]   No, they won't.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.440]   They'll want to watch that.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.640]   It's linear news, but there are big touch screens
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.760]   in the background.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.640]   And then--
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.080]   And I don't know if you could find this, Shepherd.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.000]   There's a hysterical segment where they have a giant wall
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.080]   with tweets.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.800]   And they have three columns.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.320]   They have breaking tweets, unconfirmed tweets,
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.200]   and then confirmed tweets.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.120]   And they say, our staff is going through--
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.920]   this is how they're gathering news.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.560]   Going through tweets to see if they're real.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.000]   And then we move them into the confirmed column.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.720]   With a big arm motion.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.240]   They did their own research.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.760]   They actually did reporting.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:21.000]   This is what Fox News isn't using huge tablets on the set.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.080]   They just hired a bunch of really small staffers.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.960]   Andre yesterday wrote that tweet.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.480]   That was Padra SJ's tweet.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:30.880]   It's a problem.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.600]   It's not just Fox.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.720]   It's a problem all television is having right now.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.640]   It's reaching anybody under 35.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.360]   We just found out that the millennials are not--
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.800]   like 50% of the millennials never watch television.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   Like never.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.560]   Hey, Leo, why do you think they advertise Lipitor
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.000]   on the evening news?
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.680]   It's not going to be--
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.280]   Well, I'm fascinated by those ads.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.040]   I'm trying to decide which blood pressure medicine is best for me.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.080]   And so I'm glad that they have those ads.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.600]   They're very timely for people like me.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.560]   Well, you and I are--
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.120]   --were their audience.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.000]   Were their audience--
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.120]   Is that John Stewart?
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.800]   I swear I thought this was an onion.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.200]   Well, when I saw that, I thought it was--
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.880]   I momentarily thought it was John Stewart.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.480]   I was like, OK, here comes the joke.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.600]   And then, see, there it is.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.800]   There's the call-- the Twitter call.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.240]   I feel like this is kind of shooting ducks in a pond.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   Mission control.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   Yeah, it's like--
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.720]   I'm like, the size of tweets.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.440]   Oh, and they call them bats, right?
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.040]   Big area tapest.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.640]   He said big area touch screens.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.480]   But we know bat stands for Big Ass Table.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.240]   No doubt.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.320]   Absolutely.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.920]   All right.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.360]   Let's take a break.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.400]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   We're having fun getting through the news.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.800]   iPhone 5S, we might talk a little bit about that.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.680]   A couple of weeks later, it came out while I was gone.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.560]   I was able to get one, the fingerprint scanner.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.400]   Is this making a difference?
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.640]   To go with the Note 3, I've got the Galaxy Gear watch.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.440]   We could talk a little bit about that.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:52.080]   Some big changes in privacy settings on Google and Facebook.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.440]   There's a lot to talk about, including Nick Bilton's new book.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.320]   We're going to try to get Nick soon on one of our shows.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.880]   We love Nick, New York Times writer.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.880]   His new book is a very interesting, I thought.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.840]   At least the excerpts I read history of Twitter.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   It was mind blowing.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   Wasn't that amazing?
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   Oh, gosh.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   All right.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.840]   Lots to talk about.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:15.040]   And Comic-Con hijacking its users Twitter.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.200]   That's another good one.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.640]   But first, let's talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix and a product that you
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:24.480]   probably have used, if not you ought to use it, called Go to Meeting.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.840]   It's been around for I think 10 years now and has become by far the dominant online
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.880]   meeting software for good reason.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.680]   They just make it better all the time.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.520]   Go to Meeting allows you to share screens.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.360]   Of course, it's done that for years.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.960]   And now you can see each other face to face with HD faces, crystal clear video.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.280]   So now you're on the same page with your team.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.360]   Nobody likes meetings.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.000]   But if you've got a meeting and you do have to meet, I think it's the only way to really
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.960]   cut through the clutter.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.000]   We often, in fact, Lisa has a great rule.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.240]   If five emails go back and forth on the topic, that's it.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.240]   We're meeting, right?
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.600]   There's the only way to cut through this.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   Otherwise, it just goes on endlessly.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.320]   But if you're going to have a meeting, you want to make it efficient.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.200]   You want to make it effective and go to meeting really does.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.640]   You can share the screen, be on the same page, see each other.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.160]   It's great for team building, for solving problems, for making it work.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.640]   You get a built-in, of course, a fridge, phone bridge.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.000]   But you can also use the built-in audio and video on your computer, your laptop, or your
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   iPad.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.520]   You know, you could present from your iPad, which is a lot of fun if you're out in your
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.080]   backyard and enjoying life.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   You want to have a meeting?
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.080]   You still can.

[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   Jerry, you're an iPhone.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.520]   Did you get the iPhone 5S?
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   I haven't yet.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:02.800]   I'm still 4G and I'm about to upgrade to something else.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.960]   Tell me what I ought to get.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.760]   Well, you know, they have two new models.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.680]   They have the 5C, the colorful model.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.680]   I've started C ads.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:14.120]   I just saw ads in the NFL this morning, which they say the C is for colorful characters
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.120]   and they have all these kind of wacky people.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   I'm cheaper.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.120]   I couldn't care less about that.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.200]   It's basically a 5.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.960]   So what's of interest, I guess, with the new iPhone is the fingerprint scanner.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   That's the really.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.560]   It's a faster processor.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.760]   It is otherwise identical form factor.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.480]   You can now get it in gold as well as space gray and white.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.280]   And we mentioned the flash and the camera.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.920]   But the fingerprint reader is the big thing.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.720]   And it does work well.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.320]   Here, I'll show you.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.920]   So when I turn on, what did I do?
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.600]   I turn on my phone and I just put my fingerprint on it.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.640]   You can, of course, slide to unlock and enter in a passcode.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.920]   But if you put your fingerprint on there and unlocks it, you can do that to buy a fingerprint
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.160]   by apps on the app store or by music on iTunes.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   And it works quite well.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:07.240]   I'm waiting to see how long before Apple releases an API for third parties to do this.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.600]   Because that could make it very interesting, right?
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.080]   Very, very.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.640]   We don't know how reliable it is.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.760]   Apple is apparently, I talked to a security expert when I was in Turkey, Jamal.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.120]   And he said, Apple uses nine points of similarity.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.560]   So what that means is it's very quick to register a fingerprint.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.400]   And it's very reliable.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.240]   But it also means there are more collisions.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.640]   So there's false positives or false positives.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.400]   But that's probably going to be one out of 50,000 people or something.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.400]   How did you know?
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   That's exactly the number.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   I really just pulled that out of the area.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   That is scary.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.400]   How about that?
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.400]   That is exactly right.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.280]   You have to be very cunning, thief to look at your fingers, they're stealing your iPhones.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.160]   Oh, yeah, there's a guy in my gang who's got that world.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.160]   It seems unlikely.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.160]   It seems really unlikely.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:52.800]   What I want them to do is to take the fingerprint of the guy who stole my phone as he's trying
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.040]   to turn it on and zap that off.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.040]   They can't do that.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.040]   Pretty clever.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.080]   And in fact, the reason they don't do that is because people were a little bit concerned
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.480]   privacy-wise that Apple might be storing fingerprints.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.480]   They don't.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.480]   They take it locally.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.480]   It's sort of a way.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.120]   But not even the fingerprint, not an image, but a hash.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.640]   So they take, they look at the fingerprint, you do it a few times to register the fingerprint.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.000]   They hash that.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.600]   And that way, when you do it again, it will generate a similar hash.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.800]   If it's close enough, they say, okay, that's a match.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.640]   Well, that certainly got to be more secure than a four-digit number.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   I would guess so.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.680]   I mean, there were only 10,000-
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.680]   There were only 10,000-
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   There were only 10,000-
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   Which is half of all people.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.680]   Don't even bother.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.680]   That's what Apple said, right?
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   No, half of all people don't.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   It's like an automatic, it's like an airbag.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   It's like, you know, half of people weren't using seat belts anyway.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.360]   Maybe they're not that much better than a seat belt.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.920]   But for those who, it really protects those who aren't actually using the protection.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.480]   What I wonder, Leo, I've tested it and it worked fine.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.080]   I don't have an iPhone 5S at the moment.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:49.760]   But do you find yourself allowing it to lock more automatically more often?
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.160]   For example, on my phone, I just have it locked every hour or two because it's such a hassle.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.160]   Oh, no.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.160]   No, I want it to lock all the time.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.160]   Lock right away.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.160]   You get it from the phone.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   Unlock now, yes.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.160]   I just put my finger on.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.160]   Probably the biggest deal.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.160]   The fact that you're keeping it locked all the time.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.160]   Yep, that's the one.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.000]   It'll be more important than the fact that it's fingerprint.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Absolutely.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   It's like the airbag.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   It's just always on and it's friction-free.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.160]   You don't have to think about it at all.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.160]   That's the reason.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.160]   I hope the new iPads have that too.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.880]   Because they've got a program coming up, right?
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.880]   Well, that's okay.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.080]   Let's move on to that.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.120]   We don't know for sure.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:25.640]   Yeah, I'm very interested in iPads because my 14-year-old granddaughter, her parents,
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:31.080]   have finally decided that she can have an iPad and I want to buy one for Christmas.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.240]   So I want to know exactly what together is the right one to get her.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.120]   Well, we don't know, of course.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:41.440]   John Petchkowski of all things digital who seems to have pretty good connections with
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.800]   Apple has said and most people agree that it will be the 22nd.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   It was the 23rd last year.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.840]   I think we can pretty safely say it will be new iPads.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.960]   There is some question about whether they'll do a new mini and if they do, whether there
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.520]   be new retina mini.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.520]   Presumably.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.320]   Well, apparently it's technically difficult.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.320]   Okay.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.320]   Well, not presumably.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.280]   Well, I mean, that's the question.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.880]   The issue is battery life.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.360]   You put a lot of pixels on that screen.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.040]   It gets hard to get you the 10 hours that Apple wants.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.160]   Well, it'll have an A7 chip, presumably the new line.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:23.760]   Without the fingerprint scanner, it's hard to think of what they could add to an iPad
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   on October 22nd or 23rd.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   That would really be that revolutionary.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.760]   There's not a whole lot.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:37.360]   If you have a fourth generation iPad, better camera maybe, maybe more memory.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.560]   I don't think anybody's going to, Apple doesn't even talk about the memory.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.560]   I mean, more storage.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.560]   More storage.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.560]   Yeah, more storage.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.160]   I mean, the thing about here's a little thing that bugs me a little.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.160]   I mean, there's a long term option.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:51.560]   You have to be under 28 gigs and well, 128 is the top top and now maybe they go.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.760]   Yeah, we're two fifty six.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.960]   64, 128, 256 or something like that.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:01.400]   But I mean, without the fingerprint authentication, it's hard to think of anything that they
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.680]   could do with a new line of iPads that would have people stampeding.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.360]   Now, they could do the thing that intrigues me about the five C.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   By the way, that's a problem Apple has in general.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.360]   The stampede.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.360]   It's just you've got a very mature product that kind of does everything.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.160]   It's like the Microsoft Word problem.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.160]   And into the phone better.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.760]   Well, this is exactly what they did.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.560]   You remember the iPod mini 2004.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.960]   They kind of done everything you'd think they could do with an iPod.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.760]   This was before the touch, which did revolutionize everything.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.360]   That was kind of an iPhone.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.360]   They came out with them in different colors.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.360]   That was it.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:36.560]   So the iPod iPod mini came out, I think, in blue and silver and pink as well, like
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.560]   five C.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.240]   And just the mere perfusion, the existence of colors, really excited the market.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.400]   And from what we've been seeing this week, there was a survey that was done that said
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:50.640]   not only is the five S outselling every other phone with all of the carriers, so is the
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   five C.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   I didn't think anybody was buying the five C, but apparently it's moving.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.440]   And people like their colors.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.200]   So maybe the iPad will come out in lots of cool colors.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.200]   Okay.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.640]   I mean, that wouldn't get me stampede on the store, but the market they're going after
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   with these colors.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.840]   I mean, I agree with Jerry.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.800]   I could care less for someone to put a case on anyway.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:13.880]   But for reasons that don't make a lot of sense for me, people love colors.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   But when you think about cars, I mean, people spend extra money or go way out of their way
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.840]   to order a car and the color they love.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.560]   So why not a phone?
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.800]   Well, I think to answer your question, Jerry, the one to look at and see what happens if
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.360]   it's October 22nd, the one to watch is the iPad mini.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:35.440]   I think for most people, that's actually better than the 9.7 inch, especially the only thing
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:38.000]   lacking on the mini last year was the retina display.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   They could put a retina display on a mini.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.760]   I think that's the sweet spot.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.600]   And I think sales figures have held that have shown that that's the one people want.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   The mini is.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.480]   You know, Leo, I have an iPad mini and I've got the new iPad.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:54.360]   I've got tablets with super high res and I don't recall ever looking at my iPad mini
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.400]   and saying, Oh gee, I wish the display were better.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   I did.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   Oh, I did.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   No, no, no.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   But do you use, do you use retin, you use retin, all the time?
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.000]   I've got back and forth, but you know, what I use by mini for is reading and watching
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.440]   movies and I notice it.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:15.480]   I really notice it and it's not, it's not painful, but it's definitely less than optimal.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.080]   I think that's the thing for them to do next.
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.480]   I mean, if they look, they've got, they don't have a lot of room to grow.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.960]   I like the Nexus seven.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.240]   The point of course, the Nexus seven is retina.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:30.080]   It's very high resolution, but it's 25% less screen real estate than an iPad mini would
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   be.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.320]   So that's the issue is do you kill, are you going to kill battery life and give yourself
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.920]   a retin or have they ever or have they solved this?
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.600]   Maybe it'll be something like a turbo button on some cars where you flip on the retin,
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.840]   I was like, I'm turning through the battery because I'm near up.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:50.920]   But I'm thinking your niece, I think in your niece, by the way, Jerry probably does care
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.960]   about color, but I'm thinking that the iPad mini is the right one.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.720]   But watch and see what they do with it.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:02.240]   It's my really bright granddaughter and I would like to get her something good.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.000]   Well, you know, that's the other thing.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.960]   It's very personal between the nine point seven and seven point nine.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.400]   It's not, I like the mini.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.840]   I think it's really good, but not everybody agrees with me.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   So I don't know.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:17.840]   I guess I'll ask her about the size if she prefer the, because she knows pretty well
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:18.840]   what I'm going to get her.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:23.320]   She's going to say I want one of those things that Shep had in his studio.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.320]   He's giant.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.400]   I want giant.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.400]   What is that giant?
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   I want a bat.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.400]   I want a bat.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.720]   Grandpa, give me a bat.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.520]   You know, she might want this new Chromebook.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.720]   Google has announced a new Chromebook.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.880]   This is the HP edition of the Chromebook running.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.120]   Oh my God.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.120]   Are you okay, Larry?
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.120]   I'm okay.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.120]   Like him.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.120]   Oh my God.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.120]   He's over upside down.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   You have one upstairs.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   You have one upstairs.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.120]   You have one upstairs.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   You have one upstairs.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   I can go grab.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.120]   Go ahead.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   You want to go get the Chromebook while I talk about it.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.120]   $2.79.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.960]   This is a new one from HP.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.760]   I think it's 2.3 pounds.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.480]   I'm trying to think if it's has well or not.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.960]   It does come in color.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   Color access.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   Look at that.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   It's kind of pretty.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   The design according to Engadget.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:10.960]   Those are the 5C colors actually.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.440]   Are GB and yellow.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.680]   Well, what they are is the movie.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.680]   They're also the Google colors.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   Right.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.680]   Yeah, that makes the Google sense.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.800]   According to Engadget, the design is screwless.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.240]   Screw free.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:23.160]   I don't know how they do that.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.160]   No vents.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.160]   It is an Exynos.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.320]   That scared me when I saw that spec.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.560]   I think it'd get kind of hot.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   Man.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.560]   Well, you know what?
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.440]   It's not, you know, these things aren't working too hot.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:41.080]   The Exynos is an arm based processor designed actually originally for smartphones.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.720]   Two gigs of RAM, not a lot.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.320]   16 gig SSD.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.240]   YFI up to N. Apparently a 4G option will be available.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:55.480]   But the thing that's I think most interesting about this is that it charges via micro USB.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.480]   Ooh.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.320]   It uses the same charger your phone uses.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   Ooh.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   I know, isn't that odd?
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320]   I want fewer cables.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.320]   I like that.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.320]   Fewer cables.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   You already have the charger.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   I like that.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.320]   That's cool.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.680]   I like the fact that my iPhone and my iPad use the same charging cable.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.680]   More and more.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.680]   I want to see that.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.680]   I'm just going to make sure they're of the same generation.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.680]   So I still have an old iPad.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.320]   And for new iPhones, I've got to carry both.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.320]   So annoying.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.320]   So you like that, Larry?
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.320]   It feels good too.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.000]   I didn't expect to like it, but I actually love it.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   I love the size.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   I like it better than the pixel.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   I like how light it is.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.600]   It's the same weight as the 11 inch MacBook Air except for cost to like $279.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.960]   Well, you could buy five of them for the cost of one pixel.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.960]   So that's good.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.960]   It's fine.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.600]   The screen is adequate.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.520]   And you know, and you know, the reality is sure what I would I take this with me.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.720]   On my trip to Bali, actually I might stick it in my suitcase because it weighs a little
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   bit.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720]   But of course I have to have a real computer.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.520]   So there's no way I'm going to travel without a Mac or a Windows computer.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:01.440]   But for around the house or for people who don't need to run office or other apps, hey,
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.840]   it gets the job done and it does it very well.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.080]   I have switched my position.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.080]   I used to be kind of anti-chrome book and after seeing this and thinking about how cheap
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.360]   it is, I've changed my mind.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.080]   And looking forward to the half old ones that are coming out that actually even have
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.680]   a better battery life.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:16.680]   What are you getting on that?
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.680]   Google says six hours.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.960]   Yeah, I haven't I haven't tested it long enough.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.640]   I mean, it seems to be about six hours.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.560]   I haven't plugged it in in the water.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560]   We are so spoiled now.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.160]   I mean, six hours is a long time ago.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.160]   We're so spoiled.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   This guy I get.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.560]   I got the MacBook 11, the 13.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.560]   Twelve hours.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.000]   Oh, it goes on for days.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   Twelve hours.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   It has changed.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.240]   I hate, you know, this is going to sound really weird because I'm not an Apple fanboy,
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.280]   but it has changed my life more than any technology I've purchased in probably 10 years
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.640]   because I can go to a conference now and I can sit there all day and not worry about
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.200]   having to find a place to plug in.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.480]   I can get on an airplane and fly all the way to Bali for if I want to and not have to plug
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.480]   in.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.480]   And that has really had an impact.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.600]   And that's the only reason I bought it.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   It costs me what?
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.000]   $1,400, but it was worth it for that alone.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.840]   I think what we're seeing, which is nice, is a lot of diversity.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.280]   You have I mean, we haven't had a new OS in ages.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:15.480]   And I think it's pretty exciting and I like seeing the choice.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.040]   I know Chrome OS isn't enough for me.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.120]   I use my Pixel as a as the breakfast computer.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.640]   I sit there and read the news on it.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.320]   That's what I need is something I can read the news on, but that's why I like tablets
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.520]   with one note.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.240]   I could not only read the news, but make the notes for my daily essay.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.760]   But actually, Jerry, you could do that with the Chromebook.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.920]   You might not be able to use one note, but you've actually got a real keyboard.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.920]   So I leave mine in my living room table and I use it when I'm surfing the web when I'm
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   watching TV.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.160]   But if I want to dash off an email, I appreciate the keyboard, which of course the iPad doesn't
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160]   have built into it.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.160]   I agree with you.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.160]   I've used more and more.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.000]   I'm using it as a replacement because of the keyboard.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   But it doesn't.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.400]   But I can't take my photographs and put them in light, remand edit them on it.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400]   It's not designed to do that.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.200]   But it is cheaper than most tablets.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200]   That's what's actually used to.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.640]   You use 79.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.440]   And the new one comes out.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.600]   I just kind of like to give it to you.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.640]   Well, and you got to wonder why the LA school districts spent $30 million on iPads.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.480]   You don't have to wonder about it.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.280]   I guess you don't have to wonder.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.760]   Look at kinship charts.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   And what do they do?
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.120]   They put out a 20-year bond to pay for it.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.320]   Look out for whose brother-in-law is doing what.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.000]   And it will all become clear.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.040]   You're saying that 19 years from now when the iPad is ancient history.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040]   Yeah, there's still be paying for it.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.280]   It might be so pissed off if I were in the LA school district.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.480]   I swear to God.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.040]   And half the price they could get these much more functional, in my opinion, for $20.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:54.160]   They'll tell me what school district you're in that you're not disgusted.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.880]   Well, no, I know.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.880]   I know.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.880]   California in particular.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.080]   But Jerry, it's your fault.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.560]   It's this Jarvis Gantcrap that you, the props are...
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:11.440]   Actually, it goes way back to federal aid to education.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.200]   If you never had that, you wouldn't have these problems.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.680]   I think here in California, where we put a cap on...
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.160]   I don't want to get in politics.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160]   I'll put you in Texas.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160]   Let's stop.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160]   Moving on!
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.640]   We didn't have proposition 13.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.800]   I couldn't live here.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   I know.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   I understand that.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.400]   I know that the seniors were pushed out of houses.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400]   I understand that.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.320]   I paid $30,000 for this house.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.200]   In Jerry, it's worth like a million bucks, but I can't pay them.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.680]   They're taxes on a million bucks.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.680]   No, I understand that.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.680]   I don't make that much money anymore.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.240]   There's got to be a middle ground somewhere.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.280]   I don't know what it is.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.920]   Let's talk about privacy.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.120]   Google has changed their...
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.200]   Well, this is a tale of two privacy policies.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:01.840]   On the one hand, Facebook has decided, "Since you could pretty much find anybody with our
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.800]   social graph search anyway, we're going to turn off that feature that lets you say,
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.360]   'No one can search for me by name.'"
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.440]   In fact, if you have that box checked on your Facebook account that says, "You can't
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.960]   search for me by name," you will get an announcement the next time you go to Facebook that says,
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.760]   "Hey, by the way, we're turning that off."
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.680]   Point there being that, "Well, you could still search for somebody by every other parameter
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.040]   and probably still find them."
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.360]   Nevertheless, I hate to see this.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.560]   I just feel like Facebook doesn't really care about privacy at all.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:36.280]   They don't seem to because I think the vast majority of the users don't particularly care.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:41.120]   We get all up in arms about certain changes in privacy policies and so forth, but when
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.560]   they see less than a ninth of 1% of their users resigning over change, actually change
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.160]   why, they're just not going to worry here.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:56.600]   Except for taking income away from private detectives exactly who is at her.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   Well, here's...
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.400]   I'll give you the one scenario where I feel like this is an issue.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:07.480]   We know if somebody can be found by searching Facebook, then they could be found by paying
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:12.320]   50 bucks to the fly by a non-detective agency for God's sake.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.320]   Right.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.320]   Right.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.280]   I guess, and that's Facebook's point of view, is you're not...
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.080]   It's an illusion that you're hiding anything by saying, checking that box.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.080]   But I'll give you an example.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.520]   But when I was traveling, my mom said, "Well, how can I see your pictures?"
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.280]   I said, "Well, they're all on Facebook."
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.600]   And she said, "Well, I don't want a Facebook account because I don't want old high school
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.760]   sweethearts to be looking me up."
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760]   And it's really hard.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.520]   I tried to create a Facebook account for her where she could be anonymous, but it's very
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.680]   hard to do that.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:44.200]   And so there's the scenario where somebody says, "Well, all of my grandkids and kids are
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.080]   on Facebook and I want to see those pictures, but I don't want to have a presence on Facebook.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.880]   It's very hard to do that."
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.920]   So what I did is I just made my profile 100% public.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.560]   And mom, just go to LeoChieleport and you can see everything.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   All the fake cases.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.600]   I think the issue is people really need to know that they can control who can see what
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   they post.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.680]   And the key to any privacy at all on Facebook is to know that when you post something right
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:11.280]   below the update box, the little icon, in my case, it's almost all public because I
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.280]   want to post in the...
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280]   Right.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.400]   And I want to share it with a limited audience so I can do that.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.440]   And you've got to learn to do that if it matters because I think Facebook is right, that
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.840]   they can have search or no search.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:26.080]   There are a million ways to find you, including your friends linking to, including your friends
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.640]   sharing what you post.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.240]   And so it was a false sense of security.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.720]   Now I'm not saying they should have deleted it, but I really don't think it's a big deal.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.040]   Also as they point out, they've already actually already had deleted it for a lot of users
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.920]   anyway who weren't using it.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.520]   They just told us about it now.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.400]   Yeah, you make an excellent point.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.920]   And I think that that is Facebook's answer, which is, well, you could do it post by post
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.640]   and so you should just do that.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.000]   But that's a lot of work.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   Well, it's more work.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.720]   And what I don't like about that feature, frankly, is so I like to post publicly 90%
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.720]   of the time.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   But once in a while I'll post privately.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.640]   And then the next time I post, it's automatically set up for private and I have to remember
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.640]   to go public.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640]   Right.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   It's a little siddly.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.280]   So, and the real danger is if you want to be private and you say, okay, I'm going to post
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.160]   this public because I want to.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.360]   And then you go back and you think you're posting privately, but you're posting publicly
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.440]   and so you really have to watch it.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   It's sticky.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.200]   Every time you change it, it stays in that position until you change it again.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:25.160]   Now there is one privacy setting that I really, I consider important just personally, which
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.040]   is I don't, I want to turn off sponsored ads.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:36.800]   I don't want an advertiser to use my name and image in an ad to my friends.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.800]   Right.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.200]   Which Google is now going to enable.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.000]   Well, and we're going to talk about that in a second.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.680]   Let me ask, because I've seen different things as I thought I'd turn that off, but some have
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.840]   said you can't turn that off.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:54.360]   I just don't ever click like on any product or anything because for precisely that reason.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:09:00.000]   Anytime you like something, it drives me away from the activity that they're trying
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.680]   to encourage, I assume, because their sponsors are going to like it, of ever clicking like
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.760]   on a brand that I'm interested in because I'm going to suddenly be shilling it to, you
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.040]   know, all of my friends or even worse, my Facebook friends include people that I don't
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040]   know that well.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.280]   You know, I can hear what Facebook says.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.920]   Way to way to my own roommate, but everyone wants to know what their friends like.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.560]   That's why we pair ads and friends.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.560]   An easy way to find products and services you're interested in based on what your friends
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.560]   share.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:31.880]   Now, when I try to edit this, I say pair my social actions with ads for no one, but I've
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.280]   been told and I've seen written that that doesn't change your presence and sponsored
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   stories.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.840]   So I don't, I'm not sure if that does anything or not.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.760]   But anyway, just a point.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   You should do that.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.760]   Yes.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.360]   You and I and Dvorak and some others like that.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.600]   The one thing we kind of have to sell is the integrity of our opinions.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.600]   Exactly.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.800]   And that's why for me, this is a personal issue.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800]   That's scary.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:05.080]   And that they start saying because you kind of like something, it makes it look like you're
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.920]   endorsing it is exactly what I don't want in my case.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.880]   For me, it's actually could be I could theoretically lose my job.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.720]   So for example, I had strong opinions on California proposition a few years ago.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.880]   I shared it with my friends.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.160]   But if I had publicly endorsed one side or the other, I'm violating one of the rules
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.120]   of of of CBS news is that I cannot take a public position on a political campaign.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.320]   And that doesn't mean I can't vote or talk to my friends about it.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.240]   But suddenly liking something means that I'm endorsing it.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.840]   And that's theoretically could get me fired.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.960]   Well, Google obviously has been looking at the revenue Facebook's making on this and said,
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.600]   Hey, we'd like some of that money too.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.240]   So Google has now Google's done it a little differently.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240]   And I kind of like this.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.920]   First of all, unlike Facebook, they've announced it before they've made the change.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.360]   They've actually pre announced it so that you have a chance to read about it, hear about
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.720]   it on this show, whatever.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.200]   And they did pop ups when you hit the Google site too.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.080]   I had a little pop up windows at the very, very top that were made it very plain that
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.080]   they're making this change.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.200]   They were communicating it, which I think is good.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.960]   And there's an opt out.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:12.680]   So the idea is just like Facebook, Google will soon be able to show users names, photos,
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.080]   ratings and comments in abs, not just on Google.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.920]   Now this is one thing that's a little different, but across the web.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:19.920]   But this is beacony.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:20.920]   Yeah, beacon-ish.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.000]   That's what Facebook got in trouble for doing beacon.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.360]   So these ads, you know, the Facebook stuff shows up on Facebook when your friends go
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.760]   to some date.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.760]   It's all internal.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.840]   These ads would show up in Google ads everywhere, which is a real concern.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.880]   I mean, now you can opt out, at least for now.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.440]   Well, you have to opt out.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.760]   And by the way, if you go to marithorold.com or safekids.com, there's an article, actually
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.560]   it's the second article now, which links to where you can opt out.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.840]   And you can, and you should if you don't want to be shield and advertisements.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.280]   And people under the age of 18 will automatically be excluded, by the way.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.960]   This really sounds like a matter for concern for organizations like the authors guild and
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.680]   the science fiction writers of America.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.640]   Because if it can make it look like you're endorsing a product, when all you did was
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.000]   say, yeah, I like that.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.360]   It's all right, or I've used it.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.520]   That is actually interfering with a commercial right you have.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.840]   Authors get paid money to endorse products for God's sakes.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:31.920]   Now I have not done it myself because when I was writing for bite, obviously that would
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.640]   have been an inappropriate thing to do.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:40.000]   But many authors are paid money to endorse a product back in the cigarette days.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.600]   Lots of them were all my money comes from all of it.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.280]   Every penny of it.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:49.080]   So and this is this seems like theft to me.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.440]   Well, I always turned off.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:59.240]   I mean, don't we have a constitutional right to keep our opinions, to not have them used
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.800]   in somebody else's ad?
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.560]   I'd love to see this in a courtroom.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.080]   So if you want to tell me, you're probably welcome to me and say, hey, Larry, I really
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080]   like the Macintosh.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.920]   I could go tell all my friends, Jerry Prane, I like the Macintosh because you told me we
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.480]   weren't under NDA.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.960]   But again, if Apple used that in an ad, then they would have to get permission and probably
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   compensate you.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   Right.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.440]   And you could quote an article you wrote.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.040]   Yeah, but that's fair use.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.720]   And they're not doing that here.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.720]   So I don't know.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:32.800]   If you want to know more plus Google dot com slash settings slash endorsements, it is
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.720]   opt in opt out.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.400]   You are opted in automatically.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.960]   In fact, you see here, I see the checkbox based on my activity.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.840]   Google may show my name and profile photo and shared endorsements appear in ads.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.640]   And I'm just going to uncheck that and I'm going to save it.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.640]   And now they can't do it.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.040]   You disabled this setting.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.440]   Whoa, are you sure your friends will be less likely to benefit from your recommendations?
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.440]   So Orwellian.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.440]   Double speak, man.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.600]   I mean, that is.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.400]   Are you sure you come on?
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.720]   Your friends not going to be happy about this.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.560]   Assuming your friends are Google shareholders, you're undermining them.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.960]   Your friends, Larry and Sergey are going to be very upset and we're going to tell them.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:19.200]   Are you going to go on a special list?
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.560]   You've been knocked off of Larry's whitelist for email.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.200]   He'll never respond to another one.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.240]   But on the other hand, Google was in trouble for cookies and a federal judge.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.640]   I'm pleased to say in Delaware this week dismissed a class action lawsuit against Google
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:39.880]   and two other tech companies saying that setting a cookie on your browser is not in fact tracking
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:40.880]   you.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.880]   Apple and Microsoft were also.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.600]   What this comes from the Google kind of sneaky thing they did on the iPhone where they went
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.320]   around Safari's policy for third party cookies.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.880]   There was a class action suit.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:01.080]   The judge said companies had circumvented that the companies had circumvented browser
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.440]   settings allowing browser users personal information to be sold to ad companies.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:12.600]   But plaintiffs cannot show they suffered because the companies collected and sold the information.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.000]   Now that I read this, I may not be too happy about this.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.680]   Well, it's a very classic legal decision.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.240]   You have to have some consequence.
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.240]   Can't show what the damage is.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.240]   Yes.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.880]   They're not saying it's a good thing to do or that they have a constitutional right to
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.880]   doing it.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.880]   They're saying that in this suit at least you can't show that you have been damaged and
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.320]   thus we have nothing to decide.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.680]   That's a different thing from endorsing the fact that Google does it.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:46.640]   By the way, most of you like me periodically erase all unprotected cookies.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.640]   Sure.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:55.040]   I mean, I have an editor that basically lets me protect certain cookies that I want to
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.200]   keep there.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.440]   I just every day or so go through and say erase all unprotected cookies.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440]   Right.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.760]   It's too much of a pain because then I have to re-log in and all that stuff.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.240]   I don't want to get the problem.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.920]   Well, he has, he said he had an editor which lets him say, yeah, keep my New York Times
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:11.920]   cookie.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.920]   Keep that.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.920]   That's a pain in the ass.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920]   You got to go through one by one.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.480]   But you probably want to have any that I want to keep.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.960]   We've had a series of moral panics, right?
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.280]   First it was predators and it's privacy and it's security.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.520]   And yeah, there are issues.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.200]   I think that we have a right to privacy, but there is this notion out there that everything
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:37.480]   that monetizes information about people is somehow violating our personal privacy.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.440]   And while I don't want my name associated with where I surf on the web or what I buy,
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.280]   and yeah, I get creeped out sometimes when I have to look at an ad based on my surfing
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.560]   habits, I also recognize the fact that billions of dollars are spent every year on these services
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.120]   and I don't want to have to pay a dollar per Google search.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.000]   I don't want to have to pay for Gmail like I used to pay for MCI mail.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.320]   And I'm willing to make that trade off as long as, and this is the big question, as long
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.400]   as there are reasonable privacy procedures in place, as long as the government isn't
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.480]   necessarily dipping into those databases, which in fact they are.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.920]   But the reality is that this is the world we live in and I do think we have to analyze
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.440]   whether there's risk and whether there's harm.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.880]   And just because it's possible that our privacy is being violated doesn't necessarily mean
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.160]   that it is.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.360]   But again, we're getting a lot of benefit out of these services.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:32.400]   And I'm not a Google stockholder, but I do have some concern about this sort of overreaction
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.680]   to what I call privacy panic.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.200]   No, I'm with you on that.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.800]   And I think that's the key is to find a balance.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.280]   They've been a lot of great, though, aren't we?
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.280]   I think we're all agreed on that.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.320]   On the other hand, I will argue with you on one thing, Larry.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.760]   I really wish that I had to pay a penny every time I sent an email on the condition that
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.320]   anybody else who did also had to.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:58.360]   But you remember when you were 50 cents or even a tenth of a cent would do right.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.360]   Any period.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.080]   It was 50 cents back in the days of MCA.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.080]   I mean, and I did it.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.920]   It was actually more expensive than a U.S.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.560]   Posey sense to send an email.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:12.240]   I would rather pay a penny per email than to have to work.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.120]   I've got an elaborate system of rules and spam filters.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.600]   And it still isn't enough.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.600]   No.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:26.000]   If I'm on the road and if God knows if I'm connected with through to dial up Lord in
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.240]   heaven, it takes an hour to download my mail.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.280]   Do you use Gmail?
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:39.920]   I know I use I use outlook and but the problem is, Posey takes care of an awful lot of it
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.200]   at the servo level, but they still get through a good bit of it.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:48.120]   Now it gets taken off into into the junk mail folder.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:55.560]   I never see it, but it takes a long time for it to come in if I'm on a slow connection.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.480]   I got to say I really like the new Gmail.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.800]   First of all, Gmail eliminates spam pretty effectively.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   Pretty effectively.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.080]   Yeah, I get very little and I and Gmail and then there's some real debate over this, but
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.840]   the gmails added these new inbox automatic filtering.
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.480]   With primary they have up to I think five different folders, primary, social, you could
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.640]   turn them on and off.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:23.080]   Promotions, updates and forums and then there's automatically server level or your level.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   Server level.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080]   Okay.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.800]   And they automatically do this and you can correct it.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.920]   You can drag if something goes into social and should be in primary, you drag it over
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.600]   or vice versa.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.640]   And I found it to be surprisingly accurate right out of the box and stuff that ends
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.240]   up in primary is pretty much from real people that I want to hear from.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.640]   And I'm not surprised that they given how good they are at spam.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.160]   I'm not surprised that they got that right.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.720]   As soon as that thing launched, I looked at it and horror.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.680]   I'm like one inbox is killing me as it is.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.920]   Now I'm going to have five.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   Are you not?
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.920]   So I turned it right off.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920]   I didn't really turn it on.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920]   I'll give it a shot.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.920]   I'll give it a shot.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.160]   I was using these and by the way, I was in a band with very highly bandwidth constrained
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.720]   environment on a cruise ship.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:06.280]   So that man, I could check mail once I was doing it on a smartphone using the Gmail app,
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.800]   which reflects these and it actually worked.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.480]   It did a great triage and allowed me to get the mail.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.360]   I really wanted and not have to worry about the mailing lists I'd subscribed to four years
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   ago and keep forgetting.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.080]   My problem with Gmail spam filters is false positive.
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:24.440]   Every once in a while, I'll look at my trash box and my spam box and there will be emails
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.880]   that are legitimate that I actually wish I had gotten.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.880]   Exactly.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:28.880]   Really.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880]   I'm never.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.880]   Well, not too often, but once in a while.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.880]   Enough.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:40.640]   And every spam filter I've ever had has managed to get me to put off stuff from people who
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:46.400]   are legitimate subscribers who paid money to subscribe to my site and they're sending
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.960]   me a message using some code words even in it.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.120]   And somehow or another got pushed off into.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.680]   Well, it could be the spam.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:58.240]   I find it and I bring it back, but that takes time too.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.600]   And I accidentally ignore some of it.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.600]   Some of it's PR mail, which is legitimate.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.160]   It's not spam, but it may be using some kind of a list manager.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.600]   And so they think it's spam.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:08.600]   Sometimes it has writing.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.760]   And you have to get the press releases.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.760]   Absolutely.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.000]   I'm looking at my spam box and it looks pretty good.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.160]   It looks like a bunch of crap.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.360]   And I don't see the good offer.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:41.600]   I have been so happy I have not looked at this ever.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.920]   Is that a female?
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.920]   This is my Gmail spam.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.400]   And it seems like a pretty good, it's doing a pretty good job.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:51.760]   I was recently, until very recently using a third party server side spam filtering that
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:52.760]   was really, really good.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.760]   It was one of our advertisers.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.400]   And I, with trepidation, turned it off.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.480]   I wanted to see how Gmail did.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.240]   And I didn't notice any increase in spam.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.840]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:07.960]   I just looking at mine, Intuit sent me a notice by federal income tax return with rejected.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   Now, that's a pretty important point.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.160]   Boy, I'd like to see that.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.320]   That was in your spam box.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.480]   Well, can I show it here?
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.480]   Is it true?
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.480]   No.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.480]   Well, with rejected, but it means it was a technical area.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.480]   This email came from Nigeria.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.480]   So, like, right there.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.480]   Please put it here.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.680]   Social security number to get your, yeah.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.680]   My sandbox.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.680]   And that's just an important piece of mess.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.680]   That's an piece of mail.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:26.680]   You need to correct that.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.680]   No, I corrected.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.880]   On the other hand, those emails from the Democrats, just throw those out.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:30.880]   Okay.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.880]   All right.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:32.880]   Let's take a break.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.880]   Come back.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:34.880]   We got more.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.880]   Niners are winning.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.680]   The world, Leo Laport with the great Jerry Pournell.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.360]   He is the author of some of the best books ever written and continues to write great
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360]   stuff.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:48.440]   JerryPournell.com, the real inspiration for my career because Chaos Manor was the first
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:52.240]   time I'd ever read any stuff that was written from the point of view of the user.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.440]   And I said, yes, we can represent the user.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.160]   And that's, and he's still a legend.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.800]   And I'm one of my heroes.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.760]   Great to have you, Rob Reed, the author of year one now, 99 cents.
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:03.760]   You're zero.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.760]   You're zero.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.560]   You're zero is the 99 cent one.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:14.320]   And as a rip and read, funny, provocative, and it's great sci-fi, year zero on Amazon
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.720]   99 cents on the Kindle version right now.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:20.520]   And Larry Magad, what is the latest site we should be using?
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.360]   Oh, you can go to safekids.com.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.360]   You can go to larrytheworld.com with a nonprofit, kiddick-safely.org.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.800]   But larrytheworld.com is kind of a gateway to everything.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800]   It's got everything.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.800]   Okay.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:31.800]   And of course you hear him regularly on CBS Radio.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.680]   And you just celebrated a big anniversary.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:35.680]   30 years as a tech.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.840]   Well, I've been writing a Jerry course predates me by quite a while.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.840]   But I've been writing--
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.840]   You weren't even born when Jerry started writing about this.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.840]   Oh, that's not true.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.640]   I tell, you know, half the people who write today weren't born when I started writing the
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.360]   LA Times column.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360]   And I started in '83.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:55.720]   And I noticed it in January '84, I did a 1984 column about Big Brother watching you
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:59.400]   and the concern about the government looking at your email.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.840]   And I realized that Snowden was five months old.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:03.840]   Oh, wow.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.640]   And he later showed us all that it was absolutely true, unfortunately.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   But no, it's fine.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.600]   If you go to Larry's World and you'll see the 30-year column, there's also a yellowed
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.200]   clipping of my first LA Times column, which is called "Learn Buzzwords Before Shopping,"
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:22.360]   where I told people what a disc was and ram and ram and a kilobyte is because these were
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.920]   foreign words back then.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.320]   Maybe again, foreign words.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.520]   Well, congratulations on 30 years.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520]   There it is.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.520]   Cool.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.760]   I think we're roughly-- I don't know what my anniversary is, but we're roughly the same.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   Could be.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.920]   Jerry, how many years-- when did you start writing about tech?
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.800]   I think my first byte column was in '79.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.800]   Wow.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:42.800]   Wow.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.800]   You beat me.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.120]   It actually wasn't a column then.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.360]   It was an article on writing with computers, and they liked it so much.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.120]   They said, "Why don't you do this regularly?"
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.320]   But I didn't have a contract.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:25:03.720]   I was just sending them in until PC World went from monthly to biweekly.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:10.520]   Peter Norton was writing their column, and he didn't want to write two columns a month.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.160]   He said, "Why don't we alternate?"
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:18.360]   So I told my, "How would you like it if I wrote column for you and also won for your
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.360]   biggest rival?"
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.000]   They said, "We'd hate that."
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.440]   I said, "But they're paying me more than you are."
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.040]   They said, "We'll fix that."
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.360]   They doubled what they were paying me, so everything went well from there.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.160]   Do you think writing on a computer will ever catch on, or was it just a fan of the time?
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.800]   Well, there was quite a conversation in those days about it, because after all, it was using
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.960]   like electric pencil, and you had to hit line feed at the end of each line, and only 64
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.600]   characters to a line.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:57.720]   Even so, my productivity went up from one novel every two years to about three years.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:04.520]   I think that when I went from an IBM Selectric to an Apple II, my productivity skyrocketed,
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.080]   and it hasn't skyrocketed since it's been no other--
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.360]   Addressing envelopes has gotten so much harder.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:14.000]   Well, I've kept the Selectric typewriter for addressing the envelopes.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.080]   You keep it, that's right.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.080]   It's worth saying.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.080]   I had a label printer for that.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.080]   I would feel--
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.080]   I would feel to have a Selectric.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:24.080]   Have you had a device since then that has given you that big a productivity boost in one
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.480]   upgrade from device that you're using today to a new one?
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.320]   Have you had anything that's even come close to that jump?
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:40.960]   Yeah, software going from a CPM thing to Q&A right in DOS probably had another big big
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.120]   that was a great program.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.960]   I learned about that from you.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.520]   Q&A was wonderful program.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:52.280]   It had an AI in it that let you do all kinds of programming and response and stuff, and
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.680]   the editor was just great.
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.840]   Who was it that wrote that?
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.840]   Well, Commander Yubanks was--
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:01.840]   Oh, yeah, you're new.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.480]   Gordon Yubanks who later went on to run Symantec, but that was a--
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.480]   Yeah, this is our Symantec product.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.280]   I think it was one of their first big products.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.280]   1985.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.800]   Jerry, you remember the word "star diamond" where you would do control R to go up and
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.400]   control C to go down?
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.760]   I still use that interface with Microsoft Word.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:23.040]   I've never gotten away from that because it is much more efficient than using arrow
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.080]   keys or mice or any other way to quickly get from one part of the screen to another.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.080]   But that's just--
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.480]   Yeah, I was that way for a while, but I haven't any more for a long time.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.120]   Have you talked to Gordon Yubanks lately?
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.320]   He's still around, I think.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320]   Is he?
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.920]   I haven't seen him for several years.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.720]   He was a great guy.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.880]   He was an instructor at the Navy Postgraduate School in Monterey.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880]   That's where he met--
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.880]   He met Gary Killdall.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   Yeah, Gary Killdall.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.880]   They were both good friends.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.120]   My son is a graduate of that.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:03.880]   When he was a lieutenant commander or maybe lieutenant, he went to that school.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.760]   Now I've known Yubanks a long time.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.520]   But I haven't seen him in some years.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:15.680]   I lost track of a lot of people when I got my brain burned out for the cancer--
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.840]   Was he in that part of your brain?
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:25.040]   No, but my ability to change the subject fast kind of--
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.880]   I think you're still doing pretty good.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   You're doing great, Gary.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.880]   Kid?
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.480]   I haven't a hard time keeping you on track.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.080]   Well, that could be old, actually.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.080]   We've digressed--
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.080]   No, no, no.
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.080]   We've digressed a lot.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.080]   I mean, Jerry's like that.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.080]   No, are you kidding?
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.080]   No, you're doing great.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.080]   Oh.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.080]   Holy cow.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.720]   But I know for a period of time-- and we used to talk to you during that period.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.720]   I know it was tough.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.760]   But you've done-- ever since you've come-- it's been 100% recovery, has it not?
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.760]   Pretty well.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.000]   The only thing that hasn't come back is balance.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.680]   I have to carry a cane, but I'm not frail.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.040]   I just simply have to have a reference point.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.440]   Well, and we love having you on.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.920]   And it's great to see you again.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:07.360]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.800]   We think there's a new iPad coming.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.640]   Now would be a great time to get a quote on your old iPad at gazelle.com.
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.640]   And I'll tell you why.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:20.040]   The minute they announce the new iPad, your current iPad value just plummets.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:21.720]   But it hasn't happened yet.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:27.000]   And the beauty of this is you can go to gazelle.com, get a quote for your iPad.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.120]   And it's good for 30 days.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.000]   So here's-- you're going to get a quote.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.200]   And even if the value of your iPad doesn't-- goes down after the new one's announced,
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:43.400]   you still can say, hey, no, no, you promised me, in this case, $335 for my fourth generation
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.960]   Apple iPad.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.960]   What happens now?
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.280]   Get this quote now.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.880]   Add this to your cart.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.840]   Get a quote on every piece of old technology you got lying around.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:30:00.200]   They'll buy iPhones, cell phones from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, HTC LG, Motorola, even
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.320]   old Nokia phones.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:05.080]   They'll buy tablets from Apple, Amazon, Asus, you know what?
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.680]   This is a good time to get a quote on your old surface.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:10.720]   If you're going to get the new surface, get a quote on the Surface Pro.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:13.680]   So you see what you can get in return for that.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:19.600]   Get an offer on my 64-- that's what I have, a 64 gig in good condition, power supply,
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.240]   touch cover, yes, yes.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:25.120]   And the value of that-- hey, that's good.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.480]   That's going to give me a good way toward my new surface.
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:29.800]   So what you do is you get these quotes.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.200]   Then when you want to pull the trigger, and it could be like a month from now, 29 days
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:36.600]   later, you say, OK, and they'll send you the box with the mailing.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:40.560]   They pay the mailing on anything over more than a buck.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.240]   And then they'll send you a check.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:45.320]   You can get a PayPal coupon or a little pro tip here.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.440]   If you get the Amazon gift card, they'll bump it up another 5%.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.920]   They buy old Macs, MacBooks.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:57.640]   They buy Apple TVs, old cinema displays, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.680]   It's the best way to recycle.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:03.840]   Put some cash in your pocket, sell it to somebody who wants your old stuff, gazelle.com.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.560]   Just had a curiosity, I asked them.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:12.120]   They said, we've paid $100 million to over 600,000 customers in the last couple of years.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:18.560]   No wonder, gazelle.com, really great people with a great product.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:21.480]   Moving along, we were talking about this Twitter story.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.480]   We were.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.240]   I cannot wait to read Nutt-Bilton's book about the history of Twitter.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.160]   It was excerpted in the New York Times.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.720]   Now you're an entrepreneur.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.040]   You've been through this probably a few times.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:37.080]   Were you surprised, Robert, by anything that you read in here?
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:42.560]   No, it seems like there were a lot more sharp elders around there.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.160]   It's pretty brutal.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:48.920]   I never experienced anything like that myself, but shocked that it could happen.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.920]   No.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.040]   For instance, Jack Dorsey, who was one of the people who came up with Twitter, along with
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.640]   Noah Glass.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:00.800]   Both of them were at Odeo, which was Evan Williams' podcast company.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.000]   I remember Odeo very well because we were at podcasting at the time.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.920]   Odeo was one of the way that it's distributed, but much like Rhapsody, iTunes came along.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.560]   That's the end of the line for Odeo.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.920]   To his credit, Ev gave back the money to the investors.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.920]   I liked that.
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.800]   Before even that happened, he started casting around for a new product.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:24.160]   Jack and Noah said, "Hey, we got this idea for a text messaging service."
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.080]   Noah was the one who came up with a name Twitter.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.400]   Apparently, the story is told in this book.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.280]   He went through the dictionary.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.520]   Looking for a pro word.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:33.720]   Tea words.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.680]   The reason he came up with Twitter is because...
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.680]   Phrenetic or something like that.
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.000]   He was initially...
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   Well, initially...
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   Okay.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.520]   So, Williams said, "We'll call it Friendstalker."
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:52.840]   Which is a good name, but probably not gonna be creepy.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:56.680]   So Glass, according to Nick Bilton writes, "Glass became obsessive, flipping through a
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:00.640]   physical dictionary, almost word by word looking for the right name.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.080]   One late afternoon, alone in his apartment, he reached over to his cell phone and turned
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.400]   it to silent.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.760]   And then as usual, it started to vibrate.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:10.960]   He quickly considered the name "vibrate."
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:14.040]   Next to that, tried Twitch.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.040]   Not right.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040]   So the...
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.040]   Well, we're in the TWs.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.040]   Let's try Twitch.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.040]   Get close.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.040]   Try Twitch.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:23.000]   God, I'm glad he didn't pick Twitch.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.640]   Now by the way, I wanna point out that this is a guy running a podcast company.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.280]   I'm really well-knew that there was probably his number one podcast was called "Twit."
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:34.120]   I wish he'd kept going past Twitter, but he stopped...
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.120]   You're fine.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.120]   Twitch.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.120]   Twitch.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.120]   Twitter.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.120]   Twitchy and...
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.120]   Twiny?
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.760]   He read the definition, "Light chirping sound made by certain birds."
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:47.480]   He thought agitation or excitement, flutter, Twitter.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.800]   And in fact, that was the name, although originally spelled without vowels.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.800]   T-W-T-T-R.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.800]   Mm.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.560]   'Cause they, I guess, 'cause they couldn't get Twitter.com.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:01.080]   What's interesting though is the revisionist history, particularly from Jack Dorsey, who
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.480]   basically stopped talking about Noah.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.480]   Just wrote his name out of the history.
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:06.480]   Just wrote his style of history.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:10.600]   Just wrote his style according to this article anyway, just sort of erased him from the close
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:11.600]   up shots.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.600]   So...
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.600]   Isn't that weird?
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.600]   It is weird.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.600]   Now here's the thing that's interesting to me.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.200]   So I don't know Jack.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:19.200]   I don't know Jack Dorsey.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.480]   He doesn't even need for a game.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:26.960]   But reading this as somebody who doesn't know anything about him, you cannot like this person
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.960]   that is depicted in this particular excerpt, as depicted there.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:35.080]   You can't feel very good about them being the executive chairman of a company that you
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.920]   may or may not invest in when it goes public in a few short days.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.680]   Well, that's an interesting thing on the timing, isn't it?
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.680]   That's very useful.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:46.680]   So when you get Nick in here, Nick covered Twitter as part of his beat for the New York
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:52.080]   Times, and he's written this story, which there's two sides of every story, we get one
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.160]   of them here.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.480]   And Nick is an outstanding journalist.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.280]   He tells the story very well.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.200]   But Jack won't be able to respond nor will Twitter because they're in the quiet period.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200]   Oh my God.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:07.760]   And so it feels like a pretty, you know, that's a haymaker punch and they cannot respond.
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:12.600]   And so the company is seeking, will be seeking to go public 10 days after this book comes
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.600]   out.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.520]   And there is a series of things in here which would lead anybody, I think, to question the
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:23.760]   character and the sincerity and perhaps even the honesty of the executive chairman of this
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.200]   company that wants to go public on November 15th, and they're muzzled.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:33.840]   And I wonder if this was a business move on Nick's part to, you know, pump up sales or
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:38.200]   I mean, not to not to attack Twitter, but to, you know, expedite the sale of his book,
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:41.160]   because of course there's going to be a lot of attention to Twitter and the zone of the
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.160]   IPO.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160]   I don't know.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.160]   It's crazy though.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:46.200]   And I'm sure that they're freaking out.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:54.080]   In whose interest is it to keep the IPO closed low in?
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.080]   Only somebody knows.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.080]   Has what?
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.200]   Oh, no, it wouldn't be in anybody's interest.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.200]   He's shorting.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:02.120]   It would be, I think it would be in Nick's interest to sell a lot of books.
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:06.120]   No, I'm thinking of competitors with enough money to our PR companies.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.120]   I don't know.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.120]   I think it counts.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.120]   Pounce.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.120]   Pounce.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:12.120]   Right.
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:13.120]   Jai Ku.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.120]   Jai Ku, right.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:15.720]   I think of sponsor, weren't they?
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.240]   No, I just loved them.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.480]   Google bought them, put them out of their misery.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.480]   I think of all the companies that ran at Twitter and boom.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.480]   All hit a wall.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.480]   Like Gallipoli.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.480]   They just fell by the wayside.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.480]   Gallipoli with no vowels.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.480]   That was another one.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.480]   That was another one.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.880]   But nobody, nobody I don't think has an interest in, in torpedoing their IPO.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:40.360]   It's more that this book comes out and they're, they are muzzled.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.600]   And so it's just an interesting and certainly is a, as a very sophisticated and very good
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.960]   a tech writer, Nick must have been aware of this dynamic.
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.760]   I, that well, you know, I don't know.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.760]   Maybe not.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:51.760]   I don't know, Nick.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.760]   Now that you bring this up, it's an interesting point.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.240]   I hadn't really thought about it.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.720]   Most authors don't really know when their book will come out.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:36:59.720]   That's a good, yeah.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.720]   You wrote this awhile ago, right?
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.280]   He wrote it awhile ago and all of a sudden he certainly could have known when the Twitter
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.440]   IPO would be.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:05.880]   That's only been recently discovered.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.880]   Another kind of surprising revelations, the story of how Evan Williams got forced out
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:18.360]   by the board, much to his shock and how Dick Costolo, who's currently the CEO of Twitter,
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.120]   almost got fired in 2010.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.040]   Well, to me, the most intriguing thing about Ev is he, I believe, is the only person on
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.880]   Earth who has ever made Robert Scoble angry.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.880]   And how did he do that?
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:31.320]   Well, it was on your show a few weeks back.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.840]   Like Robert was really mad about something furious.
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:40.920]   And then Williams had written, you know, he's got a new venture called Medium, which is similar
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:44.440]   to Twitter in the sense that he for free publishes other people's stuff and makes money
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.440]   on it.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.720]   But yeah, he was kind of bitching about the state of journalism and Robert said, "Hey,
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.720]   it's his fault."
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:53.720]   Yes, no, right.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.880]   Anyway, I can't wait.
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:00.640]   The book will be out, I think, next month from Penguin, it's called Hatching Twitter, a
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.120]   true story of money, power, friendship, and betrayal with the betrayal underscored.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.120]   Again, novel.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:07.120]   And the excerpt was extraordinary.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.120]   Oh, it's a page worth reading.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.880]   Of course, all these guys are going to get rich.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:15.440]   Dorsey will make $400 to $500 million when Twitter goes public.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:18.880]   The early engineers, however, may not get anything.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.520]   Well, it sounds like, you know, a glass who was instrumental to the creation of Twitter.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.440]   Again, there's two sides to every story.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.440]   We just see this one.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.160]   But according to that, it sounds like he was not only, not only came up with the idea,
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:33.800]   but was then squeezed out of the company and essentially dispossessed him almost all of
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:34.800]   his shares.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   That would be sad.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   Yeah, be tragic.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.160]   He was Evan Williams' neighbor.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.560]   That's how he got involved out that as a...
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.520]   He currently, according to this, lives in an apartment that was built as an earthquake
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:52.920]   shack in San Francisco.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:58.280]   He's in San Francisco, real estate, too expensive for things like that weren't built for their
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.280]   intended purpose to still be there.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.280]   That's weird.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:02.280]   Wow.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   What a story.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.280]   It's a terrible situation.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.280]   I don't...
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.280]   What do you think of Twitter's IPO?
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:09.680]   I feel like Twitter is a very fragile proposition.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.720]   It's not making money yet.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.720]   It is...
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.240]   I mean, I feel that it is...
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:22.080]   It's embedded itself in the popular consciousness and in usage patterns in ways that other flashes
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.080]   in the panel are embarrassing.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.080]   It's amazing.
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.400]   I think no TV show can be on the air without a Twitter hashtag.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.800]   I think it's an incredibly valuable beachhead that they've seized, but they haven't figured
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.280]   out how to make money from it yet.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:36.520]   I think it's mind share exceeds its market share in the sense that every journalist,
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:42.440]   every television show, every celebrity is on it, talks about it constantly, and it really
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:47.040]   has, as you say, it's become sort of part of our public vernacular.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:50.280]   But that doesn't mean it's something that people are going to absolutely depend on.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:54.880]   And right now, it's doing well, but it's really hard for me to know what kind of...
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.720]   Doing well is doing well in mind share, not doing well in revenue.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:39:59.720]   It's got no...
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:00.720]   Right.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:01.720]   It's a big money.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.120]   I imagine doing well in terms of the number of people who use it, what?
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.360]   200 monthly active, 200 million users.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.840]   That's not a bad number.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:10.680]   It's not as good as Facebook, but still not a bad number.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.800]   But again, how much time are they spending on it?
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:15.280]   What are they doing with it?
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.280]   These are questions.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:21.200]   And more important, what will be the state of the art three, four, five years ago for now?
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:22.200]   That's it.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.200]   That's what I want to know.
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.560]   It feels like it's a house made of smoke.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:30.600]   I mean, just as MySpace was replaced by Facebook almost overnight, it feels as if, although,
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.200]   again, we mentioned all the people who've tried to take on Twitter and failed.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.680]   And it's deliberately so lo-fi.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.080]   I mean, that's the thing that's intriguing.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.080]   I mean, it's not going to...
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.080]   Well, that's the challenge.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.880]   You could put messages up that were a lot more than 140 characters and a lot better
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.080]   than text only many, many years before Twitter came along.
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:52.280]   And so they've kind of made a virtue of this sort of lo-fi aesthetic and it works for people.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.680]   Are they... it feels as if they're cashing in at the right time at the peak about just...
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:57.680]   Well, for instance.
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.360]   Assuming the government doesn't default on its dad and knock the market down by 75%.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.960]   That would be a bad time to...
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:03.960]   Near the peak, certainly.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:04.960]   Yeah, that can make a...
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.280]   No, one of the problems with Twitter is it clicks through right.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:12.240]   So if you tweet, and even if you have a lot of followers, the percentage of those followers
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:16.320]   who are going to click through on any link you put in there are not as high as I think
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.800]   a lot of marketing people would like.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   Oh, I'm not even in them.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.800]   It would be a problem.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:21.800]   In fact, I can't damn near zero.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.120]   I don't think people read Twitter feeds particularly anymore.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.120]   Right?
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.480]   You'd have an enormous number of tweets.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.640]   You would be overwhelmed if people were...
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:35.320]   I couldn't read them all, but I use Twitter as a input to say, flip board and other social
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.720]   news sites, but that's not going to get Twitter any benefit at all.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.160]   Yeah, it really gets inhaled, right?
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.040]   Twitter growth is slowing.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.480]   Last year, 78% increase in growth.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.720]   This year, 44%.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.040]   That's a big slowdown, although still growing.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.800]   And from a much bigger base.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.920]   You would kill for that kind of growth.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920]   I know.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.360]   I'd love 44% growth.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.320]   We're 5% year over year.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.320]   I'd take 44% percent.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.000]   But the problem with that, it's overheated and sometimes that kind of thing can be even.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.080]   I'm still trying to figure out how they make money with it.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.840]   Well, in sponsored posts, right?
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.960]   They're doing that.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:15.720]   But the problem is in order to make that work, and this is, you could see Twitter's strategy
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.520]   change over the years because of this, you have to go to the Twitter.com.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.720]   And that's why they don't want it.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:22.720]   Nobody does that.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.200]   Nobody goes there.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:27.360]   And so that Twitter has started to kill the third party apps so that they at least can
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.640]   force you to use a Twitter app.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:32.280]   Which is why they bought TweetDeck.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:33.280]   Right.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.280]   It's very on now.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.280]   I think it's a challenge.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.680]   I'm not sure it's an automatic.
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:41.680]   When Nielsen announced this week that they're going to have TV ratings through Twitter.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.120]   What does that even mean?
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.120]   I don't know.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.240]   It'll measure the number of people.
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:51.160]   This is, okay, so Nielsen will give a TV show, a number of people watching, what share of
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.720]   the total audience, what share of the available audience.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.440]   Now they'll also give you a rating that says, "How many people tweeted about your program?"
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.440]   TweetShare.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.440]   TweetShare.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.240]   And how many people viewed those messages?
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.240]   Luckily, it's--
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.000]   Can you hire people in India to tweet about your program and get a higher Nielsen?
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000]   It's already happened.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.400]   Oh, it's about to say, luckily the TV industry is so ethical nobody's going to try to hijack
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:12.400]   this system.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:16.640]   So of course, if it were a dirty industry then people would suddenly start setting up fake
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.640]   accounts but there's no way.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.640]   Well, that's--
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:24.640]   And nobody ever bribed any of those 1,200 people who are the Nielsen rating.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.040]   Oh my God, can you imagine?
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.040]   Oh God.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.040]   So--
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.680]   So 100 people determined what the Nielsen rating is.
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.560]   Well, maybe this is better.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:36.280]   Maybe this is a better solution than people need us.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:41.920]   Well, I think this is better in the sense of getting an actual picture of who's watching
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.920]   the shows.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:43.920]   But it's talking about--
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:44.920]   It's more gameable.
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:45.920]   Yeah, excuse me.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:46.920]   No, look, these days--
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:52.600]   I don't know if there's only 1,200 people and it's impossible to keep them-- keep sacred
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:56.360]   who they are, I would think that's kind of gameable too.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:57.360]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:58.360]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.520]   If people are watching television on the internet, if they're watching on a TV or a
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:05.120]   PVR, aren't there ways to actually know exactly how many people are watching?
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.120]   Yeah, TV--
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.120]   No, it's not--
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.120]   TV used to give us--
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.120]   Nobody's knowing that.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.120]   The way the Nielsen rating works is--
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.720]   The TV was paid to watch television.
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:16.120]   TV shows sells this information to TV shows.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:19.720]   When we were doing the screensavers, I saw graphs that showed not only how many people
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:24.120]   watched the show, but when they tuned in, when they tuned out, when they rewound the
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.120]   TV.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.120]   You'd see spikes at certain points in time.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.320]   Everybody rewound to that one.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.320]   What happened?
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.320]   Oh, it was Morgan.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.320]   Okay.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.320]   And so you can really-- you really can see--
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.320]   That was me.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.160]   --in a-- you know, it's Rob, but who would see more of her.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.920]   You can really see granular-- in a granular way, not merely how popular a show is, but how
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920]   popular a segment is.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920]   Right.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:43.920]   I mean, that was useful information.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.560]   Well, what's fascinating to me is it feels like the entire world is still catching up
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.560]   with where Tivo was nine years ago.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.560]   It's depressing.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.560]   Thanks to the networks.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.560]   I mean, the TVRs are just so primitive compared to what I had on my Tivo the first--
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:58.480]   And nobody uses Tivo anymore because the cable company gives you a crap DVR.
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:44:59.480]   And that's the one--
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.480]   And do the cable companies keep the same-- do they have the same analytics that Tivo
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.480]   had?
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:04.480]   They could.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.480]   Whether they do that, I don't know.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.480]   I would--
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:07.480]   I've got a dish network VV-- PVR.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:09.520]   I assume they know what I'm watching.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.880]   It's gone to be a revenue.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.880]   A huge revenue.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:14.880]   So Social Guide is the company that--
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:17.680]   But it's not watching it.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:18.680]   Pardon me?
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.880]   If you record it, you're not watching it.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.400]   Well, they can know if I play it back.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.880]   That was a big issue in the early days of Nielsen is one of the things that really hurt
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:26.880]   the screensavers.
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:30.000]   They did not count DVR episodes.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.400]   And our audience was more sophisticated than the average bear.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.760]   We had three or four times higher Tivo users show.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:35.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:36.760]   They had another network.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.320]   The only network that had any measurable Tivo usage--
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.320]   And now--
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:47.360]   Of course, the standard way of watching a TV show is to set it to record and then watch
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.000]   something already recorded while that's playing.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000]   Right.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000]   So you can skip the--
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000]   Skip the--
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000]   Skip the commercials.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.760]   You're reading the entire purpose of the commercial.
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.280]   But yeah, that's a big secret, isn't it?
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.280]   Nobody watches the commercial.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:02.280]   It's hardly a secret.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.280]   Unless they're very interesting.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:06.720]   Andy McDowell makes some interesting commercials.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:07.720]   Oh.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.520]   You know, last night we were watching somebody--
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.520]   Yeah, it's a cr--
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.000]   We actually back face to rewatch the commercial.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.400]   I can't remember what a commercial it was, but we actually went back and watched it.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.920]   Yeah, because it intrigued us.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:19.920]   It was something--
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.920]   Not a few times, yeah.
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.760]   So your fans forwarding through them and then you go, oh, wait a minute.
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.440]   This one, actually, I have a device that automatically skips over there.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.800]   Don't tell my friends at CBS.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:35.840]   Well, and of course, on demand and purchasing stuff is killing ads because if you get used
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:38.760]   to watching Breaking Bad as I have without any commercials--
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:43.560]   And then you want to watch it and it's loaded with-- you go, oh, how can anybody watch it?
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.240]   Well, then you also have to wait a week between each other.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:53.320]   Breaking Bad's season finale, by the way, had 20-- sorry, 1.24 million tweets--
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.320]   Wow.
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.120]   --picking at 20,000 tweets per minute.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:02.520]   The hashtag, goodbye, breaking bad, half a million times was used.
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.960]   And that's all from social guide, the new Nielsen ratings.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.960]   Okay, that's interesting.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.640]   That is genuinely interesting stuff.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:12.320]   But those statistics were gathered before the world knew that Nielsen was going to count
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.560]   them, report them, and excite advertisers with them.
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:18.160]   So I think the mere fact-- what is it, the Huntington effect?
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:22.480]   The mere fact that people know Nielsen is watching is going to queer those statistics
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.480]   very, very quickly.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:25.160]   Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.160]   Exactly.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:31.120]   And in fact, we've seen that because in movie stars actually over the last few years have
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:34.560]   been able to increase the amount of money they ask for in a movie based on the number
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.560]   of Twitter followers.
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560]   Are the followers.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.560]   Which of course is--
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.760]   --or immediately created a market for phony Twitter followers?
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:42.480]   So the Twitter follower number is now useless.
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.680]   Yeah, it's meaningless.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:47.600]   Because I would say at least half of the accounts on Twitter are phony accounts.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:50.320]   Oh, I know a lot of my 1,100 followers.
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.320]   Probably.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.320]   There is a--
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:54.320]   --by a hyperinflator page.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.320]   There is a page you can go to.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.320]   1,100 followers.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.480]   There's really more like 900.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:04.360]   There is a page-- I don't remember what it is where you can say-- you can-- yeah, it's
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:10.360]   a statuspeople.com does a check on how many of your followers are fake.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.360]   You're kidding.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.360]   Wow.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:13.360]   That's pretty cool.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:18.160]   Based on whether they have a profile picture or whether they've tweeted things like this,
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:21.120]   let me just authorize that app and see how many of my followers--
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.120]   Go on there right now.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:23.120]   All right.
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:24.120]   Now, can you check anybody?
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.880]   You can only check yourself.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.880]   You can-- I think you can check anybody.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:29.200]   Yeah, because otherwise they trigger no pages.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:31.320]   It says, "No data returned for Leo LaPorte."
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.960]   So apparently, I don't exist on that.
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:37.840]   The last time I did it was 30% of my followers were not real.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:38.840]   That's actually not so bad.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:44.360]   Why would somebody not real want to be one of your followers?
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.360]   I have many phony followers.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.840]   Yes, how?
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.800]   Well, in the hope that you'll follow the-- no, it's very issue.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:56.040]   This is one of life's unanswerable questions.
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:58.800]   The other should people who follow people so they'll follow you back.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.760]   That's the theory, I think.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.920]   The other thing is-- and this has been happening a lot.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:06.000]   I don't know if it's happened to you guys, but I'm getting a lot of direct messages from
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.520]   real people that are spam, that are fake.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.080]   Somebody's either compromised their account somehow, but all of a sudden, I'm getting
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.600]   DM's from real people that are promoting Viagra.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.480]   Don't you have to follow someone to get a DM from them?
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480]   Exactly.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.200]   Well, maybe it's New York City Comic Con coming up with a more cunning and diabolical
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.200]   language subvert.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.200]   Isn't that bizarre?
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.200]   Oh, my God.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.200]   That's so wrong.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:28.880]   It's like, yeah, it's like-- I know I keep making North Korean jokes, but this is the
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.880]   kind of thing you'd expect to happen in Pyongyang.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:31.880]   Yeah, you know, this is amazing.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.600]   Well, it's on the tone of the talk about it.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.600]   It's insane.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.600]   How much is it?
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.840]   I wonder if these things are all disclosed in Twitter's IPO filings.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:40.840]   I mean, these are risks.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.840]   These are secure risks.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:42.840]   They have to be right.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.680]   That lower the credibility of the service, and if they don't solve these problems, it
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.760]   affects their long-term viability.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:55.520]   So Comic Con, when you registered for it, you gave them your Twitter handle and authorized
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.040]   them to post on your behalf.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.840]   And the fine print on page 37 of their UI as soon as--
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:03.320]   It's not unusual to see that when you authorize an app, but just assume they're not going
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:04.320]   to do it.
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.320]   But they did.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:09.760]   They did with like, fawning, just stipulations to the awesomeness of Comic Con.
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:11.400]   Leo, what is this?
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:12.960]   They post on your behalf?
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:16.800]   Yeah, it says-- it would say, I can't believe how awesome it--
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:17.800]   What does it say?
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:18.800]   Here it is.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:19.800]   Here it is.
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:20.800]   Here it is, right?
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:21.800]   Here it is.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:22.800]   Here it is, right?
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:23.800]   Here it is, right?
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:24.800]   Here it is, right?
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:25.800]   Here it is, right?
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:26.800]   Here it is.
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:27.800]   Here it is, right?
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:28.800]   Here it is.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:29.800]   Here it is.
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.800]   This is it, you wrote that.
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:32.800]   No, but--
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.800]   Did you get paid for that?
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.560]   They never asked me for anything like that.
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.240]   I have a gold card, but of course that's San Diego Comic Con.
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.200]   Well, go back and look at your Twitter feed.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.200]   This is New York.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:43.200]   No, I have a--
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.200]   I apologize, by the way.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.880]   I have refrain from tweeting.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.240]   I never have tweeted in my life, and I don't pay attention to them.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:59.440]   I have a couple of very sharp readers who forward made tweets that actually make sense
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.360]   and maybe I get one a day.
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:02.860]   Well, the funny thing is--
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:04.560]   I don't pay any attention to Twitter.
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.600]   They're not going to make me money off of me.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:11.240]   This article, which is from Polygon, which is the gaming-- the new gaming channel from
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:15.640]   S-Fox, the Vox, the Verge people.
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.080]   Brian Crescente who writes for them say, "They tweeted on my account.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:21.120]   They tweeted for IGN's Greg Miller.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:22.440]   They're tweeting for journalists.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:25.280]   This is really dumb, bad enough to tweet for other people.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:29.800]   But tweet for people who buy, as they say, ink by the barrel, big mistake."
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.800]   Which is shameless.
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.800]   It's shameless.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:32.960]   Well, I mean, insane.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:33.960]   You're right.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:34.960]   Like this is the deal.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.120]   The new excuses and intern did it.
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:37.920]   And that's what I would-- just a suggestion.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:39.920]   Just mention the--
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:42.200]   Is there any way to find out if somebody is tweeting and lying?
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.200]   Well, they blame you, Rock War.
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.240]   Well, do you have a Twitter account, Jerry?
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:46.240]   No.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.240]   Then you're fine.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.240]   You're fine.
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:49.720]   Well, they probably fake count for you, Jerry.
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:54.520]   Maybe I would search Twitter.com/JerryPrennel makes-- well, in fact, now you better make a Twitter
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:55.520]   account.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.640]   Now, what's funny is I searched and I found a Twitter name.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:03.560]   So, Twitter has actually tweeted that Jerry Prennel is on this show to a fake Twitter
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.240]   account if you do not have one.
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.240]   Wait a minute.
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:07.240]   Jerry says a fantastic account.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.720]   It says, "This is not the human named Jerry Prennel.
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:14.760]   This is a bot account that auto tweets-- somebody must have made this for you, Jerry, that auto
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:15.760]   tweets your--"
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:20.360]   Oh, I'll bet you my daughter did that probably as a protection, yes.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360]   Okay.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.360]   That's a good thing.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.480]   If you should do this, you should have your name on Twitter.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:27.480]   If you don't, you're really running a risk.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:30.000]   Well, my daughter's really pretty sharp and I'm not too careful.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.040]   Yeah, I think Jerry-- I'm going to follow.
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:33.920]   You might be able to do is get a verified account.
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:37.960]   I did that where if you're a public figure, you can get a verified account and that means
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:41.560]   that people know it's the real Jerry Prennel versus the fake Jerry Prennel.
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:46.320]   But I have no desire to tell people when I'm going to have a ham sandwich.
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.160]   No, you don't have to use it for that.
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.160]   No, but Jerry--
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:53.160]   No, but if you go look at my Twitter account, there's a little symbol right there that tells
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:57.960]   you that it's verified that it really is me, which I think is an important thing if you're
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.960]   doing public stuff.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:02.040]   But you know, Jerry, I use it to promote my writing all the time.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.480]   Yeah, that's what Jerry's using it for, even though he doesn't know it.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.480]   Oh, no.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.480]   It's fine for that.
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.480]   Great title suggestion in the chat room.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.480]   I'll try and get in.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.480]   I'll try and get in.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.480]   I'll try and get in.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:12.480]   I have a good one with that.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.480]   It's a good one.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:14.480]   We're going with that.
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:15.480]   Captain something.
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:18.840]   That anybody who would be interested in what I have to say probably comes and looks at my
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.840]   website.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:22.440]   I've been asking for $10,000 since thousands of people--
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.440]   Oh, you're so old, still Jerry.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:24.840]   I need money to keep it open.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.800]   I mean, I have subscribers.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:27.800]   You're so old.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:29.800]   I'll run my website on the public radio.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:30.800]   You charge for content?
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.800]   I thought that was a little--
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:32.800]   No, I don't charge.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.800]   They said public radio.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:37.200]   He asks for contributions, which I think is a smart name.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.920]   No, I don't ask for contributions to ask for subscriptions.
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:41.880]   I do exactly like K-U-S-C does.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:42.880]   Right.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:46.720]   And in fact, I do it exactly when K-U-S-C does it.
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:49.480]   About three times a year, actually, this is a pledge week.
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:50.480]   I know.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:51.480]   That's a good idea.
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.480]   And then federal theft.
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.480]   And then federal theft.
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.480]   And you have to have a real estate.
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:56.480]   It was a rate of around 80%.
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:01.200]   And I have been doing this for 10 years, and it works pretty darn good.
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.160]   It's a fair income.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:06.240]   And I won't keep it up if I don't get subscriptions.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:10.400]   But I would think that anybody who really wants to know what I've got to say will come
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.760]   there and find it out.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:17.800]   Jerry is-- the National Public Radio says about a 4% subscription rate.
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:21.680]   Do you know of the people who read your column, "How Many Pay?"
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:29.840]   Oh, I don't know how many actual-- well, I know how many website hits we get.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.840]   Yeah, just divide.
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:36.320]   OK, it's in-- but my renewal rate is around 80%.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.440]   Do you get a tote bag with purchase?
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.440]   No.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.280]   I can burn series.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:42.280]   I can burn jazz.
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:43.280]   I can burn series.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:44.280]   I can't burn jazz.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:48.600]   You know, because I consider that as a model.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:52.160]   And we got about 2% I think it was.
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.280]   And I just decided that's not enough to grow to the degree that we wanted to.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.280]   I could have made $50,000 a year and done a podcast every week, but that wasn't going
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:03.280]   to-- Well, I don't need the obligation to go too high.
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.200]   After all, I'm 80 years old.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:12.800]   I don't want to collect people and drop dead and not be able to finish the site.
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:13.800]   You know what, Jerry?
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.000]   Same concerns.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.840]   That's why we ask for, you know, no money.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:20.320]   And when you subscribe, we only subscribe for a week.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:23.640]   Well, what you have-- you have advertising.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:25.120]   I don't do ads.
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.120]   Right.
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:27.120]   No, I wish I didn't.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.920]   I mean, nothing wrong with ads and nothing wrong with our advertisers, but--
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:33.760]   Nothing wrong with ads for tickety if you won't advertise anything you wouldn't use.
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:35.120]   Well, and that's our policy.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.960]   I've known you well enough to know you wouldn't do it.
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:44.120]   I just never did because with Biden it was contractual, like I couldn't take money from
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.120]   somebody else to be--
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.440]   Why use Google ads where on the theory that I don't have any control over the ad.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:52.640]   So in fact, I could say something negative about a company and they're just as likely
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.400]   to have an ad show up on my website--
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.040]   I've said stuff negative about advertisers, but that's not done well.
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.040]   Yeah, I've got a couple of--
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:00.440]   In your case, that could be a--
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.520]   That's why I said Google ad there.
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.800]   I'm going to be honest.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:04.800]   But the truth is ultimate.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:10.440]   I mean, if I had my choice if I had my druthers, I would far prefer to the direct drive model
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:15.400]   that you've got, Jerry, which is people who listen pay, but I just found that most people
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.400]   wouldn't.
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:19.040]   People are used to free media, so we do add supported free media.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.120]   Well, you make a lot more money at it than I am.
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:23.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:24.120]   You had a tip jar, right?
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.120]   Is that what you're talking about?
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:26.120]   We still have a tip jar.
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:28.120]   Okay, so this was something in addition to that or something from that.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.720]   Well, the first two years of Twit, we tried to do it just by subscription.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:33.720]   Got it.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:38.880]   And it would have made enough money for me to make a small, not really quite a living,
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:40.640]   but almost a living.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.800]   I'd be living in one of those earthquake shacks.
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:43.800]   Earthquake shacks.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.040]   Yeah, or a spider hole.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:48.120]   But we would never have done all-- you know, we've never built a million dollar studio
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:49.640]   and done the growth that we've done.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:52.640]   And I really wanted to try anyway.
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:54.280]   Might have been a mistake, but to try it.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.280]   No, you don't.
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.120]   You are the envy of the broadcasting industry.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.120]   Yeah, you.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.160]   People in the networks who look up to you and they were shocked to see how successful
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:06.600]   you'd become in the design meeting model.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.600]   Not the fort.
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:08.600]   I never thought he'd make it.
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:09.600]   I'm shocked.
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.600]   Pretty impressive.
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:12.600]   I always thought you would.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:15.600]   I thought you did it very well.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:16.600]   You're a very nice guy.
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:17.600]   Thank you.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:23.640]   The difference is you're willing to undertake the obligation to keep doing that at the pace
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:28.640]   you do it, whereas I do what I feel like doing.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:31.880]   If you want it to keep up, you pay me to do it.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:34.040]   If you don't want it to keep up, you don't.
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:36.680]   Joe, you don't have a payroll to keep up with either.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.320]   No, I don't have a payroll.
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:41.800]   I don't have big investments.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:46.280]   I use the money to buy new equipment every now and then, and I get enough to do it.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:49.400]   That's what I'm going to upgrade to the new Apple stuff.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.840]   It will be essential from the subscriptions I get to the site.
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:54.840]   That's nice.
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.840]   I think that's a good model.
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:56.840]   I mean, look, everybody who knows...
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.000]   Have everyone known, and I have readers who are concerned enough that they actually send
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000]   me equipment.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.800]   They don't ask for it.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:08.040]   Anybody of my generation or who grew up with Jerry Prenel, and he knows Jerry who read
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:12.880]   his books, who've read his column, wants to support you.
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.560]   This is my hope that when I get to 80 and I can't do this anymore, I'll have people
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.760]   sending me computers and whatever it is in the future.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:23.840]   Publish some e-books because it helps to have a backlift.
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:24.840]   I think so.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:25.840]   I think so.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:26.840]   Hey, we are going to take a break.
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:29.840]   I'm going to make a little money, and then we're going to wrap this thing up.
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:30.840]   We've got a great panel.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:31.840]   I've got to say, Jerry Prenel.
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:34.480]   Let me say something for the record right now.
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:42.080]   Any of you people who are contemplating being writers, be dang careful about your electronic
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:47.360]   rights, I think the e-book rights are now worth more than the print rights, which means
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:52.680]   that if somebody wants to offer you the kind of advance that is normal in print, but they
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:58.080]   want half your electronic rights forever as a consequence of it, I'd think very hard
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.960]   about taking that offer.
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:03.320]   This is a big issue all around.
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:07.600]   Not just first rights, but electronic rights in any creative field.
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:13.480]   In the first place with electronic rights, first rights as eternal, isn't it?
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:17.560]   Once the guy puts it up there, there's nothing causing him to take it down.
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:26.000]   If you've sold him a non-exclusive right forever, then he keeps it up there forever,
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.160]   and you never get another nickel.
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.320]   That's actually a very good point, isn't it?
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:34.000]   I have been trying to get this across to my fellow writers and science fiction writers
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:40.200]   of America that an electronic book contract that doesn't provide for further royalties
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:45.880]   after the initial publication of an anthology on the fact that it's non-exclusive isn't
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:47.440]   going to mean anything.
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.400]   He's got it forever.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:55.040]   He's basically done you as a work for hire, even though you didn't know that.
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:56.560]   So make it enough.
[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:58.640]   You better ask for enough than it is.
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:00.480]   That is worth it.
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:04.520]   When I started writing, when I was writing my syndicated column back in the 80s and 90s,
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:09.040]   the LA Times syndicate had no idea what electronic rights were worth, so they just kind of waved
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:10.040]   them.
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:11.040]   They said, "Okay, you could have them."
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:12.040]   Well, they can't.
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:13.040]   That internet's not going anywhere.
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:14.040]   It can't be worth anything.
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.040]   But unlike the music industry.
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:16.040]   Unlike the music industry.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:17.040]   Yeah, they know, didn't they?
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:24.080]   Oh, their contracts literally say across the universe in technologies, in perpetuity.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:28.600]   We used to say that too, for every medium known now or not yet known, or not yet known,
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.680]   ever to be created in the future for all time.
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:37.880]   A friend of mine was in a fun, actually rather successful 90s kind of power punk band called
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:39.480]   Too Much Joy.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:43.720]   And he wrote a song called In Perpetuity, where he literally, the lyrics were just lifted
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:45.800]   from his contract with Warner Brothers.
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:49.400]   It's like an in perpetuity across the universe.
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:51.280]   And it really, people really liked it.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.960]   It's kind of hard to believe they actually put that in a contract.
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.960]   His song was called In Perpetuity.
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:56.960]   In perpetuity.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:57.960]   Yeah.
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:01.320]   And he was in the house as Rhapsody, negotiating deals with the music.
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.040]   It was tough because we were first.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:07.560]   We were the first company to get full catalog licenses from all of the major labels.
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:10.080]   In fact, we were about a year and a half before iTunes.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.040]   And so there wasn't any precedent.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.400]   There wasn't any template.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:19.120]   And we were also asking for something really exotic, which was an unlimited streaming service.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.120]   Right.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:21.280]   Which is commonplace today.
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.080]   But back then- Could you say it's like radio, but it's on the internet?
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:25.960]   Is it more like it's like a jukebox.
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:28.000]   Because like radio implies it's not interactive.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.080]   A jukebox implies interactivity.
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:32.360]   So there's existing royalty rates for jukeboxes.
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:33.360]   Yeah.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:34.520]   And so we started gearing off of that.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.200]   But the funny thing was, despite the fact that these five major labels, there were five
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.200]   back in those days.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.600]   Now these three and falling.
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:45.440]   But the five major labels, although they were all allegedly bitter competitors, they
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:48.600]   all proposed the same rather exotic structure.
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:51.280]   Hey, Jerry, what do you offer in that kid Rob over there?
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:52.280]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.920]   Not only that, we got contracts from some of them that had identical typos.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:56.920]   And them.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:57.920]   Yeah.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:59.400]   It was really-
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:05.840]   In the publishers have always been the class enemy for creator, for, you know, writing.
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:06.840]   You need them.
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:07.840]   And you used to need them.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:08.840]   Oh, you have to have.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.400]   Well, you may have to do it anymore, do you?
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:12.400]   No.
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:13.400]   Not much.
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:14.400]   That's another program.
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:17.520]   And I'd be glad to come on and have that as a program theme.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:20.800]   But it's not something you're going to settle in two minutes before you close.
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:21.800]   Okay.
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:22.800]   Well, I'm not closing yet.
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:23.800]   So hang on.
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:25.280]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.

[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:57.760]   More than 20 templates to start with, but then you customize so that every Squarespace
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:02:59.320]   site looks unique.

[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:06.360]   That means they work no matter what size screen, everything from an iPhone to a 27-inch
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:09.000]   cinema display it's going to look great on.

[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:13.320]   It all works great.

[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:16.480]   Comments, everything.

[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:19.880]   They want a Stevie Award.
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.560]   Just want a gold Stevie Award for Outstanding Service.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:27.760]   And the price starts at $8 a month, including a free domain name when you sign up for a

[02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:00.320]   And I think to me that's why if you're a creator, this is a golden age.
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:02.440]   I mean, oh, it's amazing.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:06.040]   I mean, you can choose whatever model you want.
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:11.880]   That's for me as a first-time novelist, I mean, third book but first-time novelist.
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:15.920]   Having a big publisher like Random House line up behind the book was essential to get
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:17.640]   my name out there.
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:21.600]   But as one gets more and more established or if somebody has just got like unbelievable
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:26.000]   social media energy, it's entirely possible to go direct.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:33.080]   And it's still particularly with electronic books and keep a very big piece of the revenue.
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:37.360]   But for nobody like me, definitely a publisher is important.
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:38.360]   Here's a kind of a blow to-
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:42.480]   That's where the publisher starts at being important.
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:43.480]   It's marketing.
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:50.360]   Publishers have not yet figured out that that is there really the only essential thing they
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:51.520]   do.
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:54.080]   Some of them may be getting smart enough to figure that out.
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:06:00.280]   Well, now that you don't have to get shelf space in a bookstore or pay for an author tour,
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:01.680]   the role is different.
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:05.800]   And maybe instead of publishing, we have agencies that that's their job.
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:06.800]   I think it'll move.
[02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:10.960]   I think agents, I think literary agents that are very modern and have relatively large
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:13.800]   operations will start branching into that.
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:17.840]   The trick they're going to have is that they could arrange the publishers, of course, who
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:20.360]   are very, very important partners of theirs.
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:21.360]   Always the problem.
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:22.360]   Always the problem.
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:26.080]   But I think you're going to see the really smart, forward agents starting to do that
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:27.080]   kind of thing.
[02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:28.080]   Interesting.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.080]   Ariel.
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:31.080]   Let's talk about Ariel.
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:33.560]   Ariel is, of course, Barry Diller's play.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:38.680]   I always thought it was just an interim thing, you know, until it's all over the internet.
[02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:42.960]   And the meanwhile, while they're still broadcast television, it's a clever workaround.
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:43.960]   It seems like a job.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.440]   They created dime-sized antennas.
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:48.220]   They put them in a massive array in major cities.
[02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:52.840]   And then you rent the antenna, which gives you access to broadcast over the air television
[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:54.120]   in that area.
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:56.320]   New York had it first.
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.960]   Ariel just went, of course, the networks are livid.
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:06:59.960]   Of course.
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:03.680]   They would love to kill this retransmission fees are a very big part of the revenue.
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:05.200]   And they get that from cable company.
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.200]   Precisely.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:07.200]   This is just to intermediates them.
[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:08.200]   This cuts it right out.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:09.200]   Who was it?
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:11.000]   Two of the networks, I think, was CBS and Fox.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:17.480]   So I said, we're just going to go off the air in those cities because we.
[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:24.760]   But a big, big victory in Boston, a federal judge was they petitioned US District Judge
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:26.720]   Nathaniel Gordon.
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:28.760]   Channel five petition said injunction.
[02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:31.840]   This is from rehearsed is the broadcast in this case.
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:34.280]   Stop Ariel.
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:37.080]   And the judge said, Ariel does not violate copyright.
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:42.000]   It's just like a remote DVR service that lets you watch and record individual copies for
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.680]   private use.
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:44.680]   That's not illegal.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:49.880]   You remember the, was it the diva, which was the service where they had these, a rack
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:52.440]   of DVD players, I think, funny pale.
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:53.440]   Yes.
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:56.160]   And you essentially rent a movie, but what you're really doing is renting the diva.
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:59.520]   It's a similar concept and they got shut down by the courts.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.400]   But might have been because that was on demand.
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:04.800]   It might because like when you get on demand, you get into a whole new realm of law, at least
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:05.800]   in music.
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:09.280]   That's the reason, but this just, this seemed like almost like a joke when it first came
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:10.280]   out.
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:12.040]   Like, yeah, we're going to have bazillions of antennas.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:13.600]   And they have not lost legally.
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:15.480]   They have not lost yet in court.
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:17.200]   Broadcasters say we're going to the Supreme Court.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.680]   You know, they, they've been killing it legally, but there's this interesting dimension.
[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:22.760]   Have you heard of tune to dot FM?
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:24.800]   I think is called tune to dot.
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:26.320]   I think that's what it is.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:28.680]   I hope I don't have it wrong.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:32.880]   It's a guy named David Alky, a L K I who's an eccentric billionaire.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:38.040]   I think he's from a wealthy family Coca Cola family or green shipping or broadcasting out
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:39.520]   of a mountaintop layer.
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:40.840]   I don't know.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:42.040]   But so here's the thing.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:45.280]   So he's apparently he created this thing and I think it was called tune.
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.280]   I might have it wrong or tune.
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:49.680]   No, because you bought a company in 2001.
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:50.680]   Yeah.
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.880]   That's why it stuck in my head.
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:54.600]   Try searching on David Alky, a L K I.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:55.600]   There it is.
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:56.600]   Is that it?
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:58.640]   It was tune in radio, but I mean tune in.
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:08:59.640]   That's it.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:01.400]   I think that's I think that's the thing that's a radio thing.
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:02.800]   Well, I know tune in radio pro.
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:03.800]   Why use that all the time?
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:04.800]   It's awesome.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:08.480]   This is David Alky is the heir to the Coca Cola Hellenic shipping and bottling.
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:09.480]   I was with you.
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:10.480]   P D.
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:11.480]   P D.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:12.480]   Let's see if I can find what he did.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:16.880]   Mike Masik from Techdirt was telling me that apparently film on you talking about film
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:19.040]   on film on to sons of bitches.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:20.040]   I hate them.
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.520]   They're rebroadcasting us.
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.520]   There you go.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:23.520]   Film on.
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:24.960]   I hate them.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.360]   I knew it was a long word fella losers.
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:29.000]   By the way, they've lost every court.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.480]   Well, so what Mike Masik from Techdirt told me is apparently the broadcasters because they're
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:38.720]   getting shellacked by by Ariel has decided that they're going to take on film on instead
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:43.920]   because it's a very, very similar model and apparently their legal team is not as slick.
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:48.280]   So that seems to be and nobody knows the right stuff.
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:52.760]   They're rebroadcasting over the internet basically everything.
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:53.760]   Everything.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:54.760]   Including Twit.
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.760]   Yes.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:56.760]   Whatever they can get.
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:57.760]   Yeah.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:09:59.080]   Are they stripping out our ads?
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.160]   I don't know what they're doing.
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:02.360]   I remember that they were putting ads in.
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:06.200]   They're violating our license agreement for sure.
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:07.200]   But there's nothing.
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.200]   What am I going to sue them?
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.200]   There's nothing I can do about them.
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:11.680]   Well, I think that the broadcasters are the biggest handle list.
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:17.040]   What I understand from Mike is that the broadcasters believe that film on is a similar enough service
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:22.640]   to Ariel that if they get precedent with film on that doesn't have the platinum minted
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.200]   legal team that Ariel has, they're going to have a better shot at winning something like
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:28.200]   that.
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:32.080]   So here's channel nine in San Francisco broadcasting.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.120]   I'm connecting to a remote antenna he says.
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:36.120]   So he says.
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:37.120]   And there it is.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:39.760]   And I can watch us on the internet even if I'm not in San Francisco.
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:42.400]   And this is by the way this this good year ad.
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:45.760]   That's a that's a film on that's a film on ad.
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:46.760]   So good year is supporting.
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:48.280]   Well, not just good year.
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:50.160]   A lot of companies are supporting this.
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:53.280]   Are we on live with them?
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:54.280]   There they are.
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:55.280]   Yeah.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.280]   I don't know.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:00.280]   They're just doing the I think they're that's just the audio version.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.400]   Click the click the HD see what you get up on the right there.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:04.720]   Do you get video?
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:08.920]   One difference is that Ariel I believe is not inserting their own ads right into other
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:09.920]   people's programs.
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:10.920]   Right.
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:12.960]   They get their money via subscription fee.
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:16.800]   So the networks are so on one level the networks are getting more viewers which is good for
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:17.800]   their advertisers.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:18.800]   Right.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:19.800]   But they're getting less of their their.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:21.800]   They're not going to be the retransmission fees.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:22.800]   Yeah.
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.800]   Yeah.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:26.240]   That's what's difficult to justify because from from I think a lot of people are getting
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:28.640]   more people's point of view and possibly even these judges they're saying well wait a
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:31.560]   minute you're free in that city anyway.
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:32.560]   Right.
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:33.800]   You're monetizing with advertising.
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:37.400]   You're not losing a single viewer.
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:38.880]   You're not losing anybody.
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:39.880]   Yes.
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:40.880]   How are you damaged?
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:41.880]   How are you?
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:45.720]   You're damaged if people are stopping to pay transmission fees which of course people will
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.960]   if they can find more and more excuses to get rid of cable companies.
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:52.080]   And that's the point which is fear.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:55.160]   That's the point which is most people don't watch over the year.
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:57.840]   Most people watch on cable so they're in effect double dipping.
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:01.960]   They're showing you the ads and they're getting the retransmission fees from the cable company
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:04.280]   and they've got decided they kind of like that.
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:05.280]   Yeah.
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:07.320]   That's a good model for them.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:08.320]   Right.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:11.080]   Back before they did the retransmission fees they might have welcomed Ariel.
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:12.080]   Well.
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:13.080]   You can get a free Saraudian.
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.080]   I doubt it.
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:20.280]   But so the model on film on those sons of bitches is free on standard definition with
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:25.560]   ads or I can pay for it in high definition and not have any ads.
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:32.000]   And by the way notice this is channel nine a broadcast and public broadcasting not for
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.640]   profit and they've got a film on bug even over it.
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:37.640]   Oh wow.
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:41.680]   I mean this is this is anyway so that Alky guy no friend of mine.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:45.600]   Now would it be funny if you recorded this and then put it up on YouTube and then film
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:50.760]   on Sude You for copyright infringement because they probably would probably going to pull
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:51.760]   it off YouTube.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:55.680]   Oh what a world what a world.
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:13:00.240]   There's Alan with a big film on bug.
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:02.680]   I can understand why broadcasters would be unhappy about this.
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:04.840]   This is this is fairly outrageous.
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:05.840]   Yeah.
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:10.440]   Tony Fadel the guy who created the iPod then went on to create that great little thermostat
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:11.440]   the nest.
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.440]   Yeah.
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:13.440]   Is that still hot?
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.440]   I think it's pretty hot.
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:16.440]   But now he got the smoke.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.040]   Now he's got a small hundred twenty nine dollars for the nest to protect.
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:23.480]   What is this an internet connected to tell your houses burning down over the internet.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:24.480]   It's going to tweet it.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.760]   It's going to follow the fire department and then if you're following your own Twitter
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:30.120]   feed you'll find out that your house your house is here.
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:31.120]   Tony.
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:35.160]   Tony says safety shouldn't be annoying.
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:37.280]   Well maybe it should.
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:38.280]   If it's a fire alarm.
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:41.080]   Ask very gently do you mind leaving the burning plane.
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:49.000]   So it's exactly it says in a calm female voice heads up there's smoke in the kitchen.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:50.560]   Which I get a lot by the way.
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:54.120]   What lady bug lady bug fly away home.
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:55.120]   You're out.
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:58.280]   You're singing a song.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.000]   By the way you shut it up.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.120]   You shut up and this is a little too easy by waving at it.
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:04.120]   It's okay.
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:05.120]   It's cool.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:06.120]   It's a cool man.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:07.120]   It's a lot of issues.
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:09.760]   There's a lot of fake you know there's a lot of false alarms.
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:11.760]   It gets rid of the false positive.
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.760]   Right.
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:14.320]   That's the issue.
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:19.760]   It is of course ridiculously expensive at $129 considering you can get a you know first
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:20.960]   alert for 20 bucks.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:24.320]   I found a smoke detector on Amazon for $7.98.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:25.320]   They're cheap.
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:26.720]   But you don't want to necessarily skip on safety.
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:27.720]   I get that.
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:32.280]   And by the way the folks at first alert are also doing a similar smoke detector that
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.440]   talks to you.
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.480]   So okay.
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:39.560]   When it understand the meaning of a wave.
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:40.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.560]   Wave it off.
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:42.560]   That's the.
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:43.560]   Well.
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:44.560]   Maybe fury.
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:45.560]   Maybe this is not the fire you're looking for.
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:46.560]   But Larry's right.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:48.720]   It's all about it's all about the false positives.
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:50.640]   And that's what drives people crazy about smoke alarms.
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:51.640]   Right.
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:54.760]   You know you've charred some bacon in the kitchen and the things screeching.
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:58.640]   And if I think that's the problem they're solving and if people rip out the cables and
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:01.160]   they rip out the batteries and they don't have a smoke alarm anymore.
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:02.920]   So it could solve for that.
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:04.840]   Maybe apple should do one and they could use fury.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:06.840]   You know you can talk to your smoked a test.
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:10.320]   She could say did you say you're having dinner or.
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:12.320]   She's got a wrong.
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:13.320]   It's okay.
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.320]   Your house will be.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.320]   I have the nest.
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:16.320]   I'm not crazy about it.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:18.080]   It turns on the heat in opportune moments.
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:19.080]   Really.
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:20.080]   Yeah.
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:22.440]   I don't it's like you're supposed to learn that but I don't know what it's learning.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.440]   So I'm sorry Dave.
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:25.800]   I can't do that.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:26.800]   It's kind of like that.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:29.400]   I've got to make your house warmer.
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:30.400]   Exactly.
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:37.640]   I've exceeded your autonomy to some device but I love it that what you've got is a class
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:40.600]   now of entrepreneurs who are so cocky.
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:41.880]   We've reinvented music.
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:44.800]   Well let's find another category and reinvent that.
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:45.800]   Smoke alarm.
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:46.800]   Smoke alarm.
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:47.800]   They're coming up with interesting stuff.
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:48.800]   I can see the power point.
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:51.560]   Smoke alarms are a six billion dollar industry.
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:53.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:54.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:56.000]   You can totally see the power point.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000]   That's really what determines these products.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.800]   Whether you can pitch them to a venture capital.
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:00.800]   Right.
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:01.800]   Oh yeah.
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:02.800]   Yeah.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:03.800]   Yeah.
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:07.160]   I try to figure out what problem it's solving other than the shirling alarm.
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:10.200]   I can set my smoke detector from an iPad.
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:11.200]   Mmm.
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:12.800]   And how do you set your smoke detector?
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:13.800]   I don't know.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:14.800]   Look see she's cooking.
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:15.800]   The smoke detector goes off.
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:16.800]   That's cool.
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:17.800]   I see.
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:18.800]   That's good.
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:20.360]   I wave a broom at mine and if you set your...
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:21.920]   This is the wave I do.
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:27.880]   Well if you start waving your hands in panic because the place is on fire and it shuts
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:30.040]   off and you roll over and go back to sleep.
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.680]   I'm waiting for Chad to show me so I can...
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:35.520]   I realize.
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:37.000]   Alright.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.400]   You know what I didn't do?
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:40.280]   It's been, I've been gone for a while.
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:42.080]   Yeah that.
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:44.880]   Let's see if you missed anything on Twit this week.
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:46.480]   Is it going to be OMG TV again?
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.880]   I hope not.
[02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:49.920]   I am not enamored of that notion.
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:52.560]   Let's see what you missed this week on Twit.
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:54.960]   Previously on Twit.
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:55.960]   Matt Braid Weekly.
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:56.960]   Are you training?
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:57.960]   I just recognize your tongue now.
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:58.960]   I don't think it's going to work.
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:16:59.960]   It won't get more really.
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:00.960]   It's really gross.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:01.960]   I can't.
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:02.960]   Because there's no world on the tongue.
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:03.960]   There's no world on the tongue.
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:04.960]   Oh!
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:05.960]   Frame rate.
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:08.960]   Nielsen is going to measure television shows on Twitter.
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:10.960]   Are they going to keep track of it on Snapchat?
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:13.080]   Are they going to be falling on Instagram?
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:14.080]   I mean this...
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:16.640]   I applaud you on catching up with 2008.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:17.640]   Windows Weekly.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:22.120]   Did you see that video of the new Fox News set?
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:24.400]   It's like the Unpalumpas working a giant iPad.
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:29.040]   There are great uses for perceptive pixels displays in newsrooms.
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:33.400]   Plus when nothing is going on they can use it to play cut the rip iPad today.
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:38.160]   This is the dawning of the age of the crack city.
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:40.160]   Age of the crack city.
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:41.160]   Twit.

[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:47.600]   Nothing will happen.
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:49.200]   Great Jim Cutler who does our...
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:51.080]   And by the way pro bono thank you Jim.

[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:02.880]   Hey thanks Leo it's good to have you back so I can say thanks Leo instead of trying
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:04.920]   to guess who's there every week.
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:08.960]   Here's a few other things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:14.240]   Monday is a day off for some in the United States Columbus day but Tuesday October 15th

[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:27.360]   Thursday October 17th the online news association conference happens in Atlanta.
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:29.440]   It's IMDB's birthday.
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:32.200]   Microsoft Windows 8.1 launches.
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:38.120]   Ubuntu smartphone OS also supposed to be ready for launch as well as Ubuntu 13.10.
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:42.760]   Friday October 18th it's Nintendo's NES's birthday.

[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:48.480]   That's a look at the week ahead back to you Leo.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:50.680]   Leo do you know that Monday is Thanksgiving in Canada?
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:54.720]   Yes I do know that I found that I called tech support for this product and it was a Canadian
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:58.120]   company and they told me they're closed on Thanksgiving Monday.
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:59.120]   Thanks give me a new.
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:05.680]   Yeah I knew because I used to go to Canada every month to eat Turkey.
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.800]   They have a monthly Thanksgiving of a month.
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:09.400]   They are so grateful up there.
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:11.000]   There's so much to say every month.
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000]   They should be.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000]   It's a healthy year.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.240]   Thank you for making it.
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:17.640]   It's that socialized medicine that Jerry probably has.
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:20.400]   Right no they're grateful because when you go to Turkey you don't have to say I'm from
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:21.400]   Canada.
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:22.400]   You are.

[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:38.280]   Jerry ran out of words.
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:42.640]   I didn't think that was possible.
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:43.640]   Thank you Jerry.
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:46.520]   Thanks to Larry Maggad CBS Radio Larry's World dot com.

[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:02.960]   Oh yeah.
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:05.320]   You've just made a lot of Canadians.
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:09.160]   Less than a good Thanksgiving tomorrow.
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:17.800]   Anything else you want to plug Rob as long as you're here you got the book.
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:18.800]   What are you doing?
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:20.280]   Morgan doing more to the point.
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:22.560]   Morgan's working on a secret project.

[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:27.560]   Okay.
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:28.560]   I can only talk about what she's come to.
[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:30.760]   Come back when actually Morgan should come back.
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:31.760]   She can come back and she should have that idea.
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:35.200]   Yeah I haven't seen Morgan since I talked to her last secret project which is a big
[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:36.200]   mistake.
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:38.840]   I know I'm no longer have the floor but can I plug something?
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:39.840]   Oh yeah.

[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:57.880]   Not an epidemic but for the families that are affected by it it's a problem.
[02:20:57.880 --> 02:21:03.720]   It's nasty and you should just know about it and know what the issues are and be prepared
[02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:04.720]   to do.
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:06.280]   Thanks for letting me.

[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:58.840]   Do the twit.
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:21:59.840]   All right.
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:00.840]   Do the twit.
[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:01.840]   All right.
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:02.840]   Do the twit.
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:03.840]   Do the twit.
[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:04.840]   All right.
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:05.840]   Do the twit.
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:06.840]   All right.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:07.840]   Do the twit.
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:08.840]   Baby.
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:15.200]   So Hawaii used a WordPress blog for its healthcare you know the sign up.
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:16.200]   That's interesting.
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:17.200]   Oh my gosh.
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:20.600]   And apparently they were like major security flaws.
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:22.680]   Is it running on an Amiga?
[02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:24.960]   An admin the password.
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:27.440]   The federal one is also running on WordPress.
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:28.920]   Yeah okay.
[02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:33.000]   Yeah add add WP hyphen admin to the thing.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.200]   Yeah let's see if we can uh...
[02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:35.200]   You can have it.
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:36.200]   Okay.
[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:38.600]   This is probably a federal crime.
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:39.600]   Nobody's watching.
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:40.600]   Yeah look.
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:41.600]   Try nobody's looking.
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:43.400]   I love it.
[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:44.400]   Try admin admin admin.
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:46.400]   Try admin admin password is password.
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:48.800]   Yeah just say password.
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:53.400]   Oh and remember me because if I get in I want to I want to stay there.
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:57.880]   We'll never remember this crazy password we just put in.
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:58.880]   No.
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:22:59.880]   Monkey.
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:04.120]   Monkey 123 I think is the federal password.
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:05.120]   Maybe Washington.
[02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:06.120]   No.
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:07.120]   Lincoln.
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:09.800]   But you see how easy it is to try to brute force this.
[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:10.800]   I mean it doesn't.
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:11.880]   Praise the mama.
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:13.400]   I cannot believe this.
[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:15.400]   I mean I could...
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:18.360]   Oh wait a minute let me see I lost my password.
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:22.760]   Let's see here let me email it to me at leo.com.
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:27.840]   Awww there's no user with that name.
[02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:35.520]   How about president at white house dot gov?
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.520]   Nope.
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:38.680]   POTUS is it POTUS not president?
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:40.320]   POTUS is a good guess.
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:43.800]   Oh maybe that's the password.
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:46.440]   If I get in I'm going to jail you understand that.
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:49.360]   No I don't think you're going to finish this program.
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:53.360]   The password might be like bainer sucks.
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:56.880]   They are already activated in patelluma.
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.800]   They know.
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:04.760]   But you should not be able to go to get covered america.org/wp log in.
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:05.760]   And it shouldn't give you that.
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:06.760]   That's ridiculous.
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:08.360]   This is white hat stuff here.
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:12.200]   try to find probed weaknesses so that they can fix me and Adrian Lama.
