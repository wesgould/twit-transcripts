[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech. We're doing a cottage style. All of my guests are
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.760]   in Skype with Sores behind me and we've got lots to talk about, including why it's dangerous
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   to use carplay and Android Auto. More dangerous than drinking. Steven Sanovsky, former Windows
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.800]   8 designer, says the iPad is a breakthrough. The new iPad will talk about that and how
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.440]   to avoid Zoom bombing. It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.120]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. The show we cover the weeks. Tech News. With some
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   of the most interesting journalists in the business, we've got three Twit friends on
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.760]   today. I'm very happy. First time ever on the show. I think Lou Mareska. This is your
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.720]   first time. It's right. Yeah. It's first time, first time for everything, right?
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:49.520]   Lou is the longtime host of this week in Enterprise Tech. Long time, not really. But
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.040]   you took over for Father Robert when he left. So it's been a year and right at least.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.760]   Yeah. A long time co-host for seven years before that. Yeah.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.280]   Before that also on coding 101, we love Lou. He is a principal engineering manager at Microsoft
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.080]   in the office products division. And they let you do this, huh?
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.920]   They do. They love it. They think it's great. You know, and I just try to stay very open
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.320]   and for all technology and not favorite Microsoft, obviously. And it works out great. I think
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.640]   they enjoy me being on. Well, we're thrilled to have you. That's a great score for us.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.360]   So with us, Mr. Mike Elgin, of course, we love Mike. Our parapetetic gastronomad is home.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.440]   Yes, in Silicon Valley, South Silicon Valley, where I'm sheltering in place. And I figured
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.600]   if I had to shelter in a place, I wanted to be in a place where I have health insurance
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.120]   and access to hospitals and all that kind of stuff. So no, it's great to be here. And
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.160]   I didn't want to get stuck in Mexico where I was before. So I'm glad to be back. It's
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.440]   wonderful as Mexico City is. And I'm sure that people are really warm and helping each other
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.040]   and all that. It's still, you know, a little challenging, I'm sure to be there. And it's
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.000]   always better to be back with your family. My son, Henry, who's 25 left to travel Asia.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.840]   Boy, he couldn't have picked a worst time at the end in December. And he's been to Thailand,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.360]   Vietnam. He's been to all the hotspots. And he's currently in Valley. And he's gone,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.000]   should I come home? And I don't know. I'm thinking, maybe, maybe yes, maybe no, maybe you won't
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.320]   be able to get home. I don't know. There's no direct flights. He'd have to fly through Singapore,
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.360]   which is closed down. Also with us, Sam, Apple, Sam, and he is our car guy. And we've, he's been on,
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.120]   whoops, let me get your lower third. I'm doing the switching today. So it's going to be interesting.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.800]   Sam is a principal researcher at Navigant Research. He's also the host of the Wheel
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.720]   Bering's podcast at wheelbarings.media. Hi, Sam. Hi, Leo. Good to be back again.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.040]   The original plan was I was supposed to be in studio with you today. But coming in
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.600]   ahead of NVIDIA GTC this week, but obviously that was canceled. And so was everything else.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.440]   So here I am. You live in Detroit. Is Detroit shut down? I don't know what the rules are.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.000]   Every state seems to have different rules. What's Michigan doing? We're not on a full
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.760]   shelter in place yet, like Silicon Valley is, or I guess all of California now.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.720]   But about a week or so ago, the governor ordered all the restaurants and bars and
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.320]   nonessential businesses to shut down. And so the only thing they're allowed to do is do
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:45.120]   curbside service or take out service for food. So a lot of restaurants have just closed completely.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.840]   Others, friends of ours that has a restaurant in downtown Ann Arbor,
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   they're doing curbside take out service. So everybody's just trying to get through this.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.520]   All the car plants and parts plants are all shut down. All the engineers and everybody else
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.720]   are working from home. So it's tough. And you're in, Lou, you're in Seattle, which is, of course,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.120]   the epicenter at least was. Now you're no longer the epicenter, but for a long time was the epicenter
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.000]   of this. How are things there? You know, it's interesting. The governor has yet to shut everything
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.080]   down. We're still kind of still essential, nonessential people obviously still working.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.000]   Businesses are still going on. Everything's kind of still open.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.160]   Restaurants are still open. So they're still encouraging people to go out. I'm guessing that
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.520]   sudura later, it will end up just like the rest of the states. Wow. Wow. Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.360]   Yeah. No, yeah. And of course, Lou has like 15 children. So you probably, how many children?
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.760]   Yeah. Yeah. Four. Fifth on the way. You never know. We're all kind of cooped up in here.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.520]   You never know. Nine months from now, probably. You know, there isn't there going to be a baby
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.240]   boom? I think in nine months, I have a feeling. I think so. I think, yeah. Definitely so.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.080]   Anyway, we're thrilled to have all three of you for people listening. The show shouldn't sound
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.240]   any different, but for people watching, the show is going to look a lot different. We've gone back
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.000]   to the old school way of doing things. I am because we don't want to bring in a bunch of staff. We've
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.480]   really gone down to a skeleton staff in the studios. About two or three weeks ago, we closed
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.640]   the studios to outside visitors, which I'm glad I did. I just wanted to protect our staff. And then
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:39.360]   last week, we decided to, during, you know, it was really kind of at the same time as California
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.800]   itself, or I guess the seven Bay Area counties were in the eighth, the eight Bay Area counties
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.080]   decided to do a shelter in place order. We sent everybody home. There is some staff has to come in.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.600]   John Jammerby, our studio engineer is here because he has to, you know, put tapes in the machine,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.120]   whatever it is he does that I don't know how to do. And then we, most of the editors are working at
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.600]   home. But I'm in my office at the studio because I've locked the door. Nobody can come in here.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.720]   And so this is, I think, a fairly safe place for me to be. And I'm switching the show as we used to
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.360]   way back in the cottage days, nine years ago, where I'm at my desk and we've got a monitor of the
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.240]   three guests in it. And I may be a little distracted because as Sam just told us on the radio show,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.280]   this is actually was a shocker that you are as bad a driver when you're using car
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.640]   player Android Auto, you're actually worse than if you were drunk.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:45.120]   Much, much worse. Yeah. A study that came out earlier this week from the UK, they took about
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.120]   40 drivers, 20 Android users, 20 iPhone users, put them in a simulator and had them run through a
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.600]   series of tasks while doing about a 15 minute drive and measured their reaction times and
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.520]   the amount of time that their eyes were gazing down at the screen. And they found that compared to
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:10.960]   when they did a study previously with drivers that had drank some alcohol and others that
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.480]   smoked marijuana, the results were significantly worse. Reaction times were
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:27.200]   53% slower when using the Android Touch Android Auto Touch Interface, 57% slower when using CarPlay
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:34.800]   Touch Interface. Slower than if you were drunk? Well, slower than the baseline. Oh, okay, slower than
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.680]   if you were unimpaired. But for the drivers that were drunk, it was only 12% slower. And those
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:49.280]   smoking marijuana were only 21% slower. So it was more than two and a half times worse than
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.040]   somebody smoking marijuana. Is it that people are reaching down and looking at the screen and
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.920]   reaching down and touching, they're taking their eyes off the road? Is that what it is?
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.680]   Yeah, it's a combination of looking away from the road, looking down at the screen. And this is
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.280]   one of the things that car makers have started to do in the last couple of years is new vehicle
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.600]   designs. They're actually putting the screen up higher up on top of the dash. So it looks more
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.320]   like a freestanding tablet on top of the dash. So it's not as far away from your normal line of
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.840]   sight when you're driving. But the other problem is, when you do have to reach out for a touch
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.760]   screen, reaching your arm out to hit a touch target, as you're driving down the road, your
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.520]   arm is cantilevered out there. So your finger is naturally going to tend to move around a little
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:40.320]   bit. So you have to put more cognitive effort in to actually stabilize your finger and hit that
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.680]   touch target. Then, for example, if you're using a little central controller, like a BMW iDrive type
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.840]   of controller or something like that, on the console or just twisting a knob. Wow. That's
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.600]   it would have done the usability testing for that. I mean, why did that? I don't know that till
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.160]   now. Well, I think we did kind of, right? I mean, I remember when we talked, we would go to talk to
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.720]   Ford back in the day when Ford Sync was an advertiser and their whole pitch was keep your eyes
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:12.400]   on the road, your hands on the wheel, talk to the system. They kind of knew that it was dangerous
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:20.560]   to touch it. But Sam, you didn't tell them the worst part. If you're talking on the phone with a
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:27.440]   hands-free. Yeah, even talking with a hands-free phone, it was still worse. The reaction times were
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.080]   still longer than if you're drinking or smoking marijuana. Just talking on the phone, looking at
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:42.560]   the road, hands on the wheel, just talking because you're really in two spaces. You can't concentrate
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.520]   as much on what you should be doing, which is driving. We should not be allowed to drive. I swear
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.560]   to God. It's always been known that even talking to somebody riding in the car with you,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.960]   takes some of your attention away from the road. Touch screens are the worst possible interface
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.320]   to have in a car. It's unfortunate that over the last decade, we've had this transition. Everybody's
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.880]   got their smartphones and everybody wants that same kind of interface in the car, but it's the worst
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.280]   possible interface to have in the car. Touch screens. It gives you any testing about your reaction
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:21.280]   times if you are drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, talking about it, and texting. They didn't have
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.200]   to worry about that. It's enough when you combine all of those things together. It actually gets better.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.840]   How that works, but how intuitive? It's why we got a push for self-driving cars. We're just
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.720]   terrible drivers. Yet, there are fewer highway deaths by a long shot than there happened in the car.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:45.120]   The progress we've made over the last 50 years since the mid-1960s, we've gone from about a
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:54.240]   fatality rate between 6.5 and 7 fatalities for every 100 million miles we drive to just over one.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:02.320]   We've reduced it by more than 75%. Almost 80% reduction in fatality rate in the last 50 years.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:12.560]   We have made tremendous progress. Actually, for all the 38,000 people a year die on the roads in the
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:20.000]   United States. When you consider we more, it used to be 50,000. It was a lot more than that. That was
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:30.800]   when we were driving a lot less. In the late 60s, we were driving about 900 billion miles a year.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:38.160]   Now, we're driving 3.2 trillion miles a year, and having fewer fatalities. We've made tremendous
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.080]   progress. They're still a long way to go. I think it's worse if they move the cheese. They start
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.720]   moving the UI around and people don't know where to look. Now, it gets worse. You have cheese in your
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.240]   car? No, I know what you're saying. You have to move the target. They can move the UX around.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:00.080]   People do that. Organizations do that, and you can't find stuff. You spend more time on the touchscreen.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:07.760]   That's actually one of the advantages of Android Auto RecarPlay versus an OEM, the factory systems,
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:14.080]   because those 10, they're obviously different from every manufacturer. At least if you're using
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.880]   Android Auto or CarPlay, it's consistent. If you have more than one car in your household that you
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.560]   drive on a regular basis, and you're using one of these smartphone projection systems,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:31.600]   at least it's going to be the same whichever car you get into. Testing that they've done versus
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.520]   manufacturer design systems. The Android Auto and CarPlay are better than those, but it's still a
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.720]   lot worse than nothing at all. One of the reasons that fatalities used to be so much higher
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.680]   is that distracted drivers have always existed. You were joking around about cheese in the car,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:53.280]   but in fact, people eat in the car while they're driving. I've seen people read the newspaper,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.600]   put it on their makeup using the rear mirror and stuff like that. People are, like you say,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.920]   we need self-driving cars ASAP because human beings cannot be trusted with a regular
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:11.600]   death machine like that. Porsche used to have this policy that they would not put cut holders
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.320]   in their cars. For a long time, they were one of the last manufacturers to put cup holders in
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:23.120]   their cars because they thought, why would anybody driving a Porsche want a cup holder in the car?
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.680]   Yeah, but then they put the cup between their legs and that's not good either.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.480]   So I think a cup holders, the best, and this is the same thing with CarPlay. If you don't put
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.400]   CarPlay in, they're going to pick up the phone and do it. My daughter, I didn't after her fourth
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.680]   accident, I said, you can't drive anymore, but she lately is needed to. So I said, okay, but the
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.120]   deal is you have to put your smartphone in the trunk before you get in the car. You cannot bring
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.880]   it into the cabin with you at all. But I still worry about her fiddling with it.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.520]   You have to go back to 100% manual transmissions with a clutch pedal.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.600]   This is the guy who drives a 20-year-old Miata, says we should go.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:12.560]   If you can't handle a clutch pedal and shifting for yourself, then you probably shouldn't be driving.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.040]   It's a good point. You were driving a lot more when you had to be in a gear and shift and do
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.360]   all that stuff. I used to have my... You remember my Mustang was a manual. And there's a lot of work.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.280]   I got tired of it. It's too much work to drive.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.760]   Prior to automatic secret, we never had sudden unintended acceleration incidents in cars.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.120]   We never had people misapplying to pedals when you had...
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.640]   You just strip the gears.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:44.880]   All right. This was a week. We did actually get some tech news. I am deathly afraid
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:52.480]   that as this lockdown continues over the next few weeks and possibly months, maybe who knows a year,
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.600]   there's going to be less and less tech news. I don't know, Lou, you work at Microsoft.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:04.160]   How much Google's already said, "We're not going to update Chrome or Chrome OS. Everybody's at home.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.520]   I don't know why they can't do that." But are you still working at home, right?
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.080]   Yeah, absolutely. I saw that comment on Windows Weekly. I was watching you guys
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.240]   were talking about that. The interesting thing here is that companies are updating.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   Microsoft is going to continue to update things. It's really not us. That's going to be the
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.880]   cause of it. We're working. We're doing everyday work. But we're worried about other businesses,
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.440]   right? The businesses that are working from home or not working at all. If we go and update
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.240]   things on them and things break, there's nobody there to fix them. I think that's one of the major
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:44.080]   problems, I think. I'm sorry, Leo. I just wrote a three-part series on what enterprises need to
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.800]   be thinking about it with the coronavirus. It's pretty rich material. But one of the things that I...
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.520]   One of the conclusions I came to is that it would be a huge mistake for large organizations of any
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.640]   kind, including enterprises, to back off on IT spending generally. They should be expecting
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:08.480]   to increase IT spending simply because a lot of what we're doing now is we're going from the
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.960]   physical to the virtual. We're spending a lot less on meetings and travel and all that stuff,
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.200]   and a little more on video conferencing. We're spending... We need to spend a lot more on security
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.600]   because this is the opportunity of a lifetime for cyber criminals because suddenly all of these
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:30.320]   people are working from home over insecure networks, with insecure equipment, and now is the time to
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.720]   get out those phishing attacks and everybody's nervous. The email is coming saying, "Well,
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.400]   here's a cure for the coronavirus," or "Here's your tax rebate for the coronavirus," and then people
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.600]   are working from home on their own personal equipment, which has not been secured by the company.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.360]   So I think in general, companies need to be thinking about cost containment in terms of spending more
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.520]   on IT and security and a lot less on everything else.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.120]   And let me be clear, too. We obviously are still putting out security patches. That's one of the
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.120]   most important things. In fact, on Twi, we actually covered a bunch of other things, just like Mike
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.160]   was saying, to make sure that you are doing the right thing and you're securing the right thing,
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.640]   make sure you have a MFA is turned on and people are using the right services, especially for remote
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.680]   workers, because that can leave a bunch of gaps. Like we said, your users the weakest link, so you
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.640]   need to make sure that they're all secured. It's funny, some businesses like ours are well
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:28.480]   prepared for this, right? You guys are always remote. And we've joked a lot about how most
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.680]   geeks are introverts, and for us, this is just business as usual. But what we do see is...
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.640]   I've been working at home since 2014. What's the difference? About half of my company,
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.800]   you know, about almost 6,000 employees, I think, have our remote workers.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.760]   Anyway. So it's not unusual. My company's been fairly well prepared for this.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.920]   But now we've got a lot of people who've never done this before, and there's a lot of pain.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.360]   Even watching the 24-hour news channels, Anderson Cooper self-isolated
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:06.640]   this week, and he's broadcasting from his house. He obviously CNN sent engineers over and set up
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.880]   a nice camera shot. There was well lit. They didn't have problems. But on the other hand,
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.600]   they've also been bringing a lot of people as we do via Skype. And every error that we've made
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.000]   over the years on Skype, I'm watching them go through the whole thing with Echo-E video out of
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   sync, lip sync. I saw somebody on MSNBC wearing the dreaded iPhone earbuds using the little microphone
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.320]   on that thing. And of course, just as, you know, when it happens to us, we say,
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.480]   "Get rid of that. Get on." Well, send your heads. We can think of a little
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.200]   scratching sound of the microphone against his collar. I'm hearing it. And I'm actually getting
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:52.000]   kind of a little bit of PTSD going, "Oh, they're using them. The eye. I can tell. He's using iPhones."
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.240]   And then they had a podcaster on. And just like all of us, they had a microphone in front of his face
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.880]   like this. I thought, "He's ready. He's prepared. We've been prepared for this for a very long time."
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:11.920]   It's interesting to hear. And I never thought about it, but this issue of security, we haven't
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:18.240]   heard a lot of, at least not rampant, ransomware attacks. In fact, it seems like it's kind of
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.360]   calmed down a little bit, Mike. But do you think that this is the calm before the storm?
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.960]   I do. In fact, I think that this is, I mean, several things are happening. One, it's an obvious
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:34.320]   opportunity for anybody who wants to, you know, do ransomware or any of that stuff.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.200]   Oh, I had somebody call me on the radio show saying, "It's chaos. It's a great opportunity for
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.520]   everybody. You know, they're all making this up." I went click, hung up on him. So that's not
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.280]   as irresponsible. It's wrong in so many ways. But yeah, of course, the creeps are going to go,
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:56.400]   "Hey, big opportunity." Well, I mean, think about the whole world. So some countries are ahead.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.480]   Everybody's following a similar trajectory. So like China was number one, then Italy and
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.960]   Europe and now the US and then Mexico and so on and eventually Africa and all over. This is
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.560]   spreading worldwide and it's going to take months and years for this to spread around.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:16.000]   Everybody have their first wave, but it's going to leave recession and economic downturn and layoffs
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.800]   in its wake everywhere it goes. And so there's going to be a lot more cyber criminals as well,
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   because there's going to be a lot of people scrounging around looking for ways to make income.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:36.400]   And so this is, it would be foolish to not expect a huge tsunami of new types of cyber attacks
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.480]   trying to exploit this opportunity. Yeah, that's a terrifying thought.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.800]   And then Apple, which closed all of its stores worldwide, which was wild, right? I mean,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.000]   yeah, we're just going to, and then first they said for a week or two,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.320]   we're at the China, except for China where they reopen them, which is even weirder.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.360]   But I guess China is ahead of the curve. So we know how long it'll take to get the stores
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.600]   reopened and now it's new products this week. We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.000]   I want to take a little break. Samable, Sam it is here. He is principal researcher at Navigants.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.720]   Great to have you say this is so weird for me. I'm back in my office and I can see all three of you
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.000]   over my shoulder. Sam is a principal researcher at Navigant Research, Wheel bearings.media for his
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.400]   podcast, Mike Elgin at Elgin.com. Are your gastronomat trips? I guess you're going to put those on hold
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:33.040]   until things clear up. We're trying to postpone them as late as possible. So we did postpone the
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.200]   Morocco experience, which was going to be next month. That's going to happen in October.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:44.240]   The next one is the Provence experience in late June and early July. Don't know about that one.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.160]   So we'll probably have to postpone that, but we'll see. Hopefully we won't have to. Chris
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:54.080]   Markwart is our photo guy, does photo workshops all over the world. He was in Ethiopia,
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.440]   got sent home by the German embassy. They said, "You're going home. The whole
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:04.080]   thing's canceled." And he has a whole slate of upcoming trips that are on hold. I mean, it's
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.160]   very difficult. Everybody's going through tough times. And then Lou Mareska has to stay home with
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:16.720]   four small children. Are they used to having you work at home, Lou? I used to work from home on
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.840]   Fridays. I used to do parental leave with my kids. I used to stay on Fridays. So I used to have
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.320]   a pretty good zone here that I've set up. And so they're used to seeing me here. So they stay
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.360]   away most of them. And I have this great equipment that I have to worry about if they're running
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.760]   around making noise. I'm not too much. Yeah, I don't hear a thing. It could be screaming,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.880]   "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!" I used to... They go right now. I've always had a home office. And when my
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   kids were little, they would know I was in there. They would pound on the door. So let me in.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.560]   Once a while, you'll get my two-year-old, her run up and one a hug. So you might be seeing me
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.400]   bend down a couple of times. I think that's great. In fact, in some ways, I mean, look,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:25:00.800]   there's going to be some... Millions are going to die. It's a disaster, but their economic disaster
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.600]   we're going to go into a recession, or maybe depression. But there are some benefits to this,
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.960]   a little more family time. I think we're also going to... It's interesting. We watched a
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:17.920]   first-run movie last night. We watched The Hunt last night, which was going to be released last
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.240]   September, then due to gun violence, couldn't be. And they were going to release it now. And
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:28.000]   there's a bunch of movies that Paramount and others are putting out now. $20 rental, which is a
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.520]   little weird. But if you think it's still less than the movie ticket, and I wonder if that means...
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.240]   So here's... There's two ways it could go when this is all over. Either people will be so anxious to
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:45.440]   get back to normalcy and being around people that the theaters will boom, or we may realize,
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.520]   "Hey, we don't really need these. This worked out fine. Let's just stay home. It could be the end
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:55.760]   of movie theaters." I suspect it's probably going to be more of the former, but I hope it's going to
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:02.720]   be really interesting to watch, with so many people working at home now. A lot of companies in the
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:08.640]   past have been reluctant to let people work remotely. And I think with this, with what's going on right
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:17.360]   now, this is the biggest mass experiment in remote working ever. And if it actually works out for a
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   lot of companies, I could see a lot of companies actually making this permanent for at least some
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:31.920]   portion of their workforce, which if they do that, there's obviously a cascading downside to that
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:39.040]   for a lot of the people that work in various services to support those people, people in restaurants
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:46.720]   and bars around downtown areas where they work. But it could also have some significant environmental
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.160]   benefits, because if suddenly a significant portion of people that were commuting are no longer
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.440]   commuting, that reduces the amount of the amount of miles they have to drive. Pollution is down,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:03.840]   traffic is down, improves their quality. And it could actually end up having more of an impact
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.760]   on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change than all of the other technological things we've
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.720]   been trying to do. And Sam, I think you're right that there's going to be a lot of
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.520]   people not wanting to go back to work, especially IT people, but lots of people.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.720]   I mean, we were into a kind of permanent shift toward homework or a great leap forward toward
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:30.480]   homework, I think. But in terms of movie theaters, I think the movie theater, I think movie theaters
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.840]   are going to become rare, because we're talking about 18 months before we have a vaccine and then
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.320]   how long before everybody gets it and all that kind of stuff. I mean, I don't think theaters can last
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:48.240]   three months, let alone two years without lots of people going. And so I think they're going to be
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   lots and lots of closures. I think if a town has 10 movie theaters right now,
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.760]   I think at the end of this, they may have one. So I mean, it's going to be like really,
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.080]   it doesn't exist, but they'll be rare. It's probably all they needed, however.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:08.960]   Yeah. So definitely be fewer screens, fewer, but maybe with an improved user experience,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.640]   moving more towards some of these theaters where you have the nice reclining seats,
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.480]   food service, making it a better customer experience. It'll be like,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.440]   a few ones upon a time, yeah, once upon a time stage plays was how everybody got entertained
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.440]   after movies came out, they still exist, but they're kind of like for richer people and like,
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:33.120]   that sort of thing. Isn't that funny? Movies, they're only for the wealth theory.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.400]   Yes. And then school is going to change to education. My son has been an online school
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.200]   through high school in California because we have charter schools there, Pearson, the big
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:49.280]   educational publisher. This may be true in other states too, has they call it Connections Academy.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.240]   It's an online school. It's free. It's a public school because they get paid by the state per
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:00.880]   pupil just as the public schools do because of this charter school's bill. And he's actually
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.720]   used to it likes it. His schooling hasn't changed at all. And I wonder if this might also be a
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:14.560]   sea change for how we educate. I think so. I think it will. I mean, I think it absolutely will.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.960]   You know, Kevin's got chatterbox. It's a smart speaker for kids. It's over your shoulder right
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:28.400]   now. I see it. Yes. Yes. He's seeing a run on these things because kids are home. They're not
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   supposed to go outside necessarily. They got nothing to do. And so the chatterbox is an opportunity
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.600]   for them to have a big project. It takes a lot of time. It's very educational. So the chatterbox
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:46.800]   is available online at Hello, chatterbox.com. Yeah, I did. Sorry. No, no, but that's exactly right.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:54.000]   I would imagine Raspberry Pi's science kits. You know, we've been talking about EDX and other
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.120]   online schools. You could, you know, if a kid's out of school, he can take Harvard's CS50 computer
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:05.680]   science course. I mean, there's honestly, this would have been a very different scene 20, 50 years ago.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:13.760]   But in a way, it's almost as if this we were planning for this. In some ways, in other ways,
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.440]   we weren't planning for it at all, obviously. But as far as education and online education
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.360]   goes, this is going to, I think, has to be a boom. We're all fairly old, except for Lou.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:32.000]   And like, imagine if this happened in the 70s. Oh, yeah. I mean, there was no home working
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.160]   at home because they're the 80s or the 90s. There was no way for people to work from home.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.680]   There was nothing could be an electronic. There was no video conferencing. I mean,
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.920]   I it's hard to imagine what would have happened. And we're not putting a gloss on this thing,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.440]   isn't this great? It's obviously awful. But yes, I mean, it's very obviously awful for everybody
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:55.360]   in every respect. But I do think the world will change coming out of this in ways that may not be
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.320]   awful. They may. I mean, the interesting things we're always talking about trends on the show.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:07.840]   I'm sorry. We're always talking about trends on the show. And this is a radical set of the
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.040]   trends that we've been talking about. So this is going to accelerate all the move,
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.240]   everything to digital, work from home, all those kinds of things. They're all being
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:19.360]   accelerated. Many other things are being decelerated. But but in tech, tech is being
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:26.400]   accelerated. One of our chatter says, the drive in movie is going to come back. So we get all
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.280]   sits sealed in our car. Good idea. Lou, what were you going to say?
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.040]   No, I was going to say you'll help companies start to gravitate more towards the online learning.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   Like YouTube is starting to curate things themselves rather than let everyone else curate it for you
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   and produce content. You're starting to see that more and you're going to see more and more
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.360]   companies actually curate these things and put out programs because they have the facilities to
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:49.120]   do it. They have the content to do it. Why don't they actually start to do it?
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.480]   We're going to take a little break. There is a apparently Apple decided to release something.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.920]   I don't know. There is a new product or two. We'll talk about that in just a little bit. But first
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:05.600]   a word from our friends at Mint Mobile, they have done something really, really exciting,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:11.360]   really remarkable. They have, we've been talking about them for a while. They're an MVNO. That is
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.880]   they resell T-Mobile connections. You get the T-Mobile connection at a really low price
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:24.480]   as little as $15 for their introductory three-month plan. That's $15 for unlimited nationwide talk
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.560]   and text and three gigabytes of data. I actually liked it so much. I got the Mint Mobile Sim,
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:37.600]   put it in a phone. I had it in the OnePlus 7T. I liked it so much. I said, "Well, I'm going to do
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:44.160]   the year package, 300 bucks, $300, $25 a month, $25 a month for unlimited text,
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.760]   unlimited nationwide talk, 12 gigabytes a month. It's the best deal in sell out there."
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.720]   And I'm a T-Mobile customer. So it's exactly the same service I was paying for and a lot less money.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.600]   I think this is really great. They are stepping up. They're giving unlimited free,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:06.400]   unlimited data for all. It started March 15th. It goes through April 14th. All current and new
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:12.560]   customers if you sign up today with free unlimited high-speed data add-ons. So I mentioned three
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.920]   gigabytes, 12 gigabytes during this tough time when we're all needing the bandwidth maybe to work
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:24.160]   at home or just to watch movies unlimited. You can go to mintmobile.com/unlimited to learn more about
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:31.120]   that. If you're not a Mint Mobile customer, now's the time. They save money by not having stores,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   by being entirely online. They pass the savings on to you. Every plan comes with unlimited
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.440]   nationwide talk and text. Crazy fast 4G LTE. It's the same LTE you'd get if you're a T-Mobile
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.760]   customer. You can bring your own phone. They do cell phones, but in most cases, people can bring
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.200]   their own phones. You can take your phone number with you too. It's yours. You can port it right
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   over to Mint Mobile. All your contacts, everything come right over. And of course, if you're not 100%
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:03.360]   satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered with their seven-day money-back guarantee. Now's the time.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.840]   To get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month with their three-month introductory plan
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:15.520]   and get the plan shipped to your door free, mintmobile.com/twit. Mintmobile.com/twit. Cut your
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:21.840]   wireless bill to as little as $15 a month. I'm 25 bucks is a third what I was paying
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:28.880]   for the same exact service. And now through April 14th, there's no cap, no limits. Thank you,

[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:55.040]   Cartoon from Nitrazak and Snaggy the Joy of Tech. Wow. Did you see the new iPad with the new
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:02.480]   backlit magic keyboard and light our scanner? Oh, you make me so mad. OMG, it is a faster 812Z
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:07.040]   bionic chip and ultra-wide camera. How can you possibly care about this stuff when the whole world
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:12.880]   is crashing in on itself and millions may die and our life is out. We know it is over because I
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:18.240]   understand there's a crisis and we all have to do our part to get through this. But I'm still a geek
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.200]   and I love it when there's some amazing new hardware. You really know how to throw cold water
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:33.040]   in a pandemic, don't you? So it's got Lidar. By the way, who was it? I think it was Stacy Higginbotham
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.360]   who said, it doesn't really have Lidar. At least not. Oh, I'm not so sure. Is it Lidar? It's
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.920]   she said it's a time of flight sensor. We're talking about the new iPad Pro. Well, that's what
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.040]   most Lidar is. The vast majority of Lidar sensors are time of flight sensors. Because
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:59.600]   all Lidar is it's a sensor that uses laser emitter and photo sensors to measure distance to an object.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.680]   You know, measure the time it takes for the photons to bounce off and come back. Lidar
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.720]   stands for light detection and ranging. So it's just like a bat's sonar. But instead of sound,
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:16.080]   it's using photons. Right. So it's obviously a lot faster than sound. But the I don't think
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:22.240]   I'm going to guess that the new iPad doesn't actually have a laser in there. Actually, it probably does.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:30.880]   What? A low power probably a 905 nanometer laser emitter. Okay. And okay. You know, what it is.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.120]   There's a lot of different types of Lidar. You know, the ones you see on the roof of the
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.880]   automated. The spinning ones, but they're doing 3D 360 degree. Right. So those those have an array
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.520]   of Lidar emitters and it rotates around and scans as it drives down the road. So it gives you a
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:51.360]   360 degree field of view. But there's other kinds that are, you know, solid state that use a MEMS
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:59.280]   mirror system like a DLP basically to do beam steering from the from the emitter.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.800]   And then there's also something called flash Lidar, which is a very low cost Lidar. And what it does,
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:14.720]   it can use one or just a few emitters and it pulses through a diffuser and then has just an array of
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.520]   photosensors. So it's, you know, kind of like a camera sensor, like an imaging sensor, but it's
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:26.640]   tuned for the Lidar frequency from 905 nanometers. And what that does, there's no moving parts at
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:32.240]   all. But because it's diffusing 1 emitter through the, you know, through this diffuser,
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.680]   you're spreading out the photons. So you have a lot less range. And they say this Lidar sensor on the
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:44.320]   the iPad is only got about a 5 meter range. So I'm pretty sure that's pretty distant.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:50.480]   Yeah. Yeah. And it's fine for what it's what it's designed for. You know, so it's a laser emitter
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.920]   going through a diffuser. And then you've got a sensor set that's generating a point cloud.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   And the idea is it's really for all, by the way, this is the website.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.080]   Obviously this was designed before the work at Home orders, because somebody for a lot of
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.480]   work it is. But what they're clearly going to use it for is augmented reality. In fact,
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.160]   they've showed videos, the guy who did the lava game for Apple Arcade. That would be kind of cool.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.240]   You know, where the carpets lava and the furnace, your kids probably play this
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.640]   Lou, the, you know, the furniture's your island of sanity and you jump trying to avoid the lava.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.920]   Well, in the hot lava game, you're in a world and you're doing that. But now you can make it
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:37.280]   your living room. You hold up the iPad and you'll see the lava. You'll see the furniture. You're
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:44.480]   not jumping. A little man is jumping. But, but I don't, I mean, it seems gimmicky to me. I don't
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:51.520]   want to. It's all for hours at a time. He's given, he's given developers a path towards the
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:57.360]   glasses that are going to come. Originally in 2022, probably now delayed to 23 or 24. But
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.880]   the Apple augmented reality glasses are definitely coming and all this stuff is going to make
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:08.080]   incredible sense. But they're going to want developers are going to want games, they're going to want
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.200]   all kinds of applications in place by the time they come out with these devices. And this is
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:19.440]   clearly a gateway drug to the eyeglasses of the future. Yeah. It was a missing piece of the puzzle
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.560]   because the HoloLens actually has the flash time of flight depth sensor already the LiDAR sensor.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.480]   So, you know, now you're talking about getting closer to those types of capabilities, which
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.800]   actually gives another tool in the toolbox for developers, for sure. Apple bought the Israeli
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:40.000]   company PrimeSense that made the connect depth sensor. So Microsoft no longer has access to that.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.320]   But Apple does. I would guess that there are kissing cousins between that and the whole.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.360]   And there's a bunch of other companies that are doing flash light hours well. So, it's not
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:55.280]   that uncommon. That was an aqua hire. They want those people who have been working on that stuff
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.560]   for the future of their augmented reality for sure. So, I thought though, the most interesting
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.880]   part of this announcement, besides the fact that they announced products they can't sell in stores.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   But I guess they'll sell. I mean, I bought both. I guess there are people.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:15.200]   Sheeple like me who will buy it no matter what. But I thought the most interesting thing was the
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:23.040]   ad copy that basically said your next computer is not a computer. It said it's a magical piece
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:29.360]   of glass. Okay, you can drop the everything's magic now, Apple. Everything. So fast, most
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:35.680]   PC laptops can't catch up. That's that new A12Z bionic chip, which admittedly Apple makes a
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:42.000]   amazing silicon. The problem is their silicon platform is ARM, not x86. They have a little bit
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.680]   of a problem, which is they have basically ARM, iOS, touch, and then non-touch Intel.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.040]   They also released a new Intel product, the MacBook Air, which is easily their most popular
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:00.800]   computer, their best-selling computer. That has the new 10th generation Intel Core.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.040]   They're using the Y, not the U processor. So it's the mobile, slower mobile part.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:11.440]   I seems to me what I see here is a very, we've wondered what is Apple's plan.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:18.080]   When it comes to ARM versus Intel, when it comes to computing in general, for a long time,
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   they've said the iPad is a computer that's not a computer. I think now there's a clear path,
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.960]   because the big announcement isn't so much that iPad Pro. It's this, yes, it's magic.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.800]   That's new magic keyboard with a trackpad on it. A cantilever design that raises,
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.880]   it's really an interesting design. In fact, somebody tweeted, I think it was you, Luke,
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.440]   tweeted that this is interesting comparing it to the surface.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:53.680]   It is. I mean, did the 201 designs been around for a while? But I think one of the biggest things
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:00.320]   is the fact that they are changing the interactions to be a little different than, let's say, a surface,
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:04.640]   because they're allowing you to still feel like you're touching the device,
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.280]   rather than from the touchpad. So that interaction, user experience is almost
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:14.000]   a game changer. It might actually shift other technology companies to do the same thing, I think.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.040]   Yeah. I mean, it's really interesting, because I also think it makes clearer Apple's roadmap.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.840]   There was a lot of talk, maybe this is going to still happen, but there's a lot of talk about,
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.480]   oh, when are they going to make all their computers arm based and take advantage of their custom
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:35.120]   silicon? Now, I think it's a little clearer that when Steve Jobs said, well, people always need to
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:43.120]   drive trucks, that the x86 stuff will continue for people who need computing, video editors,
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:49.680]   car designers, probably developers. But I think they're visually.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:58.080]   Brownly, Marquez Brownly, and his 8K workflow. But there are still most people who use computers
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:05.920]   don't need that. And the iPad, especially with this keyboard, the trackpad, the attractive touch
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.640]   for his interface might be the computer for the rest of us. There's still a problem, though,
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.600]   and this is the one that Apple's going to have to dress head on before they can
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.080]   make this vision a reality. I really think they're really now saying we're going to have two
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.280]   roads. We're going to have the consumer road. We're going to have the pro road.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.200]   The trucks will be x86. I don't think they're going to bother with arm. That was going to be
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.360]   a painful transition. We'll keep doing arm and iOS for the rest of us. The problem is Apple screwed
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:37.840]   the pooch a little bit. And I think you've said this, Mike Elgin, with iOS apps. They set a standard
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:44.480]   of bar for the price of iOS apps, 99 cents, five bucks, maybe, maybe 10 or 20 bucks.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.880]   That no one's going to develop professional apps for the iOS platform because they can't,
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:56.800]   there's just no money in it. And that's what's missing right now. The iPad's fantastic,
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:03.360]   amazing processor, great cameras. It's got, you know, LiDAR, it's got this, I think there's new
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:09.280]   keyboard and the trackpad solves the last little usability issue, but they still don't have the
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:17.040]   software. That's right. In general, and across the board, you see Apple devolving into an ordinary
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   company. It was an extraordinary company between two, you know, whenever Jobs rejoined it, launched
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:30.240]   the iPod in 2001 all the way through until his death. And since then, they've been devolving back
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:38.400]   to a normal company. You still still see them coasting on Jobs over simplicity. I love how
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:44.160]   stupid this is to call it a magical piece of glass. That's what Steve Jobs called the iPad when
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.720]   it was just a magical piece of glass. Now it's a magical piece of glass. It's a magical piece of
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:53.360]   plastic in the form of the pencil. It's a magical piece of vinyl that goes around for the keyboard
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.480]   and the trackpad. Everything's magic. All the materials are magic. The recycled aluminum also magic.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.280]   It's really, it's really dumb what they're doing, what essentially what they're doing.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.120]   You think this is dumb? You think this is a mistake?
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:11.920]   I think it's dumb. Well, wait a minute, I really want this iPad and the keyboard and the trackpad
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.280]   and all that stuff. Yeah, because you of all people, you, you, your mobile platform is an iPad with
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:23.120]   a keyboard. I use, I use an iPad and I also use a pixel book. So I go back and forth depending on
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:29.360]   what I'm doing, but I do my writing, my main work on the iPad and I use an Apple Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.440]   If this is a great keyboard, I would love this keyboard. I prefer it because it's attached. But
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.960]   my point is that essentially what Steve Jobs used to enforce is there's one phone you should buy.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:46.240]   There's one laptop you should buy. He always had this obsession with simplicity, with singularity.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.720]   And now Apple's just like, well, it has this, it has that. Everything has everything. And I don't
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:57.760]   really think it's reasonable to assume that they have a very clear, bradgy.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.040]   Fact is they have to keep growing revenue from base where they are. They're a trillion plus
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.480]   company right now and they have to keep growing. So how do they do that? Right now,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.520]   they're discounting things to do all kinds of very unapply things. Meanwhile, they're doing also
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:18.080]   Apple-y things. They're kind of doing both. So I think that what they're really looking, I think
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:23.680]   there are three things that are going to enable them to survive in the future. Their car,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:29.440]   their financial services and their glasses, but it's not clear to them exactly how they're
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.680]   going to make a lot of money from that. In the meantime, they're trying to,
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.600]   they're trying to prep us for that world. They're trying to continue to serve the faithful.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:48.560]   And things like little problems like, does the iPad compete with the laptops? That's an issue,
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.960]   but I don't think that's top of mind for them. They're trying to sell anything to anyone
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:59.120]   and keep selling these things until they can get to this future where basically smartphones
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.520]   aren't even the main device. I think that's coming in five, 10 years where it's going to be glasses
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:08.800]   and other devices, embedded systems and so on. But right now, they're just, I really don't think
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.480]   they know where they're going in the future, but in the meantime, they want to sell as much
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.120]   of this stuff as possible. And one of the hints is, look at how expensive this keyboard and trackpad
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.080]   they are. Well, you're paying laptop prices. The keyboard is unbelievable. If you buy the 12.9
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:27.680]   inch iPad, it starts at 1,000. The same price, by the way, is the MacBook Air with a keyboard.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.440]   If you want to add the keyboard for the 12.9 inch, it's $345. If you had a decent amount of storage,
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:38.400]   suddenly you've got a laptop price, maybe even more. But I do-- Yeah, but the MacBook
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.640]   Air screen doesn't float. Yeah. But it doesn't have touch, it doesn't have the pencil.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:48.960]   I don't know. I think they're strategy. I disagree with you, Mike. If you'd asked me two weeks ago,
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:54.560]   I would have said that. But I think they're actually showing a clear strategy for the next
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:48:01.680]   generation of compute. And Microsoft said this for a while, Lou. I mean, touch. But Microsoft,
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:08.640]   their problem was they didn't have iOS and desktop OS. They had one OS. And so they
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:15.840]   shoot-- and forgive me, but they unsuccessfully tried to shoehorn a tablet OS into the desktop OS.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:22.080]   That was Windows 8. That was such a terrible-- That was a terrible solution. They backed off on
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:29.280]   that. But the surface is kind of that. And I think the duo and the Neo will be also this kind of next
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:36.000]   generation of computing. I honestly think, Mike, it's funny coming from you because you're the
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.120]   guy sitting there with the iPad at the coffee shop. But I think with this cantilever keyboard,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:48.560]   a trackpad, if they could only get pro-level software on this iPad, I think this is the future
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:57.040]   of computing. Lou, what do you think? The divide is the software. I think that's where they're
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.760]   running short on. If you look at it, any other device that's touched doesn't have to be a Microsoft
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.160]   device is around similar pricing. And you get the full gamut of enterprise software that comes along
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.360]   with it. And these are offlineable type software. They do not require VDI or anything like that.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.400]   You have to be online. So I think that once they get closer, once they bridge that divide,
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.680]   they will start to get more people on it. And they're trying. They've upgraded some of their
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:26.400]   own packages to be more efficient with the touchpad and to make it more integrated with it. And that
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.960]   will kind of force other applications that are already on the iPad to do that as well. And so
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.320]   they'll start to bridge it a little bit more. But I think you're right. There's some professional
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:40.640]   applications you just can't do. You can't develop on the iPad. You can't do really serious editing
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.080]   and video editing on the iPad. But that's only because nobody's put out those things.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.720]   That's right. That's right. And they do have a trackpad.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:54.240]   It's got a T. They have the T inverted T for the arrow keys. I mean, they're doing it. This
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:01.200]   looks like a real keyboard for a change. The trackpad is not a great trackpad. It's a circle that
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.000]   goes around. And I've used the mouse support that they had with the previous iPad. And that
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.320]   was just like unusable almost. It's not a precise, pointy device of the kind that professionals would
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:18.880]   need, developers, graphics designers and so on. They need much better tools in terms of a
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:25.200]   pointy device than this. Have you looked at the Crayc Federighi? I'm in isolation, but let me make
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:32.160]   a video on how the mouse works. You like this? This is good. This is the Brady patch version of the show.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:37.200]   Hi, Mike. Did you see Crayc Federighi's video?
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:44.160]   Because I thought that looked pretty good. Here's, I mean, at least they're thinking.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:49.040]   So the mouse is not a point, an arrow, which is, if you think about it, kind of
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:51:00.640]   anti-diluvian, how can I make a turn of phrase? It's anti-diluvian skeuomorphism to have this arrow
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:06.960]   head, right? What they turn it into is a round circle, like what your finger would look like,
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:13.120]   until it goes over a button, and then it expands to cover the button. So you know exactly what that
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.120]   click is going to do. It's the button. And then when it goes through it, it used to call it a ghost
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:25.200]   finger. Ghost finger. And then the ghost finger turns into a, a bond move, ghost finger. And then
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:30.880]   it turns into a, you know, one of the traditional editing caret when you're over text. I feels like
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:37.600]   it's, it's as if they, they kind of threw out the, the traditions and said, let's see what,
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.400]   what we could do. I'm, I've, I want, watch that video, because it really kind of made me feel like,
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.440]   oh, maybe they really have thought this out. But again, the lack, if you don't, if you don't have,
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.080]   you know, and I don't know why they don't, because they make Final Cut, but if you don't have a
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.880]   Final Cut class editor, maybe they, maybe they're working on that. If you don't have, they have
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.560]   pages, they have a word processor. Actually, Microsoft does the best touch first
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.640]   word processor offices on the iPad. So that's, I guess, good enough.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.200]   And so the user experience will have to change just like they've done with, you know, the
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.440]   ad track pass support and they know now you get more use of the this and so it'll, it'll actually
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:19.360]   have to change all the software. I, I'm, you know, as usual with Apple, I live a little bit in the
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:25.440]   reality distortion field until the products come. The iPad is shipping now. And the
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:32.560]   magic keyboard, the cantilevered magic keyboard will come out in May. It's going to look like a
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:38.800]   real laptop because it's even got a type C connector on the, on the hinge there. So if you sit at
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.920]   the coffee shop, they're not going to laugh at you anymore, Mike. They're going to say, oh, he's
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:47.680]   got a real computer. They'll find some way to laugh at me. They'll just do the coffee shop.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   I'm probably overexcited. I also ordered the Mac book air. Here they did an interesting thing.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:03.440]   They dropped the price significantly. The entry level Mac book air from 2018 was 1299, if I remember
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:11.040]   correctly, maybe it was 1200. It is now 999 education 899. They put modern chips in it. They,
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:17.760]   they put finally replaced that crap keyboard with the same keyboard that's on the 16 inch
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.840]   Mac book pro, which gives us that kind of an indicator that that's going to be the future of Mac
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:29.120]   laptop keyboards. What else did they do? It's a, otherwise it's pretty much storage.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:33.760]   They added some options for CPUs and storage options. Oh, that's right. The last,
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   you could only get one CPU. Yeah, that's right. And now you've got i3, i5 and i7 options. And
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:48.640]   the mid range one, it seems like the sweet spot. In fact, back in 2016, or whenever it was that
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:55.840]   they launched the previous Mac book pros with the terrible keyboard, I was looking for a new
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.880]   laptop at the time. And I went and tried one of those out and I could not deal with it.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:08.480]   And so I ended up buying a Windows machine. And when probably later this year, once things
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:16.400]   settle down, I'll probably go back and replace that now. It's getting on in years and replace
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:23.440]   that with one of these MacBook errors. Because it looks really nice. It's gold too. They have a gold.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:32.080]   Although not integral. The best color is the Surface Laptop. What do they call that? Cabernet.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.800]   Oh yeah, the right, the right, the right. Yeah. Micah has the deal. I do like the blue on the
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.640]   Surface Laptop. Yeah, that's the one Micah has. I call it like it has. Yeah, blue suede shoes. I
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:48.080]   call it Elvis. All right, well, it's interesting to see Apple. We were last week saying, well,
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.720]   because the rumor was they were going to do this. On the one hand, you don't have a store that
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.160]   people can go and look at it. And then on the other hand, you're losing so much revenue with
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.120]   the store's closing. Maybe this is a chance to read a goop with a new product. I think there's
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:04.880]   a lot of people like me that would buy it site unseen because we all kind of know what the
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.920]   iPad is like. We know what the MacBook Air is like. We know what that keyboard,
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.200]   I know what that keyboard is like, the improved keyboard. It's still not great,
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:20.960]   but it's better than it was. It's usable. Anyway, I'm just grateful to Apple for making some news.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:28.880]   Otherwise, it'd be the COVID-19 show nonstop. And nobody wants to do that.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:37.040]   And again, Apple is so well situated for anything. They can close their stores and they have a
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:43.280]   really high quality online store for anybody who wants to buy this stuff. So they're very
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:48.720]   well situated. It's going to be costly for them, obviously. But the malls are closing,
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:55.360]   the Apple stores are closing. So they're going to be online for the foreseeable future outside
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:02.480]   of China. I don't want to poke a sore spot, Lou, but did you see Steven Sinofsky's
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:08.000]   tweet thread about the new? I did. I follow him all the time because he has these really
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.320]   interesting things to say. Even though he no longer works at Microsoft, he still does
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.760]   really interesting historical things. And I did see his tweet about the form factor. And he's also
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.520]   excited just like you are. I think he's like, you know what? They took this thing and they
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.920]   innovated on it. They changed it from a new form factor to a existing form factor. And they added
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.320]   a bunch of functionality to it. And now it'll ship the market. I think he's right. I think that's
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.600]   what's going to actually happen. He says, like software, hardware evolves. We don't usually see
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:41.760]   it because we're very aware of software evolution. He says every new generation of hardware begins
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:49.840]   this cycle of redesign, bundling and unbundling again. We're used to adding to hardware, adding
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.600]   ports or absorbing new technologies over time. But where things get really interesting with
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:00.080]   hardware is when a new form is introduced. Often the first step is jet-asening many features from
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:09.440]   the leader. Yeah, he's as bullish about this as I am. So, and it's interesting that once he left
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:16.560]   Microsoft kind of under a dark cloud because he was Mr. Windows 8, right? He was Windows 8, right?
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.760]   Yeah, but he had things under him too. I mean, I'll look back on him. He's a smart guy,
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.000]   right? Yeah, he's got his legacy. And I think once he was able to talk about things besides
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.120]   Microsoft, he's become a very interesting, certainly provocative commentator.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:36.800]   You can talk about innovation in tablets and talking about Microsoft without mentioning
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:41.760]   the Surface Duo because this is the, you know, who knows if it's going to be a dog of a system
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:48.720]   or a great phone slash tablet slash thing. But the form factor to me, this is the form factor I've
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:54.880]   been waiting for for a decade. I mean, this is such a beautiful form factor that have no flexible
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:00.000]   glass BS, just like a two screen thing that opens up into it. There's a phone and then it opens up
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.320]   into a tablet. That's a great form factor, no matter what anybody says. So there's the Duo,
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:13.280]   which is an Android, it's a phone. I know they said it's not a phone. It's an Android two screen
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:20.080]   phone sized non phone. And then the NIO, which is running this, I'm fascinated by it. And I don't
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:23.520]   want to put you on the spot, Lou. I know you can't talk about we talk about on Windows Weekly all
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:30.480]   the time running this new version of Windows, Windows 10 X, right? Which to me, and again,
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   Lou, you could just tug your ear if I'm right. To me, what Microsoft really is doing, and this is
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:46.240]   long overdue, is redesigning Windows, Windows, like every operating system, it's become spaghetti.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:52.560]   They're constantly on top of a top of a top of a top of it much needed, I think, a rethinking.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.800]   And what's really interesting about Windows 10 X, it's containerized. Everything is in its own
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.960]   container. There's still the way containers work, unlike virtual machines, which are an entire
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:07.280]   operating system, applications, everything, the whole, the whole thing is in that ball.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:12.000]   A container is lighter weight because there's still an operating system layer that is common
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:18.560]   to all containers, but they're isolated somehow. And I think for the future of technology,
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:25.680]   the future of security, and the future probably of flexibility and robustness,
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:31.520]   containerizing Windows sounds very intriguing. And Microsoft was smart about this because instead
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.960]   of saying, "Oh, we got a whole new version of Windows and scaring the hell out of everybody,"
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.400]   they said, "We're designing a version of Windows for this special new hardware,
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:47.280]   this Neo2 screen device." But of course, they've also kind of implied that's just the beginning,
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:52.320]   and I feel like that's what's happening. And by hiding it behind this two screen device.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.240]   So like you, Mike, I'm very excited. I think this is an interesting. Is there...
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.880]   Somebody, a little bird told me that you might have seen one of these once, Lou.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:07.600]   So, you know, a lot of people at our company, they're self-hosting these devices, which means
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.360]   that you can take it out into the wild, use it. That's why you see videos online to people. And
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:17.680]   it's not, you know, it's not a secret. I can tell you I've touched it, used it. It's a fabulous,
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:23.920]   fabulous device. It feels great in the hand. It's very slippery, but it feels great. And even
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:29.680]   just the mobile device that you're talking about, the Duo, it's interesting because you can use it,
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.240]   you know, open, completely open, completely closed. You can leave it in your pocket open if you want,
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.640]   like a real cell phone and it's has facilities and systems to handle that. So yeah, I'm excited.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.640]   I mean, obviously, we had the Windows Mobile fiasco. I guess you could call it. And I really
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.120]   love Windows Mobile, but it just didn't go anywhere. And this is just another chance
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:55.040]   for them to show them that they really know how to do mobile, really know how to do devices,
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.080]   and using an ecosystem that's already developed, like Android, right? So I think it's definitely a
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.640]   way to go for sure. Who would have thought we'd say that the mobile and devices better?
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:11.120]   It's not the people. Say that again, Mike. It got cut off. Just don't use the P-word, the P-H-O-N-E
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.600]   word. And by the way, just quickly, if you ever want to leave one of those prototype units in
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:22.480]   bars somewhere, just let me know what bar and when and when I can pick it up. Yeah, I'm very
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.800]   excited. I will be first in line to buy one of those because I don't think the fold, I think we
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:37.120]   can all agree the folding screens have not proven to be very good. And so maybe they push the
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.880]   technology. I don't know. But the idea of two different screens that are related, but not the
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:50.160]   same, is there a big bezel between the two? Are they really kind of separated or are they
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.160]   look like they're almost together? No, it's a small bezel there.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.720]   Yeah, there's a small bezel. Yeah. Yeah. And the hinge technology is like,
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:04.000]   Microsoft's really great at hinges, for some reason. I don't know if you remember this,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.680]   Leo, but the one laptop per child project had a prototype two-screen laptop and it was supposed
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.200]   to be for kids in the developing world and so on. But the vision for that was so breathtaking
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.680]   that I never quite got over it. And I hope this is going, but not that one.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   The one that's the original one, the green one here. Yes.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.880]   Yeah. But that's the cool picture price model. Yeah. So they came out, they never, they did make
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.840]   this, but they never made the two-screen version. Yeah. And the coolest thing about it was that
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.640]   if it goes flat, it turns into a tablet. If it goes, if it's, you hold it up and bend it,
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.920]   it's in book mode. If you have like, if you put it upside down like a tent, it becomes like an
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.080]   alarm clock. If you, you know, it's like every, no matter which way you orient it,
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.840]   it would turn into a different device. And I thought that was such a brilliant idea for
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.520]   everybody, not just, not just to kids in the developing world. And I'm hoping that the
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.960]   Microsoft two-screen devices do this kind of thing automatically in a robust way,
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.360]   because that would be just amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Having that context awareness,
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:17.760]   you know, and having it know, you know, based on how you're using it, what orientation it's in,
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.120]   how it's open or closed, you know, and have it automatically change and adapt.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.800]   While still, you know, part of that, of course, you got to keep enough consistency, you know, that
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:35.600]   it's not, you're not completely changing the mode, but you know, to, to be able to work optimally,
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.080]   no matter how you're using it would be really cool. I just, I think it's really interesting.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.480]   They were seeing all these new form factors and the industry is far from Mora-Bund.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:50.400]   And what's also interesting is that the hinge seems to be for Apple with this new magic keyboard
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:57.200]   for Microsoft, their big hinges and from Samsung, all about the hinge. The hinge seems to be the new
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:04.160]   hotspot for design and technology. Yes. Who to thunk it. I was big, seriously searching a line to
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.920]   make sure that they've already made this public, but the on the Neo device, the keyboard, which
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.920]   is a magnetic keyboard, is actually really cool. It, you can actually push it up and the glass
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:19.040]   becomes a touchpad. And then if you pull it back down, it becomes like a, you know, the, like on
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.280]   the max, they have that kind of, that's a LCD at the top where it's a touch bar or whatever they
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.720]   call it. It becomes kind of a touch surface there. And so you get this kind of, you know, hybrid
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.320]   type feeling to it. It just feels really good. And so I think that's one of the things they're
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.560]   looking for is again, a new form factor, I guess you could say. Yeah, I think that's really exciting.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:44.080]   It's a special COVID twit. We're not talking about COVID, which is good. I thought by now we
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.720]   would be nonstop, but we've actually got some tech news to talk about. Mike Elgin is here,
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:56.080]   the digital nomad who has finally settled in Santa Clara County. We're glad to have you back.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.040]   And it's sad because you're in the area, but we can't have you in studio because we're
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.200]   everybody's remote now so close. So far away, Leo. Yeah, Lou Moresca, great to have you. He's
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.280]   the wonderful talented host of this week in enterprise tech, Twiatt. We really appreciate what
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:19.200]   you do with Twiatt. That's been becoming a great part of our lineup. And my car guy,
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.560]   Samable Samad, I bet you I'm not going to see that Mustang Mach-E this fall. Am I?
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:31.520]   I don't know. Hopefully it depends a lot on how long this goes on. You know, I know that, you know,
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.480]   engineers are still working on it. For it is shut down. The assembly lines, though. The
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:41.920]   factories are shut down right now. But you know, hopefully by August, September, you know, they'll
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.600]   be up and running again. I mean, we better hope stuff is starting to get up and running again.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.000]   Otherwise, you know, if things are still shut down and in that time frame, things are going to get
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.840]   really ugly. Everybody does now just in time manufacture, right? So pretty much. Because it's
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:05.200]   not just the, you know, when when Henry Ford built the Rouge River plant in Dearborn, the whole idea
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:12.720]   was box cars with with iron and timber and rubber would come into one end of the factory and a
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.760]   Model T would come out the other end. It was fully integrated and that for its time, that was the
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:23.200]   amazing innovation. But nowadays, of course, every car is made from parts manufactured all
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.040]   over the world by thousands of different suppliers. Those guys are shut down too.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:33.840]   Yes. So if there's no assembly plants consuming your product, you know, you got to shut down the
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:39.280]   supply plants too. So you got to get them spun up. How long does it take before once they're spun
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.360]   up, they can start getting the parts to the assembly line and cars can come out?
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.280]   It's usually not more than a few days. That's that just the time thing. They don't want,
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.400]   they don't keep inventory of parts. It's kind of on demand as it goes.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:59.200]   Yeah. And that has multiple advantages. You know, obviously it reduces cost a lot by not having to
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.480]   stock all this inventory. But it's also good for quality too, because when, if a production
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:11.760]   problem somewhere along the chain comes up, if you're stocking two, three weeks worth of parts in
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:18.640]   your assembly plant and a problem cropped up in the supplier plant, you're going to have a lot of
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.520]   bad parts in your factory. And it's going to take a while before you realize the problem.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:29.040]   And so if you're only stocking a few hours worth of parts or a couple of days worth of parts,
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.920]   then you can find those problems and address them much more quickly before, hopefully before they
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:41.600]   get out into the field. Yeah. Is there any truth to the rumor they'll be making ventilators at the
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:49.920]   Ford factory? Well, maybe not probably not in the assembly plants, but GM has been working the last
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:56.160]   couple of days with one of one of the big suppliers, one of the big supply or several of their suppliers.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.240]   And what they're, you know, rather than trying to convert their assembly lines, you know,
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.000]   because that's a very different product. Yeah, I mean, it would not be practical. But what they're
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.600]   doing is they're working with their supply chain. You know, there's a lot of companies making
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.640]   various kinds of plastic parts, metal parts, you know, a lot of the smaller components that
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:21.760]   they're tools, you know, they're using various kinds of flexible tooling that could be more
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.880]   rapidly converted to producing components for ventilators. And it was just an announcement
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:33.360]   that came out this afternoon. I dropped it in the chat earlier. But there, oh, here, there's
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:40.880]   an article in Cranes Detroit Business this afternoon that they are preparing with some of their suppliers
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.560]   to manufacture parts for at least 200,000 ventilators. Wow, that would be great. So they're trying to
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.320]   facilitate the supply chain to get the components that the, you know, some of the ventilator
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.280]   manufacturers are going to need to start cranking out more of these things.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.960]   Wow. Yeah. I'm probably in the minority, but I'd love a Tesla cyber mask.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:07.360]   That looks like the cyber truck with all angles. Yeah, I don't know what Elon's going to build in
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.280]   the you can throw steel balls at my face and then they just bounce right off. The sheriff finally
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.400]   got Elon to shut down the Tesla plan. He was tomorrow. Oh, there's, it's been running
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:22.240]   into. Yeah, interesting. Yeah. So it's all of this stuff. You know,
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.080]   the only thing I could, it reminds me of is when the lights go out at a football stadium,
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.640]   we were at the Super Bowl in New Orleans when the lights went out. And what they always say is,
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.520]   they can go out very quickly, but it takes them a long time to turn it back on. They don't come
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.920]   all on at once. They take a while to ramp up, but it sounds like car manufacturing, modern
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.120]   manufacturing processes aren't quite like that, that they can get back up and running pretty quickly.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:52.400]   Yeah. Well, as long as they shut down in an orderly fashion, and that's part of what some of
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.760]   the delay was, you know, in shutting down this past week, you know, is they wanted to, you know,
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.600]   get all their suppliers in line, you know, let, you know, get everything scheduled and set it up
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:09.280]   so that when the time was right, they could ramp back up again fairly quickly and without too
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.920]   much problem. We'll take a little break. We got lots more to talk about. Sam Ebblesimette,
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.760]   our car guy, Mike Elgin, our digital nomad, Elgin.com. You're still, you're still able to write, right?
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.640]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Now you're in California now, AB five, is that going to,
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:31.600]   they, the California legislature passed at the worst possible time, a rule that puts freelancers
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.480]   in California at risk because you can't write too much. So you're still going to be able to work
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.920]   even though you're not in Mexico anymore. Yeah, AB five doesn't affect me at all because I work
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.280]   for my own company and the relationship that the publishers have is with the company, not me. So,
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.000]   yeah, that's my, my, my boss is a jerk, but I work for myself.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.920]   And Lou Maresca, who works for an amazing team at Microsoft, including such an adult,
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:06.080]   I was just reading about him. I had no ideas. Adult Sun is a quadriplegic blind, cerebral
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:11.040]   palsy. I had no idea about that. He never talked about it, but I think that's a really, was a
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.680]   interesting story. And it's one of the reasons, of course, Microsoft has been so
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:21.440]   aggressive and active in protecting its employees, which is a great thing.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:26.720]   Our show today, Speaking of Microsoft, brought to you by LinkedIn marketing solutions. It's a
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.360]   hard thing. I'm a small business owner. I know how hard it is to get the word out about what you're
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:38.640]   doing. That's why we use LinkedIn marketing solutions. It's the best way to reach exactly
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:44.000]   the right people. We're all inundated all the time with millions of messages a minute.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.120]   And so it's hard to get people's attention, but LinkedIn can help you speak to the right
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:54.880]   professionals at the right time. You know that because LinkedIn is the last decent social network
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:02.320]   in the world, but it is. And it's one of the best with 62 million high level decision makers on
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.880]   LinkedIn. You're able to connect with exactly the right business leaders who are relevant to your
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:12.880]   company, the people you want to hear your marketing message. With LinkedIn ads, your messages are
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:17.840]   getting through to the relevant people. And they help you in a lot of ways. They have great targeting
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.960]   tools. We've used these that really help you focus on reaching the audience you want,
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.480]   right down to the job title, the company name, the location and more. And people are on LinkedIn
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.920]   because they want to learn. Of course, LinkedIn has great educational solutions. So a lot of people
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:39.840]   are there to grow to get a better job to make the connections and the networking they need to
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:47.760]   succeed in life. In fact, in a recent survey, 71% of people said the information that they find on
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.080]   LinkedIn, they use it to inform their business decisions. So they're there actively looking
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.400]   for information, information you can provide them by marketing on LinkedIn. You're going to tap into
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:05.680]   the hunger to know more. It has been so good for us. Very economical, very affordable, targeted
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.640]   to the right audience at the right time. As a podcast network, we've used LinkedIn marketing
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:16.080]   solutions for Twitter many, many times. It reaches a great, wide professional audience.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.960]   It expands our presence. It gets us in front of the people that we really want to get in front of.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:28.720]   And it's easy. This is also was a real revelation to us. Once you get on the platform, it's very
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:34.800]   easy to maneuver. It's very nimble. You can change the direction of your campaign very easily.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.080]   A really powerful way to market. People might say, you know, now's not the time to market. I
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:47.760]   disagree. This is a golden time to get people's attention and to have them start them thinking
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.400]   about your product, your service, what you're up to. This is the opportunity you've been waiting
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:58.240]   for. And right now, we've got a great deal, free $100 LinkedIn ad credit to launch your first campaign.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:03.920]   So all you have to do is go to LinkedIn.com/Twit, of course, terms and conditions apply.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:14.320]   LinkedIn.com/Twit. We really appreciate LinkedIn's support and this tough time. We're big fans.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:21.600]   And we thank them. And we thank you for supporting us by going to LinkedIn.com/Twit.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:27.200]   The just complete coincidence that Lou was on at this moment.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:33.120]   You're pretty. I mean, I think Microsoft is so big. It's pretty separated out, right? Every
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.360]   divisional is so forth. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, LinkedIn, in fact, especially the data,
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.320]   I mean, we're not even allowed to touch it. Oh, this is important, by the way, because
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.200]   you know, Salesforce, Mark Benioff, a little miffed. He lost out on buying LinkedIn. And he said,
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:52.240]   Microsoft's just going to use that data. So there's a big onus not to do that.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:57.520]   We're not supposed to. Yeah. I'm loud. I got my job at Navigant through LinkedIn.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.920]   You see, they found my profile and reached out to me, recruited me that way.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.280]   Yeah. I wish I could just film my position from LinkedIn.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.880]   I'm hoping position of my team. I can't film it. I have to say, really? Yeah. You should try Zipper
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:18.000]   Cruder. Oh, it's funny. Is that that? I'm going to do that. Yeah, good. That's another story in
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.200]   another day. Another sponsor, I should say. So this shocked me a little bit. So Google initially
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.000]   said, we're not going to do Google I/O. We're going to do a virtual I/O. Now they've canceled
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.360]   the virtual I/O. No developer conference at all for Google. Google seems to be taking this
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.880]   harder than some other companies. We were just talking about how, oh, we can't update Chrome.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.760]   We can't update Chrome OS. Now we can't do a virtual I/O. Yeah.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:53.120]   Thoughts? This seems weird because I think a lot of companies are starting to switch to online.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:16:00.160]   Right. And to have them just go entirely, shut it down. It seems weird. I just had a very successful
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:06.400]   summit last week. Yeah. And the heat summit, which we had thousands of people do different
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:11.600]   buckets and different information, different tracks of information, developer tools,
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.520]   office, that kind of thing. And this is what really great. It was a really great thing,
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.840]   even though it was at last minute. And of course, Build is going to be online here in May.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.200]   And I just think it's weird. They decided to shut it down. It doesn't make any sense to me
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:29.360]   that they're going to do that. They say it's out of concern for the health and safety of our
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:33.600]   developers, employees, and local communities in line with a shelter in place requirements
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.080]   by local Bay Area governments. We will not be holding an I/O event in any capacity.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.920]   It seems to me that it's likely that they don't want to have an unsuccessful event. I know that,
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.160]   you know, my son, Kevin's in education. He went to the, he signed up at the Q conference. They turned
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.240]   that into a virtual event. He said that something like 200 people showed up. So,
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:58.000]   Stern may be that it's just a dud of a conference and that's bad press and all the rest. So,
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.360]   that may be what's behind it.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.000]   The teachers, they can abstract that. They don't have to tell how many people are actually there
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.960]   or 10, either, because it's all online. In person, you can tell, but in online, you can't.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.960]   So, they could actually hide that.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.680]   Well, with shelter in place, even if you're doing it online, you still are going to have to get
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.440]   a bunch of people together in a studio or somewhere. I mean, for the same reasons, Leo,
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:30.080]   that you have most of your team working from home. They're probably trying to avoid getting any
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:36.080]   more people than necessary in one spot, in a studio or somewhere to do these.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.120]   It's tooable. I mean, we're streaming. We've got a, you guys are on Skype. I'm a loan to my
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:46.400]   officers and engineer. Two doors over. We'll never come within 20 feet of each other.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.200]   I have to watch handles and stuff as I go in and out. In fact,
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:57.120]   probably in an excess of caution, I'm also wearing a mask. I was wearing a camo deer hunting hat for
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:02.240]   a while, but I didn't seem to make me any safer. But I am wearing a mask as I go in and out,
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.200]   just in case, here's my only fear. Somebody comes out of door, bumps into me, and,
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.680]   so I'm turning, basically, I've turned into Larry David. This is a
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.040]   kerbier enthusiasm episode. Nonstop here.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:23.120]   While Google has gotten the most attention for canceling IO, Nvidia, like I said, I was supposed
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:28.400]   to be out there in your area this week. Nvidia was going to have their Silicon Valley,
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.840]   GTC, their GPU technology conference this week. They're big on self-driving technologies.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.800]   Yeah, and a lot of other things. But they were going to do all online sessions,
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.520]   and they've significantly scaled back a lot of what they're doing.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:47.280]   It's interesting. There's going to be a relatively small number of sessions.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.960]   I think they're going to continue doing sessions over the course of several weeks.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:57.360]   Their original plan was they were going to try and do all of the sessions online this week.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:04.000]   I think that maybe the logistics of that just proved to be too cumbersome to try to pull off
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.200]   right now. Microsoft just was at GDC, which was all virtual. I was watching a lot of the streaming
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:15.440]   coverage from Microsoft. It's not the same as meeting in person.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:24.000]   What is a developer conference? It's about giving developers the information they need to work on
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.960]   the upcoming platforms. It's not something putting it off. That's the kind of thing that
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.520]   has ripple effects down the road. I'm just surprised. I don't blame them for it. If they felt like
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:38.880]   they couldn't do it safely, then I applaud them for it. I'm a little bit
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:45.760]   surprised. There's definitely tools to have you interact with your attendees. You can still have
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.800]   a very good social interaction with them. Again, like you guys are saying, there's got to be some
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:57.440]   other purpose that they're having to do this for. Just don't use Zoom. Actually,
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:05.440]   there are ways to avoid Zoom bombing. I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing with you.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:14.800]   Cara Swisher and Jessica Lesson tried to do a conference. The problem is the default on Zoom
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:25.680]   is screen sharing is open to all attendees by default. Some evil person, stupid person,
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:31.680]   decided to share some porn. Actually, it was worse than that. I don't want to go into too much of the
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:41.280]   details of it. Who else did this happen to? A couple of other people. Chipotle was doing a
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:48.000]   public Zoom chat with musician Lauv. Is that how you say his name? Lauv. They had to shut it down
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.360]   suddenly. Not exactly the look Chipotle was looking for. Oh, yeah. Casey Newton from The Verge
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:02.240]   and Hunter Walk of VC were doing a work from Home Happy Hour. They got Zoom bombed.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:08.880]   The deal on this is, and there's a good article in TechCrunch,
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:15.280]   before you set up your Zoom, you might want to look at the settings and fix that because you can
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:21.280]   turn that off. There's a default. There's a setting that only lasts the hosts to share their screen.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.400]   There actually was a very good article in TechCrunch saying, "Also, you might want to turn off that
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:31.200]   thing that allows anybody to join before the host gets there. Not so good. You might want to turn
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.840]   on a feature that when you kick somebody out, they can't jump right back in. Not so good."
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:44.640]   There's ways to make Zoom more user-friendly, I guess, or more secure. Zoom really should set
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:51.120]   these up. Change the defaults. Change the defaults. Yeah. But Zoom, that's the whole thing. Zoom was
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:57.520]   always intended for... We use it for conference calls. It was always intended for a safe,
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.920]   corporate environment. Nobody anticipated that they do public events with hundreds of people.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:07.680]   They had to cancel their Jessica Lesson and Cara Swisher had to cancel their Zoom event.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.640]   It was, ironically, on the challenges women Tech founders face. They decided they're going to
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:22.000]   do it again. But this time, audio only. Wow. 600,000 people on Sunday last week downloaded Zoom.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:28.240]   It's biggest day ever. Of course, Zoom stock price, where everybody else is going down,
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:34.720]   there's been going up. All of the messaging and video-conferencing software, Cisco's,
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.560]   Microsoft, it's all just skyrocketing. Yeah.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:45.600]   Needless to say. My company uses Skype for Business internally. We normally use that for
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:51.360]   client presentations and calls. But I actually had to start using Zoom with one of my clients in
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:58.800]   China back late last year because you can't use Skype over there. Yeah. It's blocked. Yeah.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.640]   Funny that a lot of people are talking about WebEx. To me, it's better than Zoom.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:09.200]   It's expensive. But Cisco just announced WebEx will be free for the duration.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:16.080]   Yeah. Well, and take a look at WebEx. WebEx is fine if you're doing a presentation and you
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   just want to show the slides. But I don't think it has video features for video conferences,
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.960]   which is depending on what you're doing. It's great for some applications, but I think for
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:34.000]   others, it's not so great. There's Microsoft Teams. All those Teams also vary
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.240]   successfully. A lot of people downloading it because Microsoft's offering it for free for the
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:43.920]   duration, including all the enterprise features. A little problem though in Europe, right? It was
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.760]   down for a while. Yeah. You don't have to say anything about this, Lou, if you prefer not to.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.880]   No. Honestly, I heard about it being down. Yeah.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:56.000]   And I just don't. I have no- It was a year. That would happen. Yeah.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.560]   I think- We talked about it when this weekly. I don't remember. It was unrelated to traffic. It
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.440]   wasn't about a sudden influx of traffic. It was a bad timing. It was just bad timing.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.960]   Yeah. Well, I think it's- But there has been traffic issues and it's been really interesting
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:20.880]   that Netflix and YouTube and Amazon have all reduced video quality and also Facebook and
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.560]   Instagram have reduced video quality in Europe because they're concerned that everybody's using
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:32.320]   consumer networks and that it's going to be overloaded and people won't be able to do work and
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:38.000]   function. So that's actually a really kind of a weird thing. Suddenly there is no high quality
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.120]   video to be had in Europe. But at the same time, the ISPs here are lifting their data caps,
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:48.960]   you know, showing what nonsense that whole thing is on all of them. Yeah. That was my takeaway on
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.560]   that too. Oh, you don't need the data caps anymore. Huh? Oh, that's interesting. Well,
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.160]   I don't want to knock them because thank you. It's generous. Yeah. But I wonder how hard it's
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.160]   going to be for them to turn those back on now that we know it's not because of lack of capacity.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.400]   They- I won't stop them. Netflix did not do- I'll stop Comcast.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:13.600]   No, of course. Nothing will stop Comcast. Netflix in the US did not do the same thing.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:20.400]   And somebody said it was because of the infrastructure Netflix has set up. I don't know if this is
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.640]   true, but it makes sense to me. Do you remember they offered that? What was it called? The Open
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:32.240]   Network Alliance? Something that they offered ISPs where you would host a Netflix box in your
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:37.200]   network center so that your customers would actually be getting Netflix not over the public
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.960]   internet, but from within the network. And Apple does this. For instance, Apple has a Netflix
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.600]   server when you're watching Netflix on Apple. They're streaming it, I think through their
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.320]   Akamai network, through their CDN. We were talking about that when we were talking about net neutrality
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:26:00.000]   and how complicated that in fact is because you already have the super heavy users
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:07.120]   of Netflix and YouTube primarily hosting. So that's how we came to understand that the whole
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:15.680]   net neutrality thing is about between the ISP and the user at home. But yeah, that's a no doubt.
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.880]   That is a very different situation in Europe than it is in the United States.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:26.240]   I guess maybe they didn't do this. I think some other ISPs, I think Comcast hosts some Netflix
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.840]   boxes in their data centers as well. Yeah, they do. So that was the idea is Comcast's
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.760]   Cox spectrum. Your little guys would have a Netflix box, so it wouldn't clog up the public
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:42.000]   internet. And I would imagine if that was widespread in the US. I think for a while,
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.520]   I think Comcast said we're not going to do it. And I think maybe they've done it eventually.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:52.160]   But the idea was that would really ease internet bandwidth use. I think I saw 60%
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:59.520]   of internet traffic is made up of YouTube, Netflix, Amazon streaming video. A huge proportion.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:08.960]   Speaking of YouTube, Google is launching new resources to educate students at home
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:17.120]   over YouTube. I think that's a great thing. What was the term somebody who's disaster
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:25.440]   tuning? It's not a good word, but an opportunity in disaster. And I think a lot of companies are
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:32.640]   kind of taking advantage. They're coming, stepping forward and offering these resources.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:41.600]   Google's page is called Teach from Home. Google shows teachers how they can use Google products
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:48.160]   to teach remotely. It's hard for teachers who are used to sitting in front of 30 kids staring at
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.480]   them rapidly or not, to staring at a wall and trying to deliver the same content. As I said,
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:58.160]   my kids are very used to it. And I presume his teachers are, but I think a lot of teachers
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.200]   are struggling a little bit. Teach from Home also has a Teach from Home toolkit,
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:09.280]   which has resources about how to teach remotely in a series of slides. You can download that.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.920]   The Teach from Home site is only in English, but the toolkits are available in Danish, German,
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:19.360]   Spanish, French, Italian, and Polish more languages coming soon. YouTube has a research
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:27.600]   called Learn at Home, which is at learn@home.withyoutube.com. And that's all the YouTube educational
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.440]   channels. There are some really good... Mark has Brownlee when he was here last week.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.240]   I asked him, "Do you watch any YouTube?" And he watched all the great
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:40.720]   YouTube science channels, of which there are some amazing ones. He says he learned how to
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:48.320]   add a new video editing on MKBHD from YouTube. Wow. I think that's... There's a lot of great
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:54.480]   content on YouTube, especially for DIY stuff when you want to repair stuff. I repaired a
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:00.480]   television a few months ago. Based on videos I found on YouTube, we had a
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:07.120]   Vizio TV that just stopped working. Rather than throwing it out, we bought a new one to replace it,
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:11.840]   but I put the old one in the basement until I had a chance to take it and open it up and
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.560]   diagnose what was going on and had to do a little soldering. But got it working again.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:23.120]   I learned how to fix a garbage disposal. And for those of you outside... Putting your
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:30.240]   hand down in it? No, no. After I got back from the hospital, I finished... For those of you
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.160]   outside the United States of Garbage Disposal is what Americans... It's a blender that Americans
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.080]   have at the bottom of their sink. Wait, wait. They don't have those in the rest of the world?
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:43.200]   Oh, but he has them. It's actually a pretty awful idea if you think about it. Because you're
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:49.200]   just putting all your food waste into the water. It's a woodchipper at the bottom of the place
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.480]   where you put your hands. Yes, it's a terrible idea. It's like, "Hi, come to think of it with
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.680]   that perspective. It is really an awful idea." I never thought about your chicken bones.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:09.840]   So, when a European comes to visit your kitchen and you flip the switch and it goes,
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.840]   they go, "What the hell are you doing?" That's how you can tell Europeans who visited the
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:23.200]   United States. They have one hand. They do sensible things like compost. Google is also
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:27.280]   launching a $10 million... I had no idea, but of course it makes perfect sense. A $10 million
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:32.400]   distance learning fund as part of their $50 million contribution that's coming from the
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:39.840]   google.org philanthropic arm. This distance learning fund will help COVID-19 response efforts. In
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:47.520]   fact, the first million dollars goes to Khan Academy. Awesome. To help them do their remote learning
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:53.680]   stuff for kids affected by school closures. Very nice. I wanted to give them a little plug.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:31:06.320]   Anthony Leventowski. They're throwing the book at old Anthony Leventowski. He was the star engineer
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:16.080]   at Google in the Waymo Self-Driving Car Division, right Sam? Yeah, he was one of the leaders in the
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:22.720]   original self-driving car project along with Chris Ermsen and Brian Seleski and others. He left in
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:29.120]   late 2016 and took a whole bunch of technical documents with him. Started up his own company
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:37.680]   that he then six weeks later sold to Uber and then had a cascading series of legal battles after that.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:46.880]   Google eventually won a judgment of $179 million, which is basically the bonus that he had gotten.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:53.840]   Oh, is that where that number came from? Yeah, so all the leaders of the self-driving car project
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:32:02.560]   went back in 2010 or 2011, early on Google set up a bunch of milestones and said,
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:08.640]   the company's probably not going to be public by then, but they wanted to give them the equivalent
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:15.920]   of what the payout would be if this was a standard start-out that had an exit. So instead, if you
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:23.120]   hit all these milestones, these are the bonuses you're going to get. And Leventowski's, that $179 million
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:28.320]   was roughly what Leventowski got from Google as his payout for the success of that program.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:39.200]   Well, he can't give it back. He said, "I spent it all, man." He pleaded bankruptcy. I shouldn't laugh,
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:47.520]   but that is a pretty large fine. He also, on Thursday, pled guilty. He was charged with 33
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:54.480]   counts of trade secret theft in federal court. He pled guilty to a single count theft of a trade
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:33:00.800]   secret. It's a plea agreement, ends all the civil and criminal legal battles.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:09.040]   He agreed to that in exchange for dropping the other 32. 32. It is a criminal, please. So,
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:16.160]   I presume there'll be a sentencing hearing at some point. He faces a maximum penalty for
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:22.800]   10 years in prison. But based on the plea agreement, I would guess that there's some
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:32.000]   smaller amount of time that the prosecutors will ask for. He is currently CEO of Pronto.ai.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.080]   So, he went from Waymo to Uber, then went to the truck auto, the self-driving truck.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.720]   That was from Waymo, he started auto.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:46.960]   And then auto was acquired by Uber. And then after he got fired from Uber,
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:54.400]   he started up Pronto. That's a semi-automated driving features for trucks. So, he's back in
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:03.360]   trucks. Okay, the saga. What a saga. I wouldn't want to go to prison right now with the coronavirus
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.280]   flying around. I just saw this afternoon, the car-to-line steam.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.880]   Sometime, but not in isolation. Is it positive for COVID?
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:19.280]   No. Oh, man. Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow. I don't want to get the position of wishing
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.840]   anybody that because that's a nasty thing. There's a few people that I'm wishing would
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:29.520]   get positive. Wow. It'd be hard if you're in the general population to
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:39.440]   suppose they hand out Purell. No, I don't think so. Amazon's actually hiring 100,000 people
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:45.840]   in their, mostly in their fulfillment centers. Walmart said we could top that. They're hiring
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:52.960]   150,000 people. So, this is obviously good for some businesses. Although Amazon is
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:59.200]   going ahead and trying to find a grocery delivery service, they're closing their prime pantry due
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:05.520]   to high order volumes. I talked to a number of people who said that some of these grocery
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.680]   deliveries are two, three, four weeks out now. They've always stopped accepting
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:19.680]   content, products from vendors that aren't essential. They're suspending all non-essential
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:25.280]   shipments to warehouses. That somebody called me today wants a camera so you can stream
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:30.560]   courses and stuff. They're all like, you can't get them now. I said, yeah, I'm sure they
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:35.680]   have them in the warehouse, but they want to be shipping more important things right now.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:42.720]   What were you going to say, Michael? Just to clarify that the 100,000 is in the US only.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:48.800]   Wow. We don't know what they're hiring is abroad, but they're looking at hiring a lot more people,
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.720]   delivering a lot fewer products. I think they're going to try to have some sort of social
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:59.200]   distancing inside the warehouses and stuff like that. I think that it's important for people to
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:05.520]   be in there and see that the availability of products may be constricted in certain ways
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:14.240]   over time. Don't hoard and don't do all that stuff, but make sure that you do have certain
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.640]   things that you can order on Amazon now that you may not be able to order in a month or two.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.320]   You used to be able to set up Amazon Fresh for weeks ahead of time, but now they only do it
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.800]   like two, three days ahead here in Seattle, especially. Even then, those are all booked.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.800]   I have a bunch of people that I know that work there, and they're saying, "You know what?" Just
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:37.120]   like Mike is saying, they're not allowing any non-essential shipments into their warehouse,
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.920]   which means like you're saying, if somebody wanted to get a camera, they just couldn't,
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:44.640]   because they're not getting that supply into the warehouse to be able to ship it out.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.200]   Right.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.720]   That's where they're at right now.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:50.400]   What are you doing, Blue? You've got to feed a family of six.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:56.960]   So I actually use Instacart and Safeway around here actually delivers, and so we've
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.520]   been doing that. We've been able to get food.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.840]   Yes, we've been able to get food, so we've been doing that. We tried Costco a couple
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:07.120]   weeks ago, and that was like a disaster, so he's not staying away from that.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.080]   Yeah. We were able to place it, because we're, you know, a couple of weeks ago,
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.160]   Lisa went, she said, "I'm not going to let you go." She went shopping, thank you, Lisa. She's a
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.400]   little younger than me, and she went out and stocked up, but we were running low on some stuff,
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.040]   so we were able to order on Instacart. We'll see if it comes on Thursday, but I did check a
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:31.680]   bunch of other services. I tried to restart. You know, we used to have a CSA, a farm delivery,
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:37.040]   farm box, right? And we stopped it for the winter. I tried to restart it, and their site is just
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.680]   non-functional. I think they're being slammed right now.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:44.240]   My wife just signed up again for CSA, for the spring and summer.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:49.840]   I think that's a great thing anyway. Oh, yeah, we've done a lot of many years in the past.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.480]   Yeah, I stopped in the winter because I don't want too many root vegetables.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:58.480]   In Beaverton, Oregon, they've set up a drive-through farmers market, so it's like a regular
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.240]   farmers market that you stay in your car and you drive. I think that's a great idea.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:10.720]   So there is an op, I mean, I wonder, I think Blue Apron suddenly their stock is
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.960]   up significantly. I would think that Blue Apron, hello, fresh, all of these.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.480]   I don't know. Is this an opportunity for them?
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:24.720]   Well, I don't go through the normal shipment companies, right? And so these shipment companies
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.760]   are having trouble, and so, and then they're going to have trouble as well. So I don't know
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:36.560]   what's going to be going up. Right. So many people are working overtime, extra hard,
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.560]   risking their lives. Of course, the medical personnel, the first responders.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:45.440]   But let's not forget just even people doing deliveries and working in grocery stores.
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:50.880]   Those people stocking grocery stores are working their butt off. And thank you.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:57.760]   I got a notification this afternoon from next door that the University of Michigan
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:05.520]   hospital system is now looking for donations. If you've got masks, gowns, gloves, anything like
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:10.320]   that, they've set up a donation facility because they're running low on stuff.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:19.840]   Tech industry stepping up though, Facebook is donating 720,000 masks and 1.5 million gloves.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:26.880]   They have the N95 masks, surgical masks, a bunch of gloves. They say they bought the masks for
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:32.400]   office emergency kits following the wildfires. We actually had N95 masks in our house after the
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.200]   wildfires because the smoke was so strong in the area. So I don't think I went out and bought this
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:43.120]   N95 mask. We've had it for a while since the fires. Apparently, Facebook had a ton of them as
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.000]   well. So they're going to distribute those to hospitals. And they're not the only ones.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.680]   A lot of tech companies stepping up and saying here, take these.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:40:00.000]   So quick PSA, there's an organization called Project. So it's a website called project N95.com.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.160]   And they're serving as a clearing house for masks. So you can send your N95 masks to them and they
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:13.040]   will distribute them to hospitals. And they're trying to be an organizing service for getting
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.320]   the right kind of equipment to the right people then looking for N95 masks, surgical masks,
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:25.440]   isolation gowns and ventilators. That's awesome. Apple says they have 2 million masks, 2 million
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:31.280]   masks, which they're going to donate, not just in the US, but in Europe as well to
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.520]   healthcare systems. This is Tim Cook's tweet. Our team's at Apple been working to help source
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.560]   supplies for healthcare providers. Fighting COVID-19, we're donating millions of masks
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.960]   for health professionals in the US and Europe to everyone on those heroes on the front line.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.960]   We thank you. Do we know where they're getting them? Are these from manufacturing?
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:52.560]   Where are they getting masks? That's a good question. I'm looking.
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:00.000]   I don't know. I don't think that information is out there. They just seem to have possession
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.360]   of these masks. Well, I wonder maybe it is like Facebook.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.040]   So any factory or something? Yeah. For the factory or whatever. I don't know.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:12.720]   That's a good question. Yeah. Let's take a little break. We're going to talk about Pwned
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:21.760]   Own. They had to do it virtually this year. But first, let me take a little time out because
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:26.640]   we were working, even though we were working from home and we put together a little promo about
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.320]   some of the things you might have missed this week on Twitch.
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.640]   On Twitch. So we have no Carson Cam. This has me. This has me just
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.280]   saff. I vetoed it. That's where it would have been.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:45.040]   All about Android. Samsung actually is offering through their Samsung service centers and Galaxy
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.760]   Experience stores in 19 countries a service to disinfect your smartphone.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:55.280]   Mac Break Weekly. All right. What are those new those near earbuds you guys is wearing?
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:00.240]   They look like the old powerbeats. What's different? Basically, the powerbeats 4
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.480]   has the same sound quality as the powerbeats Pro, which is a significant upgrade in the sound
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.800]   quality over the previous powerbeats. Pange on tech. I've been spending the last week with
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:17.920]   the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. This is a beast of a phone. This weekend, enterprise tech.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.360]   A lot of people are working from home. A lot of people are working remote.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.240]   The security team might just not be ready. Darren Murph, who's had a remote at GitLab,
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:32.720]   called the trend crisis driven work from home. Employees are being thrust into remote work without
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:40.000]   preparation, without warnings, without documented processes to guide them. And not everyone who
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.160]   ends up working remotely is going to be able to adapt rapidly.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:52.320]   To it. Friends don't let friends miss to it. Thank you. Our show today brought to you by
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.800]   ExpressVPN talking about security, talking about working from home. ExpressVPN
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:03.600]   is the VPN provider I recommend and I use. I did a lot of research when they approached us about
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:09.680]   which the best VPN was. And time and time again, I came up with ExpressVPN. They're
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:16.000]   privacy policies, second to none. They engaged a third party audit. And the auditor said,
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.160]   and this just came out just a few months ago, ExpressVPN exactly adheres to their privacy policy.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:28.560]   They also developed a really cool technology, ExpressVPN, calls trusted server. When you use
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:36.480]   ExpressVPN, they don't log your data. They don't keep track of what you're doing. And they couldn't
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:43.040]   even if they wanted to. They couldn't even if they wanted to. ExpressVPN runs these trusted
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.920]   servers. So when you, you know, you have the ExpressVPN on your app, on your phone, on your laptop,
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:53.520]   it's one button, one click app, it's everywhere. I use it on Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:59.440]   When you press that button, you actually spin up the trusted server at the location you specify.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:03.600]   If you don't specify, I'll pick the one closest to you. That trusted server is all yours. It's
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:10.960]   running in a container completely separate from the operating system. It can't write to the drive,
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.760]   even if some bad guy got in and jiggered around with it or something, it can't write to the drive.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:21.280]   It can't log what you're doing. And the minute you shut down, when you turn it off,
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:27.520]   it spins down and no data has been saved. That means, unlike so many free and cheap VPNs,
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:32.560]   ExpressVPN has no information. They can't, you know, these inexpensive guys, they will sell your
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.800]   data to big companies. Sometimes they even inject ads into your VPN stream, not ExpressVPN.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:45.040]   And this has all been audited by a trusted third party. It really works. ExpressVPN is also fast.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:50.400]   For a long time, the reason I didn't want to use a VPN is I didn't want the overhead.
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:56.480]   You don't see it with ExpressVPN and I can count now numerous times I've turned on ExpressVPN.
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:01.520]   Let's say, in fact, the last time I did it, I wanted to watch some Netflix in Japan. They have a lot of
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.840]   a program that's not the same in Netflix in the US or logged into my Netflix, said, "Put me in
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:14.720]   Japan. So I'm in Japan, can watch at Netflix, Japan, freely, anything that's on there." And then I
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:19.920]   stopped watching, but I forgot to turn off ExpressVPN. I spent the rest of the day running on ExpressVPN.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:26.000]   I didn't even know it. The quality is so good, you can watch HD video perfectly from all over the
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:31.920]   world, thousands of miles away. I think that really sets ExpressVPN apart from all the other VPNs out
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:39.120]   there. It's more secure. They do zero logging. They are fast. It's not just me. TechRadar,
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:46.800]   the Verge CNET, all have rated ExpressVPN the best virtual private network. Protect your privacy,
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.920]   secure your traffic, even if you're sitting at a coffee shop or you're honestly nowadays,
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:57.200]   now that we're working from home, you should probably use it then too. Protect yourself with the VPN
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:03.760]   I trust and I use. Right now, if you go to ExpressVPN.com/twit, you'll get an extra three months free when
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:12.800]   you buy a one-year package that brings the price below $7 a month. ExpressVPN.com/twit. Now more than
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:19.120]   ever, we need to be secure. ExpressVPN is the way to do it. One button, one click, and I'm safe.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:28.640]   ExpressVPN.com/twit. Here's a product I think you guys should review, Leo. It's called the
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:38.320]   Lexon Oblio wireless charging station and sanitizer. It's a cup that you put your phone in and it
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:46.160]   wirelessly charges it and sterilizes it with blue light. Wow. Yeah. It's from the MoMA
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.800]   design store of all places. Oh, neat. So it's pretty too. Yeah.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:55.280]   Pretty. Mycosargent has this thing. It looks like it's more like a coffin for your phone
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.040]   and you put it in there. It's called phone soap and you close the thing and it's got a UV light
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.520]   and sanitizes it, right? And there's no moisture. Yeah, it turns out your phone is filthy.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:12.960]   Yes. And this one has no moving parts. It's just a little idea. Kind of like that. Or you could
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.280]   use your wipes. Two things you never want to shine a black light on your phone or in a hotel room.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.360]   Oh, you definitely don't want to know. Yeah. So you're now reminding me,
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.960]   Apple has given the thumbs up. You're allowed to use disinfecting wipes on your iPhone.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.680]   After years of telling people not to, turns out not. In fact, did you see, I loved it as we
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.960]   mentioned it last week, but Joanna Stern in the Wall Street Journal took an iPhone 8 brand new,
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:42.640]   put a piece of tape across it. And literally by hand, wiped it 1,095 times.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:49.680]   She had a collector. With toilet cleaner, right? No. Actually, well, she used a regular wipe first
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:56.720]   just to make sure that it did not damage the oleophobic coating that keeps fingerprints off,
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:02.160]   even after 1,095 times, which the number came because it's three times 365 is the three year
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.320]   term you would have that phone possibly. But then, yeah, she then used toilet cleaner and destroyed
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:18.080]   the phone. So don't do that. Don't use comment. No comment. Nothing. I've been using 10% peroxide
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.720]   water for a long time. And that's not very corrosive at all. And it goes everything. 30 seconds.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:28.400]   Yes. Hydrogen peroxide. Actually, I bought some Clorox hospital wipes and that's what's in them.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.600]   And it doesn't smell bad. Yeah. So that's good. That's a good tip from Loob.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:40.160]   And this is what he's doing to clean his four children every night before bed. You dunk them
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:47.360]   in 10% hydrogen peroxide. I don't give the bats. No, don't. The Lexon Oblio is on Amazon.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:52.400]   Let's see. If I can get it currently unavailable. You can also get it from
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:57.120]   directly from the MoMA Design Store. It's cool. It looks like a fancy face.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:04.720]   Yeah. I love this idea. Yeah, it's UV light. But it doesn't close. Does it like getting your eyes?
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:10.560]   I guess it's probably not great for when you're trying to sleep. It'll probably be like a blue
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.880]   Yeah, don't let's just give it another right. Don't look down at it. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.400]   So let's see. We were going to talk about what did I say we were going to talk about now. I forgot.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:28.320]   Something important. It was important. Actually, we're a couple of important things. We were
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:34.000]   talking about Facebook. So, Pwn to own. Pwn to own. Oh, yeah. So Pwn to own, which is normally held
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.720]   at the Vancouver Cancer West every year at this time. At a little problem because they
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:47.520]   hackers weren't going to fly to Vancouver to do this thing. So they did a virtual Pwn to own,
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:56.480]   which I don't know how well that works. They sent so the participants, the teams, instead of doing
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.800]   the exploit themselves, Pwn to own the whole idea is all year hackers have been saving.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:06.560]   How do I crack an iPhone? How do I crack Safari? How do I crack an Internet Explorer or Edge?
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.760]   They've been saving these exploits for a whole year and then they compete at CanSecWest
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:16.560]   to for points. And the more things you hack, the more points you get. If you get enough points,
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.920]   you often you'll win the thing you hacked, but then there's usually a fairly large cash prize.
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:31.280]   This year they couldn't do that. So, I guess this worked. They had the hackers email the exploits in.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:39.600]   Send us your exploits. And then I guess they rang a bell or something and the organizers
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:45.280]   ran the code. It was a live stream. All the participants were watching. Two days, six teams,
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:52.640]   they managed to hack pretty much everything. Windows, Mac OS, Ubuntu, the way they do this is
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:57.680]   you do a normal install, no special security, just the normal install, and then you have to hack it.
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:07.200]   Safari, Adobe Reader, Oracle VirtualBox, all fell. And you can actually, if you go online,
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:13.760]   ZDNet has the exploits, for instance. Exploit number one. The Georgia Tech Systems Software
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:20.880]   and Security Lab, team of Young Hui Jin and Jun Wan Lim, and Insu Yun targeted Apple Safari with a
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:27.520]   Mac OS kernel escalation of privilege. The exploit was successful. The Georgia Tech team used a six
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:33.520]   bug exploit chain to pop the calculator app on Mac OS and escalate its access rights to root.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.720]   The calculator app. Why did I think of that?
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:44.640]   70,000 dollars and seven. Should have been counting on that.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:51.200]   Seven Master of Own Points. But the winners after two days of this kind of excitement,
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:56.480]   they had won last year as well. In fact, I think I feel like they've won every year for a couple of
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:06.000]   years. Team Floral, Floral Acetate, longtime masters of Pwn to own security researchers,
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:12.560]   Emmett Kama and Richard Jew, nine points across the two day competition, fourth Pwn to own
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:19.840]   in a row for Team Floral Acetate. And they're all learning what everybody is now learning,
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:26.160]   which is that that meeting really could have been an email. Yes, it's a very good point.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.840]   I think it's hysterical. They emailed the exploits in.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:38.240]   Pwn to desktop local privilege escalation, Windows 10 local privilege escalation.
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:45.360]   That's the Floral Acetate team. They leveraged a use after free bug in Windows to escalate to
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:52.000]   system 40,000 dollars and four points. Oracle Virtual Box, a lot of us use because it's free.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.840]   Out of bounds, read bug for an info leak and an uninitialized variable for code execution
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:05.200]   on the Virtual Box hypervisor and boom, 40,000 dollars, Adobe reader, nothing safe.
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:10.160]   Now, by the way, part of the deal is as soon as this exploit happens, those exploits are
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:15.200]   immediately given to the company so that they can fix them. So I think that's the main point of
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:21.440]   Pwn to own. You ever want to do that, Lou? You know, I'm going to be honest. I'm not a good hacker.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:26.800]   I'm just not. There's a certain mindset that, uh, yeah, just because you're coded. I mean,
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.880]   you can. Yeah. I'm good at fixing.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.840]   Well, that's close.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:32.720]   Developing new self. I'm just not good at hacking other systems.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.960]   I think you must have to be very patient because you just keep trying stuff until something breaks.
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.840]   Well, you usually target something that's the least likely to be hacked and then they find
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:48.160]   the calculate. Emory exploits or something. Right. Exactly. And this is like, they find buffer
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:52.880]   overflows or something and they use that to exploit it. I'm usually the other way around.
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:57.520]   I, some that gets detected and then we just go fix it. So yeah, I'm just not a good hacker.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:05.440]   A couple of cases during this crisis of the US government loosening rules. HIPAA.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:10.640]   Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services says it will waive penalties for
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:15.680]   potential violations of the health insurance portability and accountability act. This is the
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:23.920]   Data Privacy Act that protects you from having your health data shared. HIPAA prevented medical
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:30.320]   providers from using tools like FaceTime because it didn't have the security tools in it.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:36.320]   There is, there is stuff, apparently there's Zoom for health care. That's HIPAA compliance.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.400]   So it's Skype for Business, but. Hard to run it to band. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:46.240]   There, you know, FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts and Skype. No, but HSS,
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:50.480]   HSS, they will know penalties. It's more important that you get the care out there.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:57.200]   And just to be clear, this is for messaging systems that are private. It's not about,
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:02.320]   it's not about interacting with your doctor on a public post or anything like that. It's just
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.640]   the private message. And as Dr. Mom's saying in our chatroom, it's for inadvertent, accidental
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:12.160]   release of information. Not, you can't just say, oh, it's okay here. Have, have my patience information,
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:19.920]   please. The one that worries me a little more though, the Department of Justice is asking Congress
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:30.560]   to waive habeas corpus. That seems like a blatant power crab to me. William Barr has really been
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:36.960]   kind of an authoritarian. He's also, of course, going to have, if the Graham Blumenthal,
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:42.880]   Earned Act passes, he'll also have the right to basically tell companies, no more encryption for you.
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:48.240]   The Earned Act is in committee right now, probably working its way through Congress.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:54.480]   Senate Bill 3398. And we've talked about it before, but you should go to the EFF
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:56:00.240]   Action Center if you care about this, read up on it, and then write your Congress critter.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:06.000]   I think both ideas are bad ideas. I don't see, I mean, there is a precedent for this
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.240]   Lincoln-wave habeas corpus during the Civil War. I don't think we're really
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:16.160]   in a civil war situation, but... And I don't think Trump is Lincoln.
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:23.120]   It's a law of nature that people in government will seize additional
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:28.160]   powers and rights for them, exactly. And so we have to push back. They push, we push back.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.880]   If we don't push back, they're just going to be able to use this crisis to erode
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:39.600]   our rights. And so really, everybody should care about this and go and get involved in this.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:44.640]   While you're sitting at home, call your members of Congress, your senator's office,
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:51.280]   tell them how you feel about this. I would hope Congress would be smart enough to say,
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:58.080]   absolutely not. They want the right to imprison indefinitely without trial, without charges.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.640]   It seems like there isn't... I can't think of any reason this particular...
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:06.560]   George Tkai had a great tweet about that yesterday. He said, "The last time that happened,
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.800]   his family spent four years in an attorney camp."
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:19.280]   Thank you, George Tkai. Israel has enabled emergency spy powers during this, an overnight
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:22.320]   sitting of the cabinet bypassing parliament approval.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.680]   The new powers will be used to enforce quarantine and warn those who may have come
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:31.600]   into contact with infected people. That's one thing that is happening. And I'm not sure I'm
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:37.360]   against it. It happened in China, Israel's using it now. I imagine it's just a matter of time before
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.360]   the United States government goes to Google and says, "We'd like to know location information
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:46.720]   for everybody in the United States so that we can warn people if they've been near a coronavirus
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:52.160]   patient." Oh, wait a minute. We don't have to worry about that here because there's no testing.
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:59.280]   No one knows. But they've used that in China and I think Israel has been using it as well.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:03.840]   But the problem with that is you have to know who's cut COVID.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:08.320]   I imagine though they'll work for that as well.
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:11.600]   Well, at least you'll know, in that case, you'll know social clustering at least.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.440]   Hey, there's people still clustering together.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:16.720]   Yeah, that's a good point. In Fort Lauderdale.
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:22.160]   Yeah. And South Padre Island. That's amazing.
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:29.600]   Great story in Tech Dirt. Mike Masnick's been really doing a great job talking about a lot of
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:37.440]   these issues. You may remember the shortage in Italy of ventilators. And it turns out that there
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:44.640]   is a particular part hospital in Russia last Thursday in the north of Italy needed a supply of
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:51.120]   special valves in order to use the ventilators to keep COVID-19 patients alive and intensive care.
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:54.640]   The manufacturer was out couldn't provide them.
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:59:01.840]   According to the newspaper in Italy with the help of the editor of a local newspaper,
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:09.840]   Johnale de Brescia and tech expert Massimo Temperelli, doctors launched a search for a 3D printer.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:18.720]   Word soon reached for Cassie, a pharmaceutical company boss in possession of the coveted 3D
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:23.200]   printer. He immediately brought his device to the hospital in just a few hours.
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:28.560]   Redesigned the missing valve produced it. They produced a hundred of them for free.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.800]   Of course, they won't wear as well as the originals, but at least they've got them.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:38.800]   And since they made a hundred, they probably have what they need to keep them running.
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:43.840]   Each 3D printed part costs roughly a dollar, which may explain
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:52.400]   why the company that makes this ventilator is so upset they charge $11,000 for those valves.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:55.040]   And they are now threatening to sue.
[01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:59.680]   I only have their evil, right? Yeah.
[01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:08.000]   You know, we're going to sue you because so they did not print the 3D files, which they
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:13.120]   published them, which they probably could. It should. If others are missing these valves,
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:22.960]   it could save lives. Audible is making stories free for youngsters at home. If you go to stories.audible.com
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:27.200]   for as long as schools are closed, we're open. Our sponsor Audible
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.200]   started today. Kids everywhere can instantly stream an incredible collection of stories,
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:35.920]   titles across six different languages to help them keep them dreaming, learning, and just being
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:39.920]   kids. And after being cooped up for days, I imagine your kids.
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:46.160]   Lou would. Oh my gosh. They love this. They love this. Well, you know what else is great is,
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:50.880]   you know, your local public library. Absolutely. Chances are, you know, they're online. Most
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:56.480]   public libraries have services like Hoopla, Libby, and Canopy is another one. And, you know, they're
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:01.520]   free. Even though the libraries are, most of the libraries are closed right now, you can stream a
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:08.560]   lot of movies, you can download music and audio books and ebooks. So, you know, if you have your
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:14.800]   local public library, go check it out online and take advantage of those services. That's exactly
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:20.800]   right. My sister is a librarian in Santa Barbara, California. And the everybody's working.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:25.440]   The library is closed, but everyone is working. They're answering the phones. They're doing
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:29.520]   everything they can. All the digital stuff, the streaming, as you said, is available. But
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:36.880]   even more crucially, maybe, if you have a question about anything, call the library. That's a good
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:44.000]   place to go to find out anything about anything, including the COVID-19 situation, what you should
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.280]   do in your community, all that stuff. They have all the answers, and they're all working. So,
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.520]   don't think that if the libraries are closed, there's no resource there, because the resource is still
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:57.520]   there. That's great to hear. And, you know, that's what librarians are trained for. They're not,
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.560]   you know, they're not just trained to shelf books. You know, they're actually trained to do research.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:07.520]   That's what library science is all about, you know, and to help people find answers to questions.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.880]   You may have read that the GameStop told its employees, "We're essential. Stay there and
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:18.560]   sell those games. GameStop's been hanging by a thread." Because, I mean, let's be honest,
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:24.560]   who buys games in a store anymore. I guess, you know, my kid does it. I thought, "Michael,
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:29.680]   you're going to end up, even if you buy that disc, stick it in and download 15 gigabytes before
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:35.920]   you can play. Anyway, why are you even bothering just by the online version?" He goes in because
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:41.600]   they come with little figurines. If you pre-order, you get little plastic crap, and he wants a little
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:48.480]   plastic crap. Good news, after getting a lot of heat about this policy, GameStop has announced
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:55.680]   they're going to close their California stores. Michael needs a 3D printer so he can
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:58.000]   print his own plastic crap. I know, print the plastic crap.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.200]   I think there's a lot of companies getting this slack, though. Amazon was doing this with
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.760]   their warehouse people. They said, "Hey, say you're 40-hour a week. You have to do 50-hour a week
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.440]   to cover this all." And so now they're kind of backpedaling on some of these.
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:14.880]   Well, they're paying double time, which is good. Right. Right. That's at least good.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:20.720]   "Our long national nightmare is over. The Sonic the Hedgehog movie will come out digitally March 31.
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.360]   Thank God. I thought we were going to miss Trolls World Tour. That's also coming out."
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:34.400]   What a relief. Actually, so universal, NBC Universal is releasing a lot of its movies
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:40.800]   to streaming. They're charging 20 bucks for a two-day rental, but you can at least you can watch
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:44.720]   it. So, Invisible Man. Have you watched that yet? I haven't seen that. I want to see it.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:49.440]   But I did watch The Hunt last night. Do you know the story of that movie?
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:56.480]   How was it supposed to come out last night? It was awesome. So, Betty Gilpin, who I love,
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:02.880]   she was in Nurse Jackie, she's in Glow, kind of never really got big star roles,
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:10.640]   always smaller supporting roles, was just amazing in this movie. But it was supposed to come out last
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:18.080]   September after more gun violence. They pulled it back. She was kind of bummed because I think she
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:24.080]   knew how good she was in this role. So, now NBC Universal saying, "Okay, well, we'll put it out
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:31.600]   $20 rental." And I was so desperate last night. We rented it. It's incredibly violent. The plot is
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:39.920]   a bunch of elitist liberal elite billionaires decide that they're going to have a hunt. They're
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:49.280]   going to gather 12 deplorables and release them and hunt for them. It's a story as old as time,
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:56.960]   isn't it? And it's pretty funny. The politics of it are hysterical. It doesn't have a political
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:03.440]   point of view. It's just very funny. But Betty Gilpin is brilliant in it. And it has, it's,
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:08.560]   so if you're looking for a very violent movie that you probably would never have seen in the theaters.
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:15.040]   Thank goodness they finally got that out. I've been watching Homeland, but it's kind of funny,
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:20.240]   like turning to Homeland because real life is too stressful and intense.
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:26.880]   The Tenses Show of all time. Actually, I've been watching old movies. You know,
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:32.640]   Fred is, I watched pal Joey, Frank Sinatra last night, great San Francisco movie. So, anyway,
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:38.960]   a lot of stuff streaming on YouTube. Contagion. I bet you nobody's watching that now though.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:45.760]   That was the number. So that movie came out in 2001, I think, old movie about 2011,
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:50.880]   2011, okay, 10 years ago, movie about this, what's happening to us right now, frankly,
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:55.920]   exactly. And it soared to number one on the iTunes charts a couple of weeks ago. I watched it.
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:06:00.080]   We all watched it. I don't think a lot of people are watching it right now. It's a little too close
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:04.160]   to home, do you think? Yeah, they were. Outbreak too is a similar outbreak. Yeah,
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:08.240]   there's a pandemic on Netflix is a documentary series about this.
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:13.520]   It's a little painful. If you haven't watched devs, you should watch that. Is that good?
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:18.720]   Yeah, it's really good. So there's a Nick Offerman. Besides Nick Offerman in it.
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:25.920]   It was shot at the UC Santa Cruz campus where I was a high school kid. We lived up on the campus
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:29.920]   when I came to California in the 70s. I can't wait to see it for that reason alone. What's
[02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:35.200]   it about? devs? Is it about developers? It's about this developer's
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:39.360]   late or something, right? Well, it's the Silicon Valley company.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:47.280]   And they've got this secret group that's developed an AI system that can essentially,
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:53.760]   it's around the idea that the entire universe is deterministic. And so they created an AI model.
[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:56.880]   So you would know what's going to happen back in time or forward.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:06.240]   And there's lots of intrigue and spies and everything. It's kind of a thriller.
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:11.520]   Sounds good. A little bit of sci-fi, a lot of thriller. It's really interesting.
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:15.680]   Okay, I'm going to watch devs. It starts tonight on Hulu.
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:24.240]   Actually, it's for four episodes in now. Oh, okay. So the first four episodes are up on Hulu.
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:27.200]   It started about three weeks ago. Oh, okay. Good. I want to watch it.
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:31.520]   Yeah, let's take one more break and then we'll wrap things up. What a great panel. It's so nice
[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:38.400]   to have you guys back in my old style cottage setup. We got Mike Elgin, just like the Skyposaurus.
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:42.640]   It is. It's Skyposaurus all over again. We got Samable Samad,
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:48.160]   Loomareska. Did you say this is your first time onto it? It is. It feels like old times.
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:53.600]   It's great to have you. I don't know why we haven't you had you on. I've been there a couple
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:56.560]   of times to put the episodes, but I've never been on. That's just nuts.
[02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:04.400]   Leo is such a jerk. Our show today brought to you by Capterra. Now's the time maybe to take
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:10.400]   advantage of the little timeout our businesses are having to improve your business software.
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:15.760]   So many companies put up with old business software, junkie business software.
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:19.840]   That's, you know, I always make a joke, but it's kind of true for us. It was written by,
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:25.040]   you know, an intern five years ago, the interns gone on and become a veterinarian. He doesn't do
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:30.240]   software anymore, but you're stuck with it because it's the only software you've got to run your
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:36.400]   business. Even though it requires you run an old copy of Windows XP, you don't have to suffer.

[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:39.840]   simplified. S-S-S-S. Thank you, Capterra. I did watch from GDC. In fact, we streamed it. It's on our
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:46.960]   Twit Live specials. It's on the news, I think, streamed. Twit.tv/news. The Xbox. Sorry. We
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:52.480]   watched the Xbox but didn't learn anything. Sorry, Lou. But before that, I was disappointed. It was
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:59.440]   like, guys, Sony just did this most amazing description of the details of the hardware.
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:04.880]   They had Mike Churney, who is an really interesting guy. When he was 18 years old, he dropped out of
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.480]   UC Berkeley to go to work for Atari. He wrote the Marble Madness arcade game.
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:16.400]   I mean, this guy, and then ever since he's been like this brilliant developer genius,
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:20.480]   he's not a Sony employee, but for the last two play stations, he's been a consultant.
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:28.560]   He's the chief architect of PlayStation 5. I thought it was very interesting to hear him talk.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:34.880]   For one thing, it was clear that they kind of didn't... They knew that in a spec race, they came
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:42.480]   out second to the Xbox Series X. Xbox Series X has 12 TerraFlops graphics processing.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:51.280]   They only have 10.5. The CPU is not being run as fast.
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:56.800]   In fact, for the first time on a console, Sony's going to use basically what's like speed step,
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:02.000]   with frequency variation depending on the need of the game. They also, instead of having a
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:09.040]   terabyte SSD, they have an 855 gigabyte SSD. But then they did something kind of interesting.
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:12.720]   Actually, I think I like Microsoft Solution a little bit better. Sony's going to leave an
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:18.720]   OpenM2 slot for you. So you can open up the case, put in it as long as it's certified, and only,
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.080]   not all of them will be, but put in an M2 to expand the storage. Microsoft's doing an even better
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:28.400]   same idea, but they're using... They're going to have a little cartridge that you plug in.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.400]   So it's a lot easier for the user. The Surface X does this, too. There's a little door that pops
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:36.800]   open and just slide it in there. It's pretty great in. I think it's a great idea. But I
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.640]   would just was fascinated. They talked a lot about audio on the PlayStation 5, what they're
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:47.760]   doing with audio, why they feel like 10 TerraFlops is sufficient, why they're using an SSD.
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:53.760]   The Xbox Series X will have an optical drive, a Blu-ray, but not the Sony, even though they invented
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:58.240]   Blu-ray. And that's, I think they had explained a little bit there. They said, "You know, just
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:03.200]   the SSD is so much faster loading. We just don't want to put a game on a Blu-ray disc."
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:08.480]   He dropped a little at the beginning. He dropped a little line that I picked up on. A lot of people
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:16.000]   did. The PS5 will support the overwhelming majority, not all, but the majority of PS4 games.
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:23.200]   And they talked a little bit about why that was. But we're getting close. I don't, you know,
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:27.680]   it'd be nice if they could push those out a little early, because there's a lot of people at home
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:35.840]   playing games on the PS4 and the Xbox One X. I have been. I know. It's a good way to put your mind at least.
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:39.600]   A lot of these services are having trouble, too. I think Xbox had a little trouble last week in
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:53.040]   PlayStation 2. Yeah. Touring Prize goes to Pixar pioneers for inventing CGI processes like the
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:58.480]   RenderMan, Pat Hannerhan, and Ed Catmull from Pixar, the share of the $1 million, the Nobel
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:05.120]   Prize of Computing. Touring award from the ACM. Congratulations. Yeah, Catmull did Z-Buffering.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:10.400]   I mean, that's basically used by everybody now. He invented Z-Buffering. That's wild.
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:16.880]   That's the idea of depth as well as X and Y-axis. You get the texture mask.
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:20.160]   Right. That was one of the things that was so interesting. Turnie was talking about
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:27.040]   kind of the same thing with audio. Z-Buffering audio, so 3D audio. And you still have to do,
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:32.720]   they're going to use ray tracing to calculate occlusions, not just for the visuals, but for the
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:39.200]   audio. So if somebody goes behind a rock, their voice will be attenuated by the rock. I thought
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:45.360]   that was just fascinating. So congratulations to Catmull and Hannerhan.
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:51.440]   Well deserved. Well deserved. Yeah. Anybody got any Bitcoin?
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:59.440]   No, but I have the password to your wallet. Oh, yeah, I would love that right about now. I'd
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:04.640]   appreciate it. Let's see. I think that's, I'm just seeing if there's anything,
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:10.160]   you guys looked at the rundown, anything? We missed robo-taxis, needed disinfectant system.
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:13.920]   I was surprised to see this. A lot of the autonomous vehicles are off the road.
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:19.680]   Probably because it's not safe just to have somebody else getting the car for the next ride.
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:24.960]   Yeah, well, you know, all of the, you know, the ones that are actually carrying passengers
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:32.400]   right now, which is mainly Waymo in Arizona and active in Las Vegas, they still have safety
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:38.320]   drivers in them. And, but even down the road, you know, at some point when we have some other
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:44.000]   pandemic at, you know, when we eventually do have actual true robo-taxis. Yeah. You know,
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:48.720]   you have this problem of, okay, this is something we need to be thinking about now.
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:54.320]   You know, today when you have taxi drivers, you know, or ride-hailing drivers, you know,
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:58.960]   if somebody gets sick in the back of your car, you know, you know, and you can pull over and
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:03.920]   clean it up and, you know, or if they leave something behind. But in the future, you know,
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:09.200]   where there's no driver, robots can't clean, Robert, there's, there's no way for them to clean
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:13.840]   them to get those vehicles cleaned. And if you've got somebody that's sick and, you know, coughing
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:21.600]   in the vehicle, you're going to need to put something like these UV emitters, you know, in the,
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:25.520]   in the cabins of these vehicles. So, you know, because you can't have them going back to the depot
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:31.520]   after every ride to get cleaned up. So, you know, they, the companies building these things
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:36.080]   need to start thinking about this now, you know, about how are they going to handle this going forward?
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:45.280]   They should do, have you ever used those French public toilets in San Francisco? They should do
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.720]   that. Have you used those money? Well, they claim themselves over, no, they do. They have them
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:56.480]   up a quite tower. Yeah. So, it has a mechanical door. So, you go in, you do your business. The
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:03.760]   door closes and locks behind you. And then it, it, it hoses itself out. It's completely clean the
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:10.160]   next time you use it. Yeah. There's going to have a lot of application and that's one of them that
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:16.000]   we need. Absolutely. And, and, you know, this is the, you know, just a quick, a side of something
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.920]   I witnessed in Mexico City, which I thought was really interesting. When, you know, a couple years
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:25.760]   ago, the electric scooters, electric bicycles, all that kind of stuff was exploding in Mexico City.
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:31.360]   I mean, just everywhere. They're multiple. I love them. I love them. Yeah. But now, nowadays,
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:37.040]   there's almost nobody's using them because Mexico City's streets and sidewalks aren't quite,
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:41.280]   people are, we're biting it and wiping out on the street because of the aircraft in the street
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:47.040]   or something like that. So, you need really good roads for all this ride. So, this is,
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:52.800]   this is another example of where we need self-driving cars that cose themselves down. And we need,
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:18:00.000]   we need scooters and bicycles that can handle rough terrain for cities that are not, you know,
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.920]   Phoenix, Arizona or something like that with great roads. So, you know, there's going to be,
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:09.760]   have to be a lot of adaptation and a lot of the adaptation for, you know, along the lines of the
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:16.560]   sharing economy, et cetera, the, the, the gig economy. You've got all these people who are being laid off
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:22.640]   and they, you know, laid off people can turn to a gig economy job right away like driving.
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:27.840]   But with those in decline, that's a problem. So, everybody's going to have to get creative about
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:35.120]   how they can deliver things virus-free, how they can offer rides in a way that's safe for everybody.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:41.280]   We need a lot of innovation fast in all of these areas for the coronavirus and also to just deal
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:46.320]   with reality going forward. Well, there's an incentive now. I want to, I want to correct myself.
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.400]   I guess Sony is putting an optical drive in. I was just looking at the specs. I misunderstood
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:55.520]   Mark's presentation. I thought he was pointing out that they're going to use an SSD. I thought it
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:00.480]   meant he meant in lieu of an optical disk, but I guess it's in addition to, or maybe the optical
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:06.000]   dish will be optional. Neither Microsoft nor Sony announced a price. Now, the games will come on
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:15.120]   memory stick now. I hope not. I do hope back the old Nintendo model. You know, a lot of TV shows
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:23.360]   and movies. They're all shut down. No more production. Netflix is creating a $100 million fund
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:30.400]   to support all the Hollywood people put out of work. Not the million-dollar movie stars. There's a
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:38.160]   lot more people work on a movie, the gaffers and the rigors and all of the catering crews.
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:43.600]   So, Netflix is shutting down a lot of its productions, but they have pledged $85 million to support
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:49.360]   people working on its productions and another $15 million to third parties like the motion
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:54.640]   picture and television fund. You might want to ration your Netflix watching, you know, so you
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:57.840]   don't run out of stuff to watch. You're going to run out, but it takes a while, right? They've
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:01.920]   shut down the Witcher. They've shut down the new season of The Witcher, the new season of Stranger
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:07.520]   Things. They're going to not continue to pay everybody, but they're going to give people some pay
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:13.520]   to at least two weeks pay even on those shutdowns. Yeah, Apple shut down their production.
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:16.960]   Well, if we all get desperate. Yeah, if we get desperate for entertainment,
[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:22.880]   we'll always have you two. We'll always have podcasts. Podcasts, my friends. Podcasts. That's right.
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:31.280]   Mike Elgin, thank you so much. I'm glad you're home safe and sound. Thank you, gastronomad.net.elgin.com.
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:40.160]   Don't forget to get chatterbox. That's your son, Kevin's really cool project to design
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:45.440]   your own voice assistant a great way while you're stuck at home with the kids. I think parents are
[02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:51.440]   looking for ways to, you know, create curricula for the kids. You want to see how smart this is?
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:51.680]   Yeah.
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:56.080]   What's the best tech podcast?
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:21:00.400]   Twit with real up. What is the best tech podcast?
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:08.560]   What is a smart device? I must have. I have a friend in high places. That's right.
[02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:15.360]   Where is it? We can get chatterbox. Hello chatterbox.com. And there's, by the way, if
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:21.200]   you got a kid who's got a school closure, use the offer code, keep learning. Oh, nice. And you
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:27.440]   get a discount. Oh, that's nice. 15% discount. Yeah, that's really great. Is Kevin doing well
[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:33.280]   with it? I think it's a great idea. He is. Manufacturing is difficult, but he's able to do it. So,
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:38.880]   yeah. So what's in there? Is it an Arduino? Is it a Pi? What is in there?
[02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:43.200]   It's a Raspberry Pi based thing and he's got his own proprietary sound board.
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:50.480]   And most of it is open source and so on. And it's cardboard on the outside, of course. So,
[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:55.280]   it's very inexpensive to replace the outer part and the inside is reusable. So, really.
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:22:00.400]   It's a great product. It's very private. Thank you, Mike. Stay well, stay healthy. We'll see you
[02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:04.240]   again soon. Thank you. Thank you, Leo. With any luck, because Mike always would bring me
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:09.200]   food stuffs when he comes up here. Last time he brought me a beautiful brown sugar
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:16.240]   panella from, was that from Mexico or El Salvador? It was that was from Mexico. Yes.
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:20.880]   But it's a traditional Central American form of sugar unprocessed sugar.
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:27.680]   And I didn't yet make a Mira's recipe for the butternut squash with panella,
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:34.400]   casserole. But you got to do that. Best in dessert I ever had. You bake it. It's, oh my god, it's
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:39.840]   amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Mike Elgin. Sam Ables, Sam, always a pleasure. Thank you,
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:47.600]   Mike. Our guy who is stuck with driving his Miata in Detroit. I'm sorry to say. No, that's not so bad.
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:54.960]   That's not so bad. We'll see. We'll see Sam every Sunday on the radio show, but also,
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:23:00.320]   of course, his wheel bearings podcast is available at wheel bearings dot media.
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:05.760]   And there's still a lot to talk about, I'm sure. Oh, absolutely. We just, we recorded one a
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:11.840]   couple of days ago. We got two hours in there, all socially distanced. My co-hosts Dan Roth is in
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:16.800]   Boston and Rebecca Lindlin is in Connecticut. So, you know, we stay well apart from each other.
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:23.920]   Very nice. Wonderful. And boy, Lou, now that you've done the big show, I think we're going to have
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:28.320]   to get you back here on a regular basis. I really appreciate it. Lou Maresca is the host of our
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:33.920]   enterprise show this weekend enterprise tech. He's also a, let me get, I think I put your title up.
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:38.960]   So I code monkey, code monkey principal engineering manager at Microsoft in the office products
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:43.120]   division. And we really appreciate you spending some time on this Sunday evening.
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:49.920]   Exactly. Yeah. Take care of your family. We really appreciate all you do for the
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:55.840]   Twit Network. We appreciate all of you who join us every week to talk about the week's tech news.
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:24:01.600]   We hope you're staying healthy. And we hope you will listen to more of our shows. They're all
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:06.400]   available at twit.tv. This show we do, as we do with all of our shows, we stream live as we're
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:12.400]   making it. You can watch us do the live stream at twit.tv/live every Sunday, right about 230
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:19.360]   Pacific. That's 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC. There's live audio and video at twit.tv/live of course,
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:23.360]   because it's a podcast, you can always get it on demand. The on demand show is available
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:30.160]   at twit.tv our website, but, and YouTube, but the best way to get it, subscribe in your favorite
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:35.120]   podcast application that way you'll have it ready for your Monday morning non commute.
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:40.720]   You're commute from the bathroom to the living room. That's the only thing I worry about is that
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:44.000]   without commutes, are people going to listen to shows as much as they did before?
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:49.120]   I listened to lots of podcasts. I do think so. I'm looking from home from here. We're here to keep
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:55.520]   the company. We did it something last Friday that I think we're going to do more of.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:03.600]   I got together with all of our staff hosts, Mike Asargent, Ant Pruitt, Jason Howlin. I,
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:08.000]   and we did it and asked me anything in AMA. Great. And it really enjoyed this.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:17.120]   Did you watch it? It was so much fun to do. We've put it, I think it's on our twit.tv/events feed,
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:22.480]   I would guess. So if you missed it, and I think we're going to start doing those more often. In fact,
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:26.000]   Lou, I think you're going to do one. Yeah, I would love to do that.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:35.200]   Yeah. So I think that'll be a lot of say again. It's on the main twit page. Okay. So go to twit.tv
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:40.720]   or twit.tv/youtube.com/twit. And you can see or ask me anything. That was a lot of fun.
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:47.360]   Otherwise, all of our shows continue. As always, the recordings are a little different as it was today.
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:52.880]   Apologies if I made anybody nauseous with my switching. I'm getting back. I haven't done this
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:58.880]   in nine years. Give me a break. I'm getting back in the saddle. Thank you everybody for watching.
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:03.600]   Stay healthy, stay safe, and we'll see you next time. Another twit is in the camera.
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:05.600]   Amazing.
