[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400]   We'll talk about Spotify and the Joe Rogan controversy.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.080]   Google killing off flock, replacing it with topics.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.880]   And now that Nvidia is not buying arm,
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720]   what is the chip landscape gonna look like going forward?
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.440]   Plus the biggest quarter in Apple history.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.640]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.400]   tech news.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.740]   I have assembled a cast of all studies.
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.660]   Wonderful people starting with Denise Howell, a long time
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.140]   host of our show this week in law at DeniseHowell.info,
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.440]   my favorite internet lawyer.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.640]   Hello, Denise.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   The Webb's Law department at your service.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.880]   Love you.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.240]   The Webb's Law department.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.040]   Do you answer the phone like that?
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.540]   I should.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.040]   Webb's Law department.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.540]   Yes.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.400]   I'm sure we'll find some legal questions for you.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.780]   Actually, there's a big question about Spotify
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.820]   when I ask all of our panel.
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.140]   Jason Heiner is also here.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.660]   Brand new job for Jason, editor and chief of ZDNet.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.180]   Big shot.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.060]   You go in places, Jason.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.660]   That's nice.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.140]   Congratulations.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.020]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.260]   Great to be here and thrilled to be back with the team at ZDNet.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.300]   My second tour of duty there and big things planned for 2022.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.500]   Do you get to write anymore?
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.100]   Or are you just-- it's all management now?
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.380]   I do.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.800]   And perhaps I'll have a little bit more time to write it.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.200]   For the last three years, I've been working at ZDNet
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.600]   and driving a lot of change, transformation,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   and didn't always have as much time to write
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   as I would like more editing and guiding coverage.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.000]   And so I might have a little bit more time to write.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.480]   We'll see.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.840]   Well, that's great to see you.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.840]   And it's always nice to see the nice guys win.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.520]   So that's great.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.080]   Congratulations.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.560]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.120]   Also, Harry McCrack and the technologizer from Fast Company
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.460]   is here.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.000]   Hello, Harry.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.680]   Hey, Leo.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.680]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.520]   Always good to see you.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.440]   Harry, writing about a whole bunch of stuff these days.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.400]   Not so much of the history, though, that you were doing before.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.960]   I hope you get to keep doing your internet history
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.880]   and travels down memory lane and all that stuff.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.920]   I actually-- my job's evolving a little bit too,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.760]   and I expect to be able to write more this year.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.920]   And I wrote some of that time to history stuff.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.420]   Good.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.720]   I love that.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.840]   There's nobody-- no better observer of this,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.560]   because you like me.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.040]   We've been there.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.960]   It's not history for us.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.360]   But it is for most everybody else.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.460]   So I think we probably should kick off
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.400]   with Spotify, Joe Rogan, and what's going on there.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.340]   So Spotify, under a little bit of heat last week,
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.960]   270 physicians, epidemiologists, scientists,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.200]   wrote an open letter saying, you've got to do something
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.280]   about Joe Rogan.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.640]   Joe, of course, hosts the Joe Rogan experience,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.320]   probably the most likely the most listened to podcast
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.760]   in the world.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.440]   He claims 11 million listeners a week.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.000]   I don't know if it's that many.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.080]   It's easy to claim big numbers like that.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.360]   That's a lot of people, a lot of young people, especially
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.680]   young men listen to Joe.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.180]   On the December 31, Rogan had a guest on who
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.620]   claimed to have invented the mRNA vaccine,
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.700]   the face of all evidence, to the contrary.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.380]   And furthermore said, it doesn't work.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.460]   And you're being hypnotized into using it.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.060]   That stimulated the letter from the physicians
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.180]   and the scientists.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.340]   Spotify declined to respond.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.580]   They didn't do anything about Joe Rogan.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.300]   They've taken others of his episodes down,
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.160]   but they said that did not meet their threshold
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.920]   for a takedown.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.840]   So the response from other artists
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.480]   has been strong.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.880]   Neil Young at first said, take my music down.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.600]   If you're not going to take Joe down,
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.560]   Joni Mitchell followed, Nils Loffgren others.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.160]   When Neil Young said, take my music down,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.440]   I think Spotify thought was, yeah, final man.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.000]   Go ahead.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.640]   Who cares?
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.240]   But the stock market did.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.920]   The company lost $4 billion in market value.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.660]   It's stock price tumbled 12%.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.900]   And we'll see what happens on Monday.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.500]   That might not hold for very long.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.900]   But the real question I have for all the three of you
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.500]   is, what-- let me start with you because you're
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.620]   an editor-in-chief at ZeeNet.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.340]   What is Spotify's responsibility?
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.380]   They hired Rogan.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.020]   They spent reportedly $100 million
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.500]   to get exclusive access to his podcast.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.700]   So they're his employer, I guess.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.900]   I mean, if we're just a show, if we're a show like ours,
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.280]   Spotify wouldn't have any more responsibility over it
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.880]   than anybody else would.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.360]   Although I have to say Spotify, Apple, and others
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.320]   have pulled down other podcasts.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.800]   I think Alex Jones famously is hard to find a platform for him.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.320]   What is Spotify's responsibility, Jason?
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.640]   Yeah, there's really two fundamental issues.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.760]   And we'll start with maybe the first one,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.600]   getting back to the base principles of this.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.680]   It's like, what's your responsibility as a platform
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.520]   to have a certain level of freedom of expression, right?
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:20.120]   So that you are-- are you the arbiter of taste,
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.860]   of what-- of truth?
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.040]   Because truth is somewhat malleable.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.600]   Or-- because when you do that, then you open yourself up
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.560]   to claims of bias.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.720]   So this goes back to the beginning of Twitter.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.560]   Twitter sort of originally stated,
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.000]   we're just the platform.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.320]   Whatever people put on here is up to them.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:49.400]   And the merits of it or the ability
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.160]   to publish things that not everybody likes is OK.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.520]   Because you have to put up with that in order
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.080]   to allow everyone to have a platform.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.520]   Well, we see how that worked out for them, right?
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.960]   Eventually, they came under a lot of pressure
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.760]   in a number of different ways because of things
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.080]   that were done on their platform that then
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:15.720]   became even dangerous or destructive in some way to society.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.520]   It's the same with Spotify.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.600]   So they are going to be under continuing pressure.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.640]   And I think there was a certain sense
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.240]   that if this was just Neil Young, who can be a bit
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.520]   iconoclastic, right?
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.960]   He is a person who likes to take stands.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.480]   And now--
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.360]   It's very vocal.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.440]   Exactly.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.000]   Very vocal.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.880]   If it was just Neil Simon, I think Spotify might have said,
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.200]   we're still going to stick to our guns on the platform angle.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.920]   But once it elevated from there to others and spread
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.200]   and the idea of this, well, now it's sort of a bigger problem
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.120]   where there's more societal backlash against this
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.200]   and there's a lot more pressure.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.480]   So that's the first piece, is that this platform issue.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.360]   The second is the fact that their strategy, their podcast
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.560]   strategy, has not really worked out as well as they thought.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.480]   Just let's--
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.520]   Well, that's clear, right?
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.280]   They used $100 million for Joe Rogan is a lot of money.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.240]   They bought--
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.040]   call her daddy for $60 million, reportedly.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.800]   They spent half a billion dollars on acquisitions
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.480]   of Gimlet Media and Anchor FM.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.360]   Yep.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.720]   They have a lot invested.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.880]   And from what--
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.680]   I can't remember exactly how much of this they
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.040]   have announced publicly.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.960]   But the understanding is in the industry
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.480]   that Joe Rogan is by far their most popular podcast.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.640]   I think he ranks number one on their list.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.360]   And so this is where it starts to get tricky from a business
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:58.880]   standpoint.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.160]   It's a business that's only struggling.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.640]   It's a money maker.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.160]   He's the only-- probably the biggest hit
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.760]   and maybe the only real hit that they've got.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.760]   And so now they have also a very difficult question that's
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.440]   going to hit them in the pocketbook where a strategy that's
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.560]   already struggling and that they're looking at maybe,
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.680]   do we have to reboot this or pivot it?
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.840]   And now their biggest money maker is under a lot of heat.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.320]   And so it's a twofold question for them.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.240]   And they're in a difficult spot.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   And we hope that they figure out a way to find a good path
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.560]   forward.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.360]   A broadcaster, Brene Brown, has said,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.520]   I don't want my shows on Spotify.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.320]   Megan Markle and Prince Harry, who
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.440]   were reportedly working on a show for Spotify
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.960]   and had paid a lot of money to do it,
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   now are expressing concerns.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.440]   I should mention-- I did not know this,
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.200]   but part of the story is that Neil Young himself had polio
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.800]   when he was five years old, contracted polio two years
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.000]   before there was a polio vaccine,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.600]   spent a lot of time in the hospital re-learning how to walk.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.400]   People forget what a scourge polio was in the '50s.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.320]   And when the Salk vaccine came out,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.880]   I don't think there were-- I'm sure there were some people
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.080]   who refused to get it, but I don't think there were many.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.160]   It was a terrifying disease.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.760]   And I think that was almost universal support
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.640]   of the vaccination at that time.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.720]   He is a vaccine supporter because that he also
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.320]   has epilepsy and type 1 diabetes.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.040]   So he's very aware of this.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.120]   Is there a First Amendment story?
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.640]   Denise, the internet's attorney.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.720]   Hi, quick answer.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.640]   No, there's no First Amendment story here.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.680]   This is not the government.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.640]   This is not the government.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.040]   This is a private, any making decisions.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.080]   And it has to confront a couple of factors here.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.880]   Sometimes people use--
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.440]   Sometimes people use words First Amendment
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.520]   as a way of saying free speech.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.960]   Two different things.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.600]   We do have free speech.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.320]   But he works for a company, and any company
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.000]   is the right to say their employees.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.360]   You can't say that.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.240]   That's right.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:17.560]   So it is a Spotify question of what sort of information
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.120]   or disinformation it's going to support on its platform.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.360]   We've been through this on other platforms.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.680]   Spotify is no different than decisions
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.520]   that Facebook has had to make.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.680]   Twitter has had to make, as Jason has pointed out.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.160]   Except for the relationship that you pointed out, Leo,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.320]   where there-- as you say, there's more of a partnership
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   here between Spotify.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.240]   They're not just publishing his podcast.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   They own his podcast, which gives them
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.320]   a higher responsibility, I would say, right?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.720]   Not from a legal standpoint.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.080]   From a legal standpoint, they just have to decide
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.400]   if they can weather this storm of the adverse public opinion,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.240]   other artists pulling out.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.280]   I see also Joni Mitchell and Nils Loffgren have jumped in
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.120]   and said, yeah, we're going to pull our content.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.240]   So it's kind of like the whole close your account
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.800]   movement with Facebook.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.320]   How much of that are they willing to--
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.840]   sorry, meta.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.680]   How much of that are they willing to put up with?
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.960]   And how much do they think they can
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:21.600]   weather of that kind of adverse, both financial impact directly
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.840]   from what they're able to offer on their platform?
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.560]   And also the adverse public opinion.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.880]   Do people really want to support the platform?
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.080]   The adverse stock price impact.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.320]   So there's a lot there they're going to have to make
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.600]   some business decisions about.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.920]   I hope they have a good crisis PR firm, good crisis management
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.680]   team on board to help them make these decisions.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.160]   And I think Jason's dead on that they're
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.400]   going to have to act responsibly, not just to manage
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.960]   public opinion and their bottom line,
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.400]   but lingering out there in the background,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.000]   even though there's no legal requirement
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.160]   that I can think of right now.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.040]   Certainly there have been rumblings among congresspeople.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.760]   The Surgeon General of the United States
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.640]   has made several statements about misinformation
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.280]   and their lack of patience for it.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.240]   This is somewhat more complicated because while some of us
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.600]   might say saying the vaccine doesn't work and don't do it
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.800]   is misinformation, others say it's just an opinion.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.720]   And so it's a little different public health
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.640]   because yes, it's just an opinion.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.680]   But if it's an opinion that is wrong from the terms
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.760]   of public health, then it's more than just an opinion.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.720]   I think the Surgeon General of the United States would say so.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.280]   And that's what they have to get out in front of and not
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.600]   be the poster child for some sort of regulatory action
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.960]   or congressional action that is meant to curb this kind of thing.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.240]   Well, how could Congress weigh in?
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.640]   I mean, doesn't the First Amendment protect Spotify
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.120]   just as much as it does, Joe Rogan?
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:15.960]   So yes, you raise a good point that Congress is not
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.880]   going to be able to do content.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.200]   I guess thrown out in court immediately.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.960]   Yes, I think that Congress is less of a threat.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.640]   But you're right, there are limits to the First Amendment.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.200]   And if it is a public health consideration that is decided,
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.360]   yes, it would face a First Amendment challenge.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.480]   But I think it would be, if you could demonstrably
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.840]   say that this is adverse to public health,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:46.320]   that a court could very much uphold whatever was put in place.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.960]   If I were Spotify, I would certainly
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.760]   want to get out in front of this.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.600]   Well, Daniel Eck did publish a long piece today,
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.680]   probably written by Crisis PR, a Crisis PR firm,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.440]   in which he said any Crisis PR firm would say he should say,
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.200]   we haven't been transparent around the policies that
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.600]   guide our content more broadly.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.120]   But we have had rules in years for place, sorry,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.320]   we haven't been more clear.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.640]   Today we're publishing our long-standing platform rules,
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.680]   which apparently they had never published before.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.480]   We're working, and this is, I guess, the response.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.040]   And I think this is probably the right response.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.840]   We're working to add a content advisory to any podcast
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.760]   episode that includes a discussion about COVID-19,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.240]   directing listeners to our dedicated COVID-19 hub, which
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.360]   provides access to, he says, data-driven facts.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.680]   I've always thought maybe the thing to do
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.320]   is just to say, right at the beginning of the Joe Rogan show,
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.200]   hey, Joe Rogan's a comedian, and his opinions
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.560]   and opinions of his guests are his own,
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.960]   please consult your physician before believing them
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.160]   or something.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.000]   Right.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.840]   I mean, there was a time back last fall
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.560]   when people were kind of feeling this way about Fox News
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.600]   as well.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.280]   There were some commentators who had gone on that network
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.880]   and said some things that I think prompted the surgeon
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   general to come out and say, hey, we need some more
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.920]   responsibility around the information that's being put out
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.440]   there.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.120]   But I think he raised a really good point, too, Leo,
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.080]   is that here we are.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.440]   This is a different format.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:32.080]   Podcasting is not a largely scripted medium,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.720]   although there's a lot of scripted podcasting out there.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.800]   But when you're talking about discussion and people
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.040]   sitting around a table or a virtual table, as in our case
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.760]   here, trying to wrap their head around the issues of the day
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.240]   and doing their best with that, even if they're sort of fumbling
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.360]   and stumbling along and they don't get everything right,
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.720]   there's value to that, too.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.240]   There's also-- and I probably should have said this--
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.520]   in the contract language that says
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.920]   Spotify has exclusive distribution rights,
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.360]   but does not own the show, which gives them
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.400]   a little bit of a distance from the show.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.360]   Harry, what should Spotify have done?
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.240]   Should they put a disclaimer on there?
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.280]   Should they take it down?
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.680]   Should they ignore it and just say, hey, it's a podcast?
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.200]   Anything goes.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.800]   I mean, my guess is that the stuff that Daniel is saying
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.200]   today won't make anybody terribly happy.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.040]   And what it reminds me of is what the YouTubes of the world
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.400]   were doing a year, do a year and a half ago.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.160]   They started out initially saying that we will put labels
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.520]   on stuff and direct people to health information pages.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.800]   And when they did that, it really
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.200]   didn't make anybody terribly happy,
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.920]   and they ended up tightening the screws a lot more
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.360]   on misinformation.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.800]   I think it's possible that Spotify will have to do that, too.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.480]   I know some people thought that Neil Young expected
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.520]   that Spotify might choose him over Joe Rogan, which
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.320]   was not going to happen.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   It seemed a lot more like--
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.120]   They call his bluff right away on that one.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.600]   Well, he really raised the visibility
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.760]   of every discussion now because he did that.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.920]   And because people at Joannie Mitchell, who also
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.880]   had polio, being of the same age group as Neil Young,
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.320]   reacted to what he did.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.920]   And it really feels a little bit like Spotify, who
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.560]   has this heritage in music, which is usually a bit less
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   controversial than spoken word content,
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.080]   is still sort of catching up with where the rest of the internet
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.560]   was a lot earlier in the pandemic.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.760]   And I think the response to the artist is interesting
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.760]   because it's not like Twitter or YouTube.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.920]   It's a little bit like YouTube.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.120]   But really, the artists are what makes Spotify money.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.880]   And so Spotify's reluctance to censor Joe Rogan
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.040]   because he makes them a lot of money,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   and they spend a lot of money for the podcast,
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.160]   is offset by other artists saying, well,
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.120]   you can't make money on my stuff in that case.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.040]   And that actually is hitting Spotify where they live.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.600]   I wonder, I think Neil Young probably
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.880]   knew his voice alone was insufficient,
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.840]   but probably hoped that others would follow his lead.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.200]   And that all that would be left on Spotify
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.800]   is Kid Rock, Ted Nugent, and the Mormon tabernacle choir.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.600]   I don't know.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.800]   It's an interesting situation.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.200]   It's just another case, like Twitter, like YouTube,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.400]   where these platforms are challenged.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.480]   And then, of course, it always becomes so politicized.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.360]   And I think that's interesting, too.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.440]   It's become about politics, not about public health,
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.280]   not about what's right or wrong,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.120]   but just what's politically expedient.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.480]   I think--
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.920]   Yes, as more shoes will drop, I mean,
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.440]   it seems pretty unthinkable that this couldn't evolve.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.720]   And he can break up with Joe Rogan.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.680]   But more stuff could happen.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.160]   We have no idea about the conversations going on
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.400]   behind the scenes at Spotify, and we might never know those.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.760]   And I don't--
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.240]   I don't--
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.600]   Joe Rogan double down on the stuff.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.000]   Will he pull back?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.160]   That's an interesting question.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.240]   I wonder if Danielette called Joe and said,
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.840]   hey, it would be nice if, in this episode,
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.640]   you might say something like, hey, I'm just a comedian.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.000]   You should probably consult a variety of sources
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.680]   before you decide what to do.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.800]   There are people-- I know people who
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.360]   aren't getting vaccines because of Joe Rogan.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:28.640]   Wow.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.600]   He's really influential.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.840]   He's very influential.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.200]   He also sells vitamins.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.240]   He also sells products that claim to boost your immune system.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.040]   He's kind of promoting his own commercial interest
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.240]   in this a little bit as well, which I think is reprehensible.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.880]   I have a question I'd like to ask you all about this.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.320]   Why isn't Apple having this problem?
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.520]   Well, obviously, they don't have Joe Rogan on board,
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:50.960]   but they also host--
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.440]   Well, that's the difference, isn't it?
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.280]   So Spotify is just a directory of podcasts.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.320]   Apple's just a directory of podcasts.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.280]   So Apple, I think--
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.560]   I don't know, rightly or wrongly says, well, he's not our boy.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.560]   But they did pull Alex Jones down.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.000]   It took a long time and a lot of pressure.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.920]   And Apple was tweeting about the fact
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.120]   that they still have all the Neil Young you can listen to.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.720]   So they had a little fun--
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.800]   They jumped on that one.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.320]   They said, oh, yeah, we're the home of Neil Young.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.760]   I mean, a lot of people have pointed out
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.840]   that you can listen to Steve Bannon by going to Apple Podcasts,
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.320]   which is-- I mean, you might be able to make the case
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.800]   that you shouldn't be able to do that.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.440]   But it's quite different, given that Steve Bannon is not
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.880]   a content partner of Apple or their signature podcast.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.080]   And they're just really pointing to it in the way
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.800]   that Google points to reprehensible websites.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.320]   It's part of the new world, because when media was controlled
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.480]   by big companies, you could hold-- you could say, well,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.760]   if the New York Times publishes an article that's bad,
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.080]   we can go after them.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.520]   But podcasts, most for the most part, are not owned by anybody.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.760]   These companies would like to say, well, we're just a directory.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:10.840]   But the minute Apple pulls down Alex Jones, suddenly,
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.320]   it's not just a directory anymore.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.800]   They're making editorial decisions.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.680]   So they kind of opened up this Pandora's box.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.880]   I, for one, don't want to see any company like Apple or Spotify
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.640]   or Microsoft or any company have the power
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.760]   to say to an independent podcast, you may not exist.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.520]   Google has that power for websites.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.560]   You may not exist.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.640]   Nobody can find you.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.920]   By the way, I should also point out, Neil Young hated,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.400]   at least for a long time, hated Apple because of the quality
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.960]   of the music.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.760]   He said, never listen to iTunes.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.360]   My song sound terrible on iTunes.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.920]   Maybe that's changed now that Apple does lossless as well.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.800]   But--
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.520]   Ponyo wasn't that the name of it.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.000]   Ponyo player.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.840]   Yeah, I have a Ponyo player.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.320]   Neil Young--
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.240]   It's a wonderful idea.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.840]   Actually, the company has placed a playlist of Neil Young's music
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:09.040]   I hear right into the browse section right under We Love Neil.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.040]   Oh my goodness.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   So that's just blatant commercialism.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.640]   That's just blatant like--
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.000]   that's not saying we love vaccines.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.360]   I swear.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.520]   I mean, there's plenty of crazy stuff on Apple's podcast.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.400]   As there should be.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.040]   Directory.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.000]   Don't you think?
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.840]   There should be.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.960]   I don't want Apple to decide what you can hear.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.760]   Somebody else.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.120]   Right.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   Exactly.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.160]   So I think where there's a couple factors here.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:42.480]   One is that it is the fact that Spotify owns it,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.920]   as you said, Leo.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.600]   They don't-- again, they don't own it.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.720]   They only own exclusive rights to distribute.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.120]   Sorry.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.640]   Thank you.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.360]   And that's a big distinction.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.720]   It's not their show.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.760]   They just have exclusive distribution.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   They sign a deal with Joe, saying, oh, no one else to carry in.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   It's a little closer relationship than them just
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.960]   listing it in their director.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   That's right.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.520]   So there is that piece.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.960]   And then there's the fundamental issue of freedom, right?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.520]   We all have a certain amount of freedom
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.320]   until that freedom infringes on somebody else's freedom
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.040]   or affects somebody else in a negative way.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.840]   And so that's written into all of these principles
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.360]   going back to some of the foundations of the idea
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:33.640]   of democracy and representative democracy and republics
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.200]   and freedoms and all of these things.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.440]   And so there was no problem with this
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.120]   until it started having a lot of negative effects
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.080]   on a lot of people.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.960]   And people are literally getting sick and dying
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.720]   because of some of the things that Rogan is saying.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.960]   And it would be one thing if what he was saying was true.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   But because there's also an aspect of there's some creative
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.720]   facts in what he's doing, then he has a certain--
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.520]   from just a societal standpoint,
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.480]   he has a certain responsibility that is sort of being
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.760]   misapplied and is hurting people.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.440]   Actually, and you're the first person to actually say,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.920]   it falls on Joe's shoulders, not spotify.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.280]   It falls on Rogan's shoulders, right?
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.320]   Well, I'm sure they're having some conversations
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.680]   along those lines.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.240]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.680]   Spotify and Joe.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.160]   That's an interesting point to make.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.840]   I kind of want to defend Rogan's right to say whatever
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.280]   the hell stupid thing he wants to say.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.960]   I would hate to see the show pulled down for that reason.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.880]   That's why I like a disclaimer.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.520]   By the way--
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.360]   Let's say--
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.560]   Let's be clear.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.200]   Even if it is pulled down, the freedom of speech
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.880]   part comes in of like it's not his right to be on Spotify.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.200]   He can't shut fire in a crowded theater.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.840]   It's his right, so he can go and I'm
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.880]   sure if Spotify were to stop it, I'm
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.240]   sure he'd just spin up his own site and potentially
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   put it--
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.960]   offer it directly or offered it on another platform.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.440]   Or he has a big enough audience that people would probably
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.920]   just go to JoeRogan.com and watch the show every day
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.840]   or whatever they--
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.320]   Well, let's not forget.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.360]   Joe Rogan's a UFC commentator, former host of The Man
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.360]   Show.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.600]   He's a comic.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.040]   You know, and comics say stupid things all the time.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:43.840]   John Gruber pointed out that if Spotify were to kill their deal
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.040]   with Joe Rogan, he'd be available on every podcast player
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.080]   and in all likelihood he'd have a larger audience.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.560]   He does.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:49.880]   Right.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.680]   And he does now.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.080]   And therefore, if you are not crazy about him spreading
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.720]   this message, him being--
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.880]   and Spotify exclusive is probably a good thing
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.840]   in terms of tamping it down, at least a tiny bit.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.040]   That's a good point.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.720]   He wasn't hurting before the Spotify deal.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.520]   Well, here is a data point from the Verge's HotPod, which
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.240]   covers this medium.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.200]   They talk to an ad buyer who also requested anonymity
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.440]   to speak freely about rates that says Spotify upped prices
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.760]   for all of its acquired and licensed shows.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.960]   A host read ad on Joe Rogan's show used to cost--
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:30.160]   kind of ads we do-- tens of thousands of dollars prior
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.440]   to him going exclusive to Spotify.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.680]   Next year to get an ad on this year,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.040]   I guess it would be now, on the Joe Rogan experience,
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:44.880]   the minimum spend $1 million CPMs of upward of $60.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.440]   That's actually not a super high CPM.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.480]   But if he has 11 million listeners,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.120]   that's why it's $1 million.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.960]   So even if they paid him $100 million,
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.160]   all it's going to take is $100 an ad.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.080]   And they're back, baby.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.320]   Less than a year's worth of advertising.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.240]   So he's worth a lot of money to Spotify.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.120]   And the other reason Spotify's been spending this kind of money
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.440]   is because the music industry has kind of had a chokehold on them.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.000]   The music industry is who decides
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.120]   what Spotify is going to pay artists,
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   whether they're going to get the artists at all.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.600]   Spotify was looking for something they could own that would
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.720]   be out of the hands of the music industry
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.760]   and podcasts were their next great hope.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.960]   And apparently, if they're charging a million dollars for an ad
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.880]   on Rogan, that was a good thing to do.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.880]   That's an amazing number.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.160]   All right.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.320]   I like to think most people are smart enough to know that you
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.520]   should not get your facts from the Joe Rogan show.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.920]   Like it's an entertainment medium.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.400]   That said, there are, like you said,
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.120]   there are people out there that are not getting--
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.440]   You know where it's--
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.760]   It's not somebody's going, I don't know what to think.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.240]   Let me ask Joe Rogan.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.280]   It's not that.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.040]   It's more to somebody who's leaning in that direction anyway.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.840]   And then Rogan gives them the strength, the power,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.880]   and maybe some information to do that.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.000]   Well, if you're young, he says, if you're young,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.480]   your immune system's good, you shouldn't get the vaccine.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.000]   You don't need to get the vaccine.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.960]   And somebody who's leaning that way anyway,
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.200]   that's just all they need to say.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.520]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.360]   I didn't want it anyway.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.320]   I don't think he's convincing people.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.800]   Confirmation of existing biases.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.760]   That's exactly right.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.320]   Yes.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.400]   Yeah, I just don't want to see censorship.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.320]   Because I just put myself in that, what if all of a sudden
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.360]   all of these companies said, we don't like people advocating
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.760]   masks and vaccines.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.040]   We're going to keep you off the air, Leo.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.320]   I would be upset.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.240]   And rightly so, right?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:55.760]   Of course.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.480]   So I don't know if--
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.920]   so I can see myself in the other side of this one.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.640]   I have a feeling it's not the last you're going to hear about it.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.040]   Denise Howell is here.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.640]   It's great to see you.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.800]   How's the business going?
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.600]   Tell me the name of it again.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.520]   Fits with fits.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.440]   Fits with fit.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.080]   Is a secondhand clothing experiment
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.400]   that I was dabbling in.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.560]   I don't know that I'm going to continue dabbling in it.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.360]   I don't know.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.200]   I'm trying to--
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.160]   I'm at a juncture, Leo, where my kid is about to graduate
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:31.960]   from high school.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.440]   What?
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.320]   And I'm doing a lot of self-assessment.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:35.840]   What?
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.240]   What's next kind of stuff, so?
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.000]   Well, he's going to be moving out soon, Denise.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.200]   Empty nest.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.240]   I can't believe your son is ready to graduate from high school.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.640]   He was this tall.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.960]   He was just a little guy.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.440]   I know.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.440]   Well, look at Henry.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.440]   I know.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:50.960]   I know.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.680]   My daughter turns 30 in a couple of months.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.440]   That's crazy.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:53.920]   That's insane.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.320]   I can't believe that's 30.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.880]   That's incredible.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.040]   Insane.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.680]   Well, I love the idea and I love your style.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   So I hope you keep doing something with style.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.360]   I look a bit like an Irish fisherman today.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.600]   I know.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.480]   Thanks a lot.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   But no, apparently that's the sweater.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.760]   Do you know about that?
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.080]   The sweater?
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.680]   No, I don't know about the sweater.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.080]   Oh, well, I'm trying to remember what show it was where he's wearing a ratty old sweater,
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   but it became like the thing.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.120]   It was an Irish fisherman's sweater.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.320]   And it was some of the young people we have on the show told me about the sweater.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.880]   I think it was Christina Warren.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.040]   I can't remember this story.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   But anyway, it's good to have you and your sweater on the show.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:37.560]   Thank you.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.360]   You're a great package.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.160]   Harry McCracken, thank you for being here.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.000]   Always great to see you.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.160]   And of course, to the new editor chief of CDNet, Big Shot Jason Heiner.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.360]   Great to have all three of you.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.160]   I showed it they brought to you by, I love this.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.160]   I don't know if you've tried this.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   It's so cool.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.800]   Imperfect foods.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.520]   This was a company that was started on a, I think a premise that I really like, which
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:07.600]   is that a lot of the US food supply just gets thrown out or fed to animals because it doesn't
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:16.120]   fit our conception of a perfect food, an apple that's perfect and bread or a pomegranate
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.160]   at the size of your head or a carrot that doesn't look like Richard Nixon.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.560]   But that's good food.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.400]   Imperfect foods was started to eliminate all that food waste that's going up.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   I didn't know this.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:33.800]   35%, more than a third of the food supply in the US goes unsold or uneaten because grocers
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   won't carry it.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.840]   Because it just doesn't look perfect.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.960]   Well you can help with imperfect foods.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.320]   You'll reduce food waste.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:48.840]   You'll save your own time on grocery shopping and you'll eat more fresh and delicious food.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.240]   And it really, they call it imperfect.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.040]   Some of it, I admit those little apples, they're like the ones I used to get that fell off the
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.040]   apple tree.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.840]   They're sweeter than the giant apples.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.920]   They have more flavor.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:06.440]   They don't want to carry them because they're not shelf perfect for 100 days or whatever.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.280]   Imperfect foods, sources foods that would otherwise fall through the cracks and brings
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.560]   it to you.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:17.600]   It's a great way for you to do something, save money, save driving.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.560]   It's a grocery delivery service that offers not just fruits and vegetables but an entire
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.400]   line of sustainable groceries that taste delicious and reduce waste.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.400]   Stuff that the grocers couldn't sell.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.120]   That kind of thing.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.840]   We get heritage chickens from imperfect foods.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.520]   And I guess they're too small for the grocer wants giant breasts.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.880]   But they're the most flavorful.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.960]   It's all we'll eat now.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   It's incredible.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.480]   They're heritage delicious chickens.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.080]   I love imperfect foods.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.600]   First thing to do is go and see if they deliver your area because I'm sad to say even though
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.960]   I'm a big fan and they deliver here, they don't deliver everywhere.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.160]   So go to imperfectfoods.com.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.000]   Once you sign up, you can personalize, it's a weekly grocery order, fresh seasonal produce,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.560]   pantry staples, yummy snacks, saves us a lot of grocery shopping time.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.280]   You get your order on the same day every week which is nice, makes it easy to plan ours
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.280]   as Thursday.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:15.680]   But one of the reasons they do that is to deliver weekly by neighborhood to reduce emissions.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.600]   So their trucks produce 25 to 75 percent fewer emissions than individual trips if you had
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.520]   to go to the grocery store.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.160]   And imperfect foods customers on average save six to eight pounds of food that would just
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.560]   be thrown out with every order.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.080]   Plus say goodbye to packaging guilt.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.480]   That's always something I worry about with food delivery services.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.880]   We used to get it from a grocery store.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.360]   Everything had come in big plastic bags.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.440]   No, imperfect foods is the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.360]   your package after every order.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.680]   It's cardboard for the most part.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.320]   Very, very little plastic.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.000]   I really love imperfect foods.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.080]   If you want to try it, if I've convinced you and look at the website, I'll probably give
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.200]   you some even more ideas.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.440]   Go to imperfectfoods.com.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:05.040]   We're going to get you 20 percent off your first four orders if you use the promo code
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.040]   TWIT.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   Imperfectfoods.com, promo code TWIT.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:15.200]   20 percent off your first four orders, that's up to an $80 value at imperfectfoods.com.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.360]   And trust me, I think you're going to love it.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.040]   I think you're going to, I really, I'm so happy with it.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   Go code TWIT.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.520]   Join the movement.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.800]   Really love these guys.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.240]   Let's see.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   Let's see.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.400]   Let's move on to another topic.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.520]   No more flock.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:43.560]   Google, I just, I don't get Google.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.920]   They're just, there's something there.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.480]   Anyway, they were going to, they said they announced publicly, no more three-third party
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.640]   cookies, then advertisers said, yeah, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, how
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.100]   he's supposed to target ads?
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:37:04.920]   So Google announced the federated learning of cohorts, which is the worst retronium ever.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:12.560]   They have now announced that, no, that didn't work.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.160]   So they've scrapped flock.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.240]   And now they're back with something called topics.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:27.480]   The EFF, when flock was in, the flock was never really, I mean, it was in beta.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:33.340]   The idea of it was your browser would observe your habits and put you in a cohort.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.400]   They never said how big the cohorts were, how many cohorts there were, but essentially
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:44.120]   a cohort of types that when you went to somebody's webpage, they could request your flock ID,
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.880]   which would, by the way, change every few weeks based on your browser usage.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.240]   And then they would know what kind of ads to show you.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.680]   So the idea was it's a more impersonal way of targeting ads.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.360]   The EFF and others said, well, we know how de-anonymizing works.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.800]   It's probably not anonymous.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.880]   They found all sorts of problems.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.840]   Eventually Google just said, all right, fine.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.400]   We're going to do topics instead.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:16.480]   Again, you have to be using Chrome, although Chrome is about 63% of the world browser market.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.680]   I think it's even more in the United States.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:28.120]   Chrome will watch what you do and group you into a topic.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.480]   One of the things about topics Google likes is there aren't topics for sensitive topics
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:40.600]   like mental health or drugs or whatever Google can eliminate topics that it doesn't want
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.040]   advertising based on guns, things like that.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.880]   And they think maybe it'll be more anonymous because it changes, it rotates.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.200]   I think the problem Google has is on the one hand, they hear people like us say privacy,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.880]   privacy, privacy.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:02.280]   And the other hand, they hear advertisers saying, but we want to know more about people.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.400]   Is topics a good replacement for Flock Denise?
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.800]   I like where they're going.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.880]   I mean, it depends how much you trust Google when they say things like, we're doing this,
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.760]   I'm paraphrasing now, we're doing this out in the open.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.280]   Flock was a trial, we learned a lot from it.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   Here's a direct quote from Google's privacy sandbox lead, Ben Galbraith.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.560]   He says, topics replaces our Flock proposal.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.400]   And I want to emphasize that this whole process of sharing a proposal, doing a trial, gathering
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.160]   feedback and then iterating on the designs, this is the whole open development process
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.160]   that we wanted for the sandbox and really shows the process working as intended.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   We meant to do this.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.160]   We meant to do this.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   Right.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   Right.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.480]   So I mean, you can take that with a grain of salt, but I mean, if they're sincere, then
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.800]   then, you know, that is how things should work.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.600]   In the defense, they have been doing it in the open and people responded and they said,
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.360]   okay, we'll try something else.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   So.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.360]   Right.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   Exactly.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.920]   So the problem that they have that you haven't mentioned yet that has advertisers up in arms
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:18.600]   is they're still concerned about Google having all this data itself and it being the gatekeeper
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.800]   for all things targeted advertising.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.760]   That's not making third parties happy who also want to be able to do effective targeted
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   advertising.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:35.680]   But, you know, I mean, I do think that they're innovating in this area and that I'd rather
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:44.440]   actually get an ad that was based on some sort of topical basis rather than, you know,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.560]   all the creepy other ways that has targeted.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:52.920]   And, you know, I've always said top, you want target, people should want targeted ads.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.160]   It's a waste of your time to see ads for things you don't care about.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:02.960]   I don't need to see barbed wire ads because I'm not a barbed wire buyer.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   Google is, I have to say, probably partly aware of the fact that their dominance in
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.840]   advertising is slipping.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.400]   Not only is it is Facebook a challenge, but so is Amazon, so is Apple.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.040]   All of a sudden they're not the only place you can go to get targeted ads.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.880]   So I think they're very reluctant to stop doing some sort of targeting because Facebook's
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.320]   sitting there going, we'll target all you want, whatever you want to know.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   We'll tell you anything.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.560]   This is a fine line.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.920]   They have to tread given all their antitrust concerns in both the US and abroad.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   Right.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   Right.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:46.080]   In fact, the bill that Amy Klodchar and Marcia Blackburn's bill to get companies to stop self-dealing
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   Google, it's good to say Google, Amazon has now gotten out of the judiciary committee
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:57.400]   and could be brought to the floor of the Senate any time now.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.240]   So yeah, Google's right to be a little bit worried about this.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:05.080]   Harry, where do you fall on the privacy spectrum here?
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.440]   Well, should targeted advertising exist at all?
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.360]   I mean, like you say, there are some value and seen ads that there's at least some chance
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.920]   they might be useful to you.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.560]   What's worrisome is just the degree to watch at Google and advertisers and other companies
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:26.880]   have gotten so unbelievably sophisticated at crawling through what you're doing online
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:32.280]   and assembling a really detailed profile of you that you don't really know that, you
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.480]   know, what it consists of, how long they're going to keep it.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.480]   Flocks seem to be at least a little bit of a move in the right direction and topics seem
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:46.760]   a little bit better just in terms of making it possible to target you without doing such
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.880]   a deep dive and stuff about you in such a secretive way.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:56.360]   I do think a lot of this is completely outside of Google's control, though.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.960]   It may be that one of the reasons why Flock did not take off is because Google was so
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.800]   completely unsuccessful in getting other browser companies to want to be involved with
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   that.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.720]   And that's hugely surprising given that they don't have quite as much invested in ad targeting
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.520]   as Google does.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.560]   And whether or not anybody else will sign on for topics.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   I don't know.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.880]   I haven't seen any news about whether the other browser companies are enthusiastic about it.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.600]   But if it's a Chrome only thing, it seems like it's nowhere near as powerful as if it
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.200]   does become a little bit of an industry standard.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.920]   Jason, I know you don't sell ads.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.320]   And you probably your office is way down the hall from the guy in charge of that.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:45.920]   But you know, a lot of the publications you've worked at forever are ad supported, certainly
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.000]   mine are.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.760]   I am somewhat sympathetic to I don't think we need to target quite as much as we have
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.760]   been.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.600]   But I understand why advertisers don't want to waste ads spend either.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.280]   And ads are important to your business as they are mine.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   For sure.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.600]   And I mean, for two decades, I've been working in ad supported media.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:14.040]   So I wouldn't do that if I didn't think that there was some value that users get from
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.840]   well targeted ads.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:23.840]   As you said, much better than sort of general things that many of which they don't need.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.720]   And so because of that, when you're seeing a lot of ads you don't need, that typically
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.760]   means like a publisher is going to then show you a lot more ads to try to find one.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   Like, right?
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:35.760]   Good points.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.200]   So one targeted ad is supposed to 100 untargeted ads.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.440]   That's a very good point.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   That's right.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   So that's a good thing.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:52.560]   I do fundamentally believe that the solution to this is not finding these like little ways
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:57.720]   behind the scenes to try to, you know, engineer better systems.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:05.800]   I know this is a traditional view, but I feel like the best way to do it for a publisher
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.640]   is to create a relationship, a deeper relationship with your audience to give them something that
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.480]   makes the relationship so that they want to log in.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.600]   They want to be a subscriber.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.880]   And when they're a subscriber, they get a better experience.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:28.640]   And then they get more targeted ads because they are tacitly or not tacitly there directly
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:35.880]   giving you information to say, I understand that you and trust that you will give me a
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.620]   better targeted ad and a better experience by being logged in and giving you my subscriber
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.620]   data.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.640]   I think that's the core.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:52.720]   Now, what happens instead is those folks that are the most loyal, that are the most
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:46:00.240]   logged in, that are the most, the ones that turn the most traffic and are the most engaged,
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.860]   we tend to take them for granted.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.020]   And so because of that, we don't give them that experience.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:09.900]   And instead we say, oh, well, we're going to try to find a way to monetize every user
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.960]   by doing cookies and that kind of thing.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.840]   So I believe that as an industry, we dropped the ball on this a long time ago.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:23.560]   And that's why there was a user revolt against cookies and rightly so.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.720]   And the come umpits has come on that.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.280]   And now I do believe that the answer is not to find other sneaky ways around this digital
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.640]   fingerprinting and that kind of thing.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:40.580]   But instead it's to actually reengage with users and to give them an engaged experience
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:45.380]   where they'll want to give you more data and grow trust.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.140]   I think that's the only way forward.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:52.020]   Things like this, like flock and topics are helpful, but they're mostly helpful for the
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:57.420]   large group of users who are not logged in, who you don't have a deeper relationship with
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.260]   and who you're still trying to make a little bit of money off of.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:08.320]   Yeah, we, I mean, you and I are in a similar boat where our stuff is really targeted at
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.920]   my case tech enthusiast audience.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.600]   So in a way, everything we do is targeted.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.440]   And so our advertisers kind of know what they're getting.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:24.040]   Yeah, I'd love to push back on what Jason just said that that's got to be the way forward.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:29.360]   And I'm wondering if there's a way forward that could involve less data collection from
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.160]   any of the users.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:37.140]   And maybe this is just, you know, because I'm deeply impacted by the fact that I've been
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.760]   involved with the Twit Network since, you know, almost its inception.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.080]   And this is the way you've always done ads, Leo.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.660]   But I think it's so effective too.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:51.240]   Instead of having targeted ads, have curated ads that they add, you just read that imperfect
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.240]   foods.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.240]   I'm writing down the code.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.960]   I'm going, oh, that's just a great idea.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.040]   I'm totally going to sign up for that.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.480]   And I think there are a lot of people out there that would love for there to be a way
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:07.560]   for them to receive ads, not just on podcasts, but in their browsing experience, that someone
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.720]   had selected because they think this is a good product, good service, valuable, it's
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.800]   been vetted somehow.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.720]   You know, and it's not necessarily the thing that you're out there searching for, but it's
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.600]   the thing you might need anyway.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.960]   It's not going to work for everybody though.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:28.720]   I mean, if you're Coca-Cola or Budweiser, you're not targeted, right?
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.420]   You're a brand advertising.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:35.080]   So then you just buy, you know, football games because you want the biggest numbers.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080]   So I guess that's okay.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:41.200]   I mean, we'll never get those advertisers.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.320]   People I think part of this is people just hate ads.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.320]   That's part of the problem.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.880]   And there's nothing we could do about that if we're ad supported.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.840]   What we did is we started Club Twit so that people who really hate ads, you just buy a
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.720]   membership and then never hear an ad again.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.800]   That's one way to do it.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   I don't know.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:06.240]   I've, Corey Doctorow calls ad blockers the largest consumer boycott of all time because
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.120]   so many people use them now and don't ever see ads or hear ads.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.440]   And that's kind of, that makes it more.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:17.200]   Part of the reason, part of the reason for that is that not only are you receiving ads
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:24.320]   that infringe on your privacy so that they can serve you a certain ad, but the whole
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:29.240]   experience is so awful when you get six pop ups in a video and it's slowing down your
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:35.280]   browsing and, you know, there's just no, there's no incentive to allow them to keep
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.760]   invading your life.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   They're so bad.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.600]   I like to just push back though too.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   So I'd go ahead, Corey.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:46.080]   I was just going to say like last week I was researching a new pair of glasses.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.960]   And so I looked at the site of a eyeglasses company that should remain nameless.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.480]   Although its initials are W.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   We know who they are.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:00.440]   And then I went out and bought them, but I'm still getting these freaking ads for the
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:06.040]   exact model that I've been researching on almost every page on the internet.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.880]   And I have no idea how to get rid of them.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   That's part of the problem.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.960]   It's the least useful ad in the world.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.640]   It's such a crappy system.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   It doesn't work well.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.480]   Why does Amazon keep trying to tell me the thing I just bought?
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.160]   Amazon, you want to know of all people.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.520]   I just bought that.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:30.200]   I do like, I want to follow up and say like, I like Denise's pushback on this because I
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:38.560]   was just, I was thinking about the fact that you all very nicely, Leo, like your team sent
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.520]   me an invitation to club twit.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:48.240]   And I actually haven't activated because when I listen to your shows, especially like this
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:57.280]   show, maybe most of all, this version of your many shows, I want to hear the ad because
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:01.320]   you actually have some good stuff on here.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:07.080]   And I can't tell you how many times I bought whatever dang thing it is.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.440]   You know what's funny?
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   You're not alone.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:15.320]   There's actually people in club twit who complained and we actually have a, an, our discord server,
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:21.560]   a channel that's called all the ads that's the, if you want to listen to the ads, that
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:26.000]   you're not getting in your club twit version of the feed, you can, you can get them here.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.600]   I have one more things off of this show than literally anything else that I consume.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.560]   I don't know if you're just being nice.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.560]   You're really good.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.560]   I'm not just being nice.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.840]   I truly mean that.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.760]   So that's why I was, I was, you know, I was grok in the feedback.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.640]   You're going to like actually all four advertisers today.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.360]   This is unusual.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.680]   And this is by the way, one of the things has changed are what we call B2C, their consumer
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.520]   products.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.600]   One of the things has really changed, maybe it's because of COVID in our business.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:04.440]   I think it's also because publications like E-Week and PC Week are gone.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.680]   And so it's hard for enterprise businesses to reach other enterprises.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.320]   Like if you're a security company selling security software, where you go, you write
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.960]   their binads on CNN, like that's the audience you want.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:20.960]   So we're doing more and more of that kind of B2B, business to business advertising,
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.920]   which I don't have the same affinity for.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.680]   I really, because I'm not the business.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.120]   I'm not somebody buying it.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:34.400]   But that's because we're targeted in the same way PC Week and E-Week were targeted.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.880]   That's how that's how PC Week and E-Week were free.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.120]   Because they knew they were reaching the audience that those advertisers wanted.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.600]   That seems to me a good model.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.280]   I know it doesn't work for everybody, but it seems to me a good model.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.560]   Yeah, but you're not targeted in a creepy way, which is nice.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.560]   Right.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.000]   We're targeted because we know you like tech because you're listening to the show for
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   great art.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Right.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Well, self-select in the place.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Self-selecting.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Yes.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.920]   And I echo Jason, there are so many things I bought from the ads on our various shows
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   that have vastly improved my life.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:10.800]   The trend is away from that, and I'm not, here I am, I'm an old-timer in podcasting.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.320]   You know, the way it used to be.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:19.080]   But what's happening in podcasting, now partly because of Spotify, big part because of Spotify,
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.040]   is no more host read ads.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.120]   They're injected.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.640]   It's direct ad insertion where it's programmatically injected.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.520]   And that's by the way, partly because podcasts can't track you.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:35.720]   But at least if you're downloading, when you, your ads are literally injected in when you
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.760]   download the podcast, because then they know your IP address and they at least can geo-target
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   you.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.160]   And if they have other information, they might know who you are.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:47.440]   And so then those ads are much more targeted than the ads when you buy a Twitter ad you're
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.200]   buying, you know, anybody who listens to this show.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.600]   And that's the trend, which means, and this is why I hate ad targeting.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.040]   It brings the whole thing down.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.480]   It makes advertising worse, not better.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.000]   How so?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.960]   Because instead of these human crafted ads aimed at an audience that would be interested
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:15.600]   in the show, the ads that you say work, you're just going to get an injected ad that was
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.840]   recorded by somebody else based on your IP address.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.720]   And I don't, well, maybe they are more effective.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.880]   That's what everybody's buying now.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.120]   But I think it's not that they're more effective.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:31.360]   It's that that's what happens when you start going down the road of ad targeting.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.760]   Advertisers think that's what they want.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.200]   It's certainly easier for agencies to sell.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.600]   So that's how the advertising goes.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:44.080]   And it's a vicious circle because then those ads are less appealing.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.680]   And so people block them more.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.560]   They don't like them as much.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:52.000]   So then just as you said, Jason, when they start not reading them or seeing them, you
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.720]   got to buy more ads, it's a bad direction.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:02.000]   I think we have hit on a business model somebody needs to create, which is curated advertising.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   Yeah, that's what we do.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   You know, I am agreed to get the ads.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   And it's artisanal advertising.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   I think there's a company with that.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.560]   It works great at Twit scale.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.560]   And that's the problem.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.040]   And the scale of many podcasts, the question is, is there any way to scale that up to Google
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.040]   scale?
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:27.560]   The original Google advertising approach was fantastic back when it was pretty much purely
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:33.840]   about you go to Google, you search for something, and you see text ads next to your search results
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.600]   relating to the terms you searched for.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.000]   That was in some ways the most perfect form of advertising ever invented.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.480]   But what Google is doing today is so much more complex and complicated and vase of than
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.480]   that ever was.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.520]   And they're losing, they can't win that game against Facebook.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.520]   Right.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:55.920]   Ultimately, Facebook has so much more data.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.840]   And they have shown that they have no qualms in using it.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:05.320]   And then they make it because they can target you so narrowly.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.280]   It's also incredibly cheap, right?
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:12.320]   You can only, you can target the ones that you want and you don't have to pay for the
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.080]   ones that you don't want.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.760]   And because of that, the economies of scale are ridiculous.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.000]   Doesn't Google still do search ads though?
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.320]   I mean, that's still the bulk of their businesses.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.280]   The bulk of their revenue.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:30.080]   That experience has gotten way worse lately too though because quite often out, the ads
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:35.280]   take up the entire page above the scroll in a way they never did before.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.080]   They're no longer off on the side and in conspicuous there.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:42.480]   Sometimes all you see until you start to roll down the page.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.840]   That's what my point was.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:49.960]   Horrible pitch, sorry Lee, I just going to say it reached a horrible point this last
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.480]   year after the iPhone launch.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.560]   If you would have looked at the iPhone, if you search iPhone and you went to the page
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:04.320]   on Google after that, you would have seen that to Harry's point, almost two thirds of
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:10.920]   those units were one way or another different paid because it was the carriers, it was
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:15.160]   accessory makers, it was everybody and they had essentially you saw what Google looks
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:21.640]   like when every ad unit is bought and the experience for the user was really terrible.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:26.640]   Also Apple bought Apple had to buy ads on there essentially to get their stuff.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   Defensively.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   You know, front and center.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.640]   Right.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.640]   Defensively.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   Exactly.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   Defensively.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.040]   And so for, you know, in the past like CNET, you know, where I've worked for the last three
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.800]   years, you know, we've had a wonderful way to optimize and get the most useful information
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.200]   out to our readers through Google.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:51.040]   This year, it was very difficult, near impossible because almost all of that real estate, the
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.920]   usable real estate was purchased.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.920]   I guess that was my point all along was you start going down this road, it gets more and
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:04.760]   more predatory, it gets more and more unpleasant, people rebel more and now you have this contentious
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:09.160]   environment where people hate ads and they have to spy on you to do the ads and people
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.200]   hate that and it's just gone down a very bad road.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.720]   And I think Google made a mistake.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.120]   Maybe they didn't have any choice, but they made a mistake.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.800]   This was not the right way to go.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.280]   And I for one, no, I'm not going to say that.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:32.840]   I pledge to you that we will continue to do host red ads for down home products nobody
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   ever heard of.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.840]   So there.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:44.600]   There's a distinction that I'd like to toss into the discussion between the ads, the advertising
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:50.440]   that we're talking about where people are buying ad placement by Google on a web page
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.960]   and then the ads that platforms serve you, as Jason was saying, you know, that Facebook
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:02.400]   has all this data, that there is a distinctly different experience, or at least from my anecdotal
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.760]   use of platforms.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:11.160]   I am pretty ruthless about, you know, if they're going to serve me ads, I am going to block
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:16.760]   advertisers that I don't want to hear from and I'm going to use their tools to tell them,
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.040]   okay, that's not relevant, not relevant, not relevant.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:23.560]   And now I actually on both Twitter and Instagram, I don't use Facebook proper, but on Twitter
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.760]   and Instagram, I will say that my ad experience is not bad.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.840]   No, that's why I have to stop using Instagram because they're so damn good.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.080]   I always buy crap I don't want.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.080]   Right.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:39.640]   But sometimes I buy crap, you know, just like, you know, I'm writing down Twitter codes,
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.760]   sometimes I'm actually grateful for the ads that get served to me now.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.120]   Oh, now for the stuff I buy online, I buy because of Instagram ads.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.360]   It's really, it's a very effective platform.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:53.320]   It would be better if those ads were actually instead of, you know, being targeted to your
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:58.480]   interests and then you're rolling the dice on whether it's a piece of crap or not, whether
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.960]   there was some sort of vetting that went into your mind.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960]   I guess.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960]   Sometimes you luck out.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.280]   I bought the greatest thing off Instagram the other day and it's, you know, very targeted
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:16.440]   at me because I'm a skier and I see you with my phone and I am, you're constantly getting
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:23.120]   your phone out to take pictures or to, you know, I saw your work life, where your knees,
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.520]   your knees lost the battle.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.240]   My knees actually didn't lose.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.000]   Well, my knees lost to the fact that I wanted to go skiing, but yeah, they're kind of in
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   pain now.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   I was up in Canada skiing.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   It looked amazing.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.920]   That looked like a 18 year old.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.920]   Oh my gosh.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.400]   That was, that was some very nice.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.760]   But on that trip, I brought with me this thing that I bought on Instagram that attaches
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.960]   to your jacket and keeps your phone from falling out.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.480]   Oh, that's what I need.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.400]   It's the most brilliant thing.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:57.080]   And I would never have found it but for that Instagram ad and I was happy to have it.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.760]   So where were you?
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.240]   Canada, British Columbia.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.720]   Are you a whistler or?
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.680]   No way in the middle of nowhere outside of a, in the monies and the caribou are the mountain
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   ridges.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.720]   And did you bring your personal photographer with you or what?
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   No, that's no.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.520]   Wouldn't it be nice if that was like?
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.480]   It looks like you got like, oh yeah, I have a guy.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.520]   He does, he does all my stills.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520]   Yeah, no.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.520]   This is great.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.800]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:28.000]   We had such a nice time and my goal was just to make sure that I had three 18 year olds
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   with me who were, you know, they're far more aggressive skiers than I am.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   There they are.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.560]   And we met some really nice people from Oregon and just had the greatest time.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.000]   It was a fabulous trip.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.480]   Yeah, this morning I shaved with a razor blade.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:47.280]   I bought an Instagram, I'm wearing Instagram underwear right now.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.280]   That might be TMI.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.000]   By the way, if you, this is the, this is another example.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.400]   If you buy a razor on Instagram, you will then get razor blade ads from every other
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.560]   rate, because there's a hundred razor blade companies for some reason.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.720]   They're all trying to sell you now.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.600]   Well, if you like that, you'll love ours.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.600]   No, thank you.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.600]   I'm happy.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.080]   I got the way I got what I want.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.440]   I'm not against advertising.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.440]   I'm really not.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.720]   It's what supports us is what keeps us afloat.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.840]   We did offer club twits to the people who hate advertising don't have to listen.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.880]   And that's worked out quite well.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.960]   But not nearly to the degree that we could drop advertising.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.360]   And I want people who don't want to spend seven bucks a month to be able to hear our
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   shows.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.000]   I don't want to pay wall.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.320]   So, you know, I think it's worked out for us.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.880]   I don't, I worry about podcasting going forward in the water.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.720]   Hey, anyway, let's do an ad.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.600]   Can't wait to do that.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   You know what?
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.680]   Get your pen out Denise.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.400]   You may already know about this, but if you don't, you're going to want to get it.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.400]   It's called Blue Land.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   Do you know about Blue Land?
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.720]   So there's a thread in what Lisa and I do these days.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.320]   We're really trying to cut down waste, single use plastic.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.160]   We're trying to be kind of the earth.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.800]   Blue land is so cool.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.280]   So it's a couple of facts that we'll set this up.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:11.560]   Did you know that an estimated five billion plastic, hand soap and cleaning bottles are
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.240]   thrown away every year, five billion.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:21.800]   And by the way, every bottle, you know, that you buy in the store, that's 90% water.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.200]   So you're paying to ship water plus a little bit of active ingredient and all that plastic.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.680]   Then you throw out the plastic.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.680]   This does, this is not a tenable situation.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.960]   It's a lose, lose for you and for the planet.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.240]   That's why we started using Blue Land.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.840]   Blue Land's revolutionary refill cleaning system instead.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.800]   When you set up Blue Land, I've done it now for myself, but also my daughter, which you
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.000]   got a new apartment, I got a whole Blue Land thing.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.880]   They'll send you the squirt bottles, the hand soap bottles, the detergent by all the stuff,
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:01.200]   little tin cans you could put your soap in for your dishwasher and your clothes washer.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.760]   And then when you need more, they send you the powdered form of it.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.040]   You add the water.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.520]   You buy the bottle once, you refill it forever, no more plastic waste and no more shipping
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.080]   water.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.120]   And it's great stuff.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.280]   You just fill these beautiful Instagram, well, yes, bottles with warm water.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280]   You pop in.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.520]   So for the hands up, we love the hands up.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.520]   In fact, I just got a whole set of, in December, a Christmas smell.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.600]   There's a gingerbread, there's peppermint.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.320]   I love how you use this gingerbread.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.480]   So it smells like somebody's making gingerbread men.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.200]   You just, so you get it, you fill it with water to the line, you pop in the tablet,
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:47.240]   it dissolves and now it's hand soap, foaming hand soap or spray cleaner or bathroom cleaner.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.480]   Actually, you know what people love and they sold out a lot.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.480]   I think there's some right now.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.640]   So you should get it.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.920]   Blue Land's toilet tablet cleaner.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.440]   They sell out really fast.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.640]   You put one in the toilet, it fizzes, it cleans it, you brush it and you're done.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.920]   It's incredible.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:10.720]   The Sense Amazing Iris agave, Perrine Lemon, Lavender Eucalyptus.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:19.040]   I just want you to go to blueland.com/twit and check this out.
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.320]   I got my daughter, the clean essentials kit to get her all started.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.320]   There's a hand soap duo.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.400]   We actually have in every bathroom now.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.280]   We have Blue Land hand soap, different sense.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.440]   It's wonderful.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.880]   Plastic free laundry and dishwasher tablets that are great.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.880]   They work.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.960]   That's the other thing I think maybe you thought, oh, you've tried other recyclable or earth-friendly
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.960]   products.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.960]   They don't work.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.960]   These work great.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.080]   These are just like the commercial products you'd buy, but without all the waste.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:49.720]   And without all the cost, Blue Land's stunning high quality forever bottles started just $10
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   when you buy a kit.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.360]   They will be reused forever.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:58.160]   The refill tablets, which is what you're going to continue to buy, two bucks.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.280]   So you save a huge amount of money.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:04.240]   You save the planet by not using all this plastic waste.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.240]   I use it.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.040]   The dish soap is great.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.040]   Blue Land, try it.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.040]   You will love it.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.800]   The planet will thank you.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.120]   I had heard about this for years.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.120]   We finally got it.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.120]   And now I'm thrilled.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.720]   It's way past time to make cleaning fun, beautiful, and plastic free.

[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:37.200]   I gave Abby the whole set and she loves it.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200]   Everything smells great.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.360]   It's easy to clean.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.800]   And you don't waste those bottles.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.640]   Blueland.com/twit.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.640]   Don't forget to-
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.280]   Yeah, I can't come on this show anymore.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.280]   It's like it's been-
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.280]   You're-
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.280]   No, no, no.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.680]   I mean, this is not expensive.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.440]   You will thank me because this is the future.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.480]   I'm telling you, this is-
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.480]   Nice.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.480]   No more guilt over-
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.880]   We used to go through plastic bottles of dish soap.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.600]   You know, every week they'll be a new one.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   Not anymore.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.600]   Not anymore.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   It's great.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   Nice.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:16.160]   Um, Nvidia is going to abandon their $40 million, $40 billion.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.000]   Let's get the number right dollar arm bid.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.480]   I don't know if I'm sad or happy.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.080]   Arm is currently owned by SoftBank.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.040]   Uh, I feel like Nvidia might have been a good partner.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.960]   On the other hand, there were a lot of people worried that Nvidia might, you know, kind
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:35.360]   of take over arm and make it hard for others to license arm stuff.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.240]   I doubt that would have happened, but I understand.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:42.960]   Anyway, regulators are going to put the kibosh on that, both here and in Europe.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.960]   SoftBank at this point says, "We don't want it.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.240]   We're getting rid of it.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.760]   We're going to do an IPO.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.760]   We're going to-
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   We're going to get out of it."
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.280]   Uh, Jason, any opinion?
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.120]   You know, I don't think that this changes much.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.200]   I think that Nvidia still has a great future.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:08.240]   They are going to be at the heart of what is this massive wave of artificial intelligence
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:14.440]   and machine learning that really over the next decade is going to revolutionize so many
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   things.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.880]   Um, they're, they're going to do just fine without this.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.440]   Um, arm is also, they're going to be great.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:27.920]   Like they have a great future as well, doing what they do, designing chips.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.000]   Um, their chips are taking over the world.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.600]   Um, and you know, the wild thing is with what Intel's doing, um, becoming a chip maker
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.080]   for other, uh, for other people, it's very possible that Intel is going to probably be
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:49.040]   making arm chips, right, uh, manufacturing arm design, uh, you know, designs that are,
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.680]   uh, that are from arm for other, for other companies.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.880]   And so it's a future that I, I could see them as an independent company still doing
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.480]   really well and they have a great future.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:07.360]   I think probably both companies, I think arm has a better future potentially independently,
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:12.000]   um, because the future, you know, they have so much runway to their,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.480]   their chips are going to be in everything, uh, over the next decade, more things.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.480]   And under arm, it was going to be a little bit limited to, or sorry, under Nvidia, um,
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.080]   arm would have been a little bit, uh, a little bit limited, but I don't think it really changes
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   months.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.080]   Both these companies have a great future.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.960]   Yeah, I'm very bullish on Nvidia.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.920]   Here's a good way to win a bar bet.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:37.320]   Ask somebody which is bigger in v, which is a bigger chip maker, Nvidia or Intel.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:45.680]   Uh, everybody'll go with Intel, Intel's worth $211 billion in, Nvidia's worth $582 billion.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.160]   Second only to TSMC, which is easily the biggest chip maker by market cap.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.520]   Intel's not that big.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.840]   It's smaller than Broadcom, smaller than Samsung.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.520]   They missed the whole mobile wave.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   They blew it.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.880]   Look at all four of these, the bigger ones are all mobile chips.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.800]   It was funny, I found some notes from an old Intel used to always have in San Francisco
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.040]   and Moscone West.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:14.400]   They used to always have this event Intel IDF, um, the Intel developer forum.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:20.520]   And I found these old notes from 2007 where Intel had all these charts about the next
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.320]   great wave is in mobile.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:27.480]   And we're changing the whole company to take advantage of where all of this is going.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.560]   And we're going to be ready for it.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.560]   And here's our roadmap.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.640]   I mean, they, they knew it was coming and, and they just couldn't execute against it.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:41.160]   They just weren't, you know, their, their mindset wasn't quite what it needed to be to,
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.480]   to take advantage of it.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.480]   And boy, did it hurt.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:51.200]   Ben Thompson has done a great series on his trajectory, website and newsletter about Intel.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:54.960]   And I think his take is pretty astute.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:01.560]   All along, he said Intel's mistake was doubling down on the ID event, integrated company where
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.920]   they both designed and manufactured chips.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:09.960]   And they got beat by the companies that even did one or the other, that by Nvidia or ARM,
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:14.080]   which were designed firms or TSMC, which is a build firm.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:21.480]   And both TSMS, TSMC, Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and, and video have gotten bigger
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.600]   than Intel by picking one.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:31.000]   And Intel, because their fabs couldn't keep up with their designs was held back and really
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.920]   didn't make competitive designs and did, as you say, they missed out entirely on mobile.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.680]   Their scale architecture was a flop.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:46.000]   And so what is interesting is that Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO of Intel, who is a chip designer,
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.520]   he was instrumental in the 486.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.000]   Harry, you remember that?
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   I do.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.920]   That's Pat, Pat basically designed that chip.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.760]   He was the lead architect on that.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.960]   And so now he's running the company and he's done something I think that will, that is
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.960]   a big gamble.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.800]   But I think at this point, maybe that's what you need to do.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:10.520]   He's decided to in effect do both, but not integrated to build fabs.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.720]   They build big fabs in, whether building a big one in Arizona, I think.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.520]   They just stand in Ohio.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.920]   They just did a deal in Ohio.
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.360]   That's right.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.920]   And then also, $20 billion.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.040]   Yeah, $20 bill.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.960]   But also then to double down on the design business.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.280]   Harry, is this a good strategy, Zing?
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.960]   I think it seems like he's doing smart things with the cards that were dealt him when he
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.840]   signed up as CEO, along with being willing to make chips based on other architectures.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.120]   They're also opening up the x86 architecture.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:50.960]   So instead of a chip that Intel, based on Intel technology, being what Intel thinks
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.840]   it should be, someone else could build on top of Intel's designs and tweak it, which
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.240]   is a lot closer to what ARM has always done, where other companies license the rights to
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.960]   ARM's cores and build on top of them.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.760]   It sounds, I mean, this is, assuming this Nvidia ARM deal doesn't happen, it's really
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.520]   good news for Intel.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:19.440]   It sounds like in general, the tech industry would just as much be relieved if the deal
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.360]   doesn't happen.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.160]   I think it's probably overall.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.080]   Nvidia will be fine.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.240]   I think Nvidia is such a smart company.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.520]   There's a decent chance they would have not have screwed up ARM.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.200]   But I think there has been value to the fact that ARM has always essentially been Switzerland,
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.840]   this third party that designs stuff that any technology company can license and use.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:47.320]   And that would have fundamentally changed if Nvidia, which has always been an ARM customer
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.120]   up until now for its designs, had also owned ARM.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.400]   I'd say on balance, I'm glad if it doesn't happen, although it might have been OK if
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   it had.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.960]   Of course, at this point, the best known ARM licensee is Apple with its M1 architecture.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:08.260]   And I have to think Intel is somewhat stung by the performance and the power curve of
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.760]   Apple's M1s, especially since they keep saying, "Oh, we got chips that are faster."
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.760]   You've seen them.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.760]   They want them back.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   Sorry, good.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.040]   Yeah, they want to make them.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.240]   They want to make chips in the fabs for Apple.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.640]   But you know, right now, same stuff in TMS.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.440]   TSM's doing a three nanometer process.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.280]   Good luck Intel.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.880]   There's been this really healthy competition among all these companies at license arms
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.880]   designs.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:37.920]   And you have Apple taking some of the same IP and running away from Qualcomm, which ultimately
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.200]   is a good thing for Qualcomm because they have a key to it.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.720]   It's good for us all.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.720]   That's right.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.720]   That's right.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.200]   And they're building things they might not have been able to otherwise.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.200]   Sorry, go ahead Denise.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.160]   Oh, no, you finished.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.160]   I'd say that all these companies are doing things they might not have been able to if
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.880]   they were 100% responsible for designing processors from scratch.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.200]   So it's worked out really surprisingly well.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:05.080]   And Arm always had this vision back to when they were founded decades ago.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:08.280]   And it really came into its own just in this century.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.720]   Go ahead Denise.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.480]   I had a couple of just government related observations on this story.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.520]   For one, it's just another sign that antitrust is on regulators' minds.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.960]   The FTC sued to stop this merger.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.880]   China wants to stop it too.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.440]   And I'm sure if you regulators had any say in the matter, they would want to stop it
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.440]   too.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.440]   It just seems like there's a lot of...
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.440]   Well, he did because arm's a British company.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:40.640]   And I know the Brits were not happy about Arm being bought by Nvidia.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.680]   So there's just, you know, antitrust is a bigger force in the world than it has been
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680]   in the last several years.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680]   Is that cool?
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   Do you think?
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.680]   I...
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.680]   Yes.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.160]   Qualified, yes.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:02.000]   Like I do feel like the flood of antitrust proposed legislation that came out earlier
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.400]   this year, some was good, some was bad, some was ugly.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:14.600]   So I do think that we have to be aware of antitrust overreach, but at the same time,
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.440]   there's a reason why it's much more on lawmakers' minds.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.760]   So I think this is just, you know, another symptom of that.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.720]   The other government observation I would make is, you know, I'm not worried about arm
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:33.320]   or Nvidia if this doesn't go through as both Harry and Jason have said.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.000]   Arm is poised.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.520]   I'm not quite sure how well this is shaking out, but it seems like as a chip manufacturer,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:45.840]   they're going to get a shot in the arm from the government if they haven't already to
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:51.360]   bring some chip production to the more chip production to the U.S. and deal with the supply
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.960]   chain issues that we're having.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.120]   So I think they're probably excited about that.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:05.160]   And then on the personal front, one of my good family friends in the smartest AI guy
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:13.040]   I know is the worldwide AI initiatives VP at Nvidia and the chair of their AI compute
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   task force.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.640]   And he's writing his names, Keith Stryer.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.640]   And you know, he's going to take them to good places.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:27.480]   When we watched, we streamed the Nvidia's most recent keynote.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:32.600]   I was just blown away, you know, because of the Samable Salmon in our car segments, I'm
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.960]   very aware of what NVIDIA is doing in automotive.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:42.480]   It's obvious they're killing it in gaming, in crypto mining.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.720]   They're just firing on all cylinders.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.000]   They have, they are in the AI.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   They're huge.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.480]   In fact, this new meta supercomputer they just built is built with Nvidia and Nvidia
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.080]   chips.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.040]   They are firing on all cylinders.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.600]   I think they're a really interesting company.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.320]   And so I guess, yeah, for that reason, I don't, they don't need arm.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.440]   And arm will, if it does an IPO, which I think is likely arm will then be a standalone company
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.040]   as it should be.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.600]   And I think that's probably the best for everybody all around.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.160]   But this competition is really good.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.640]   I love seeing a strong Nvidia.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.640]   You know what?
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:20.200]   We didn't haven't mentioned and all this is AMD, which has been making them great.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.200]   Yeah, they've been making a run for it.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.200]   Yep.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.200]   They're doing great.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.640]   And, you know, Intel as well, if we circle back to Intel, we all, we all are going to
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.440]   be better from a renewed Intel.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.440]   Absolutely.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.640]   And that gelsinger is a chip maker's, you know, chip maker.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   He knows the industry.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.280]   He's an excellent leader and CEO includes lots of people, knows how to put the right
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.320]   people in the right positions.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.800]   He'll do great in Intel, but the best thing that he has going from the one thing you can
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.960]   never control in business is timing.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.600]   And he has timing on his side right now because one thing that we've learned over the last
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:06.360]   two years, the last 24 months especially, is that having all of the chip making in East
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:13.720]   Asia and having all of those things shipped out there is not a good thing.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:20.840]   And so the world is going to kind of want to put that chip making in lots more places
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:27.360]   and closer to where the product design development, final manufacturing is.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.040]   And that is going to benefit a lot of people, but it's definitely going to benefit in sale,
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:40.360]   especially if the chips act passed in the US where then building chips in the US becomes
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.720]   as advantageous in terms of taxes and business investment.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.480]   As it is in Asia, then you're not going to only see Intel building here.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:53.480]   You're going to see as TSMC is already there, they're planning a plant here.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.120]   Samsung is planning a plant in Texas.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:01.840]   You're going to see this movement to decentralize the making of these chips.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:09.400]   Intel has a great, they have a level playing field potentially and some opportunities
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:15.440]   to really go into this in a way where they can design where they're behind on, as we
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.600]   know from the nanometer side of things perspective.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.880]   But also in terms of chip making, they can start building, they know how to build and
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.240]   manufacture things.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.320]   And so that's going to be an opportunity for them to really, yeah.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.360]   I worry a little bit because of course everybody talks when they talk about chip shortage
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.360]   about Intel, AMD, Nvidia.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.120]   The real chip shortage is not those chips.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:44.760]   It's all these little legacy cheapo chips that are almost commodities.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.560]   But if you can't, if who was it?
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.440]   General Motors had to sell a bunch of cars without seat warmers because the chip that
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.560]   controls the seat warmers is unavailable.
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.760]   If you can't sell cars because that's missing, that's just as big a deal.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:05.080]   And I doubt very much people are investing $30 billion to build the chips for seat warmers.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:09.040]   I don't know where, I don't know who's doing that, but let's bring that home too.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.120]   That could be the $10 million.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.880]   Let's bring that home too.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.880]   It's true.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:20.640]   But AI and machine learning, you know, AI, the cost of AI is decreasing rapidly right
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.640]   now.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:29.400]   So because of that, over the next decade, the need for these more powerful chips is going
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.040]   to skyrocket, right?
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.040]   Well, see that?
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.080]   I like this meta computer and Nvidia and Intel.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.280]   That response to my concern, which is we're building all these fabs, are we going to have
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:44.680]   a glut in three years when they all come online and suddenly everybody's making chips.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:49.720]   But you think demand will will will increase to match the increase in productivity?
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:55.760]   Yes, because of the how rapidly the developments in AI and machine learning.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.960]   Well, that's what's happened.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.760]   That's one of the reasons there's a shortage is demand has increased remarkably.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:05.360]   And every year we're just at the start of the age where almost everything is a computer,
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.840]   which means almost everything will have chips in it.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:12.520]   And it seems pretty likely that that will continue to ramp up at least as quickly as
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.440]   these new fabs come out.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.440]   Not always a good thing.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.240]   No, not at all.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:26.160]   Lisa bought a mini Cooper electric mini Cooper about a month ago, 854 miles in.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.640]   It just stopped working.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:34.280]   And I mean, literally, it just said, no, you know, everything's broken.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:40.520]   Brakes don't work, lights don't work, drive, train malfunction, every like all like a Christmas
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.040]   tree.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:46.320]   And we had it towed down to where we bought it in Marin.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.800]   They said, Oh, we don't know what they had.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:54.280]   And they had it towed to BMW for some, I guess BMW makes the drive train in San Francisco.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.440]   They finally looked at it.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:02.000]   They said, well, it's going to take us at least three weeks to get the board replaced.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.880]   This car is a car.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:04.880]   It's got four wheels.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:12.560]   It's got all the stuff it needs, except that the chip in it is malfunctioned and is undriable.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:16.280]   So Lisa, needless to say, is not too happy.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.760]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:22.080]   Apple decided to go into the chip business and seems to be it's been a very good move.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.080]   Like being there.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.560]   Yeah, very good move.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.560]   They're making great stuff.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:31.400]   In fact, one of the stories from this week is how PC sales have gone through the roof.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.280]   And the biggest growth area was Mac.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:38.960]   I still only 8% of the market, but still big growth for Apple computers.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.080]   And I have to think some of that is people going on.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.240]   I like these new chips.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.120]   Those smart higher Johnny Saruji to run their chip making business.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.240]   And that was what an incredible move.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.960]   And obviously a team, you know, he doesn't design and make all the chips himself.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.440]   So but he also knew the right people to hire.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.360]   And they have just taken off like a rocket since they did that and put him in charge.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:07.400]   Although they did just lose one of the guys who designed the M1 chip went back to Intel.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:13.600]   They'd hired him away from Intel, Jeff Willcox is going back to Intel to design systems
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600]   on a chip.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:20.080]   So it's quite a revolving door in that business, I think.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.080]   Let's take a little break.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:24.320]   Actually, this was the week Apple had its quarterly results.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.320]   Microsoft too.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:29.360]   We could talk a little bit about I don't think financial results have that much to do with
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.480]   technology as they do, at least not as much as they do with the market, but still there's
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.000]   you get some insights into how these companies are doing and what they're doing from their
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   financial reports.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.760]   I show today brought to you by Audible.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.720]   And here's another one where it's an easy recommend.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.160]   I have literally been an Audible member 22 years.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.160]   It all started for me when I was commuting to San Francisco at a two to four hour commute
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]   every day.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.080]   I was going crazy, discovered audiobooks from Audible and my life was changed.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:02.920]   I've listened to so I have more than 500 audiobooks I've listened to on Audible.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.080]   I just love them.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.880]   Apple app makes it easy to listen anytime, anywhere you'll discover exclusive Audible
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.160]   originals from big name celebrities.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:17.600]   Steve Martin reading Born Standing Up was just awesome.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.200]   Keith Richards reading his biography.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:24.680]   Actually, they have Johnny Depp reading it for the first three quarters as if he's Keith
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.680]   Richards.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.560]   And then three quarters the way through the biography.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.280]   He suddenly says, and now ladies and gentlemen, Keith Richards.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.040]   Keith reads the last quarter of it, which I loved.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.120]   You can listen to Audible while you're traveling commuting like me while you're working out,
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.320]   washing the dishes, walking the dog.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.640]   By the way, Audible also includes thousands of podcasts, some of the most popular favorites,
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.200]   exclusive new series.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.040]   And as a member at Audible, you get full access to a growing selection of included audiobooks.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.960]   Just part of your subscription, you can download or stream all you want.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:02.800]   I was watching that new HBO show, The Gilded Age.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.040]   And it's okay, but it made me crave some Edith Wharton.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:10.800]   You know, I wanted the real deal, the author of The Age of Innocence.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.840]   So I thought, I'm going to get the House of Mirth.
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:18.840]   And I looked at Audible had, I am not kidding, a dozen different versions of the House of
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.640]   Mirth, but it turned out the best one I got for free is because it's an Audible Plus title.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:28.160]   I'm glad I checked.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:30.040]   So that is a really nice thing.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.920]   I cannot wait to listen to the House of Mirth.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.600]   They've got a great actress reading that.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.560]   You get a full selection of audiobooks as a member.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.640]   Audible gives members a chance to listen to and discover new favorites and explore different
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.840]   formats.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.640]   And that's one of the things that makes your membership so much more valuable.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:52.320]   For instance, if you are like me, a fan of music, the words plus music series is fantastic.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.280]   How albums were made, what happened, you know, the story behind the album or maybe a podcast
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.040]   you never heard of or considered before.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.040]   They even have theatrical performances.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.560]   I love those.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:08.680]   Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, part two just came out fully dramatized.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:11.360]   It's the best radio theater you've ever heard.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.920]   It's incredible.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.520]   And as an Audible member, you could choose one title a month to keep from their entire
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.520]   catalog.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.360]   That's how I got 500 in my library.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.000]   And they're in your library forever, by the way.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.480]   I often go back and listen.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.360]   When the movie Dune came out, I said, I want to listen to Dune again.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.360]   It was great.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.680]   I want to dramatize, as a matter of fact.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:32.280]   Bestsellers, new releases, classics, Audible loves science fiction.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.280]   I know you, we all love science fiction.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:39.080]   Audible is a great place for sci-fi because so much of the early sci-fi, things like Foundation
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.080]   and Dune weren't recorded originally.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:47.560]   Audible actually set up studios to create the Audible Frontiers series, which is finally
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.200]   audiobook versions of some of the most iconic science fiction novels.
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.400]   So that's really a great reason to join Audible.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.560]   All available to download or stream.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.960]   You can listen anywhere, anytime on any device.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.960]   And you know what?
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:01.960]   You never lose your spot.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.640]   Always pick up right where you left off.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.640]   So I'll get home.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:05.640]   I'll sit down in my office.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.640]   I'll say, Hey, Echo, read to me.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.400]   It'll pick up right where I left off in the car.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.400]   I love it.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:15.840]   2022 is all about celebrating our newfound self-awareness and making positive change,
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:16.840]   right?
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.360]   Audible helps make space for what matters to you.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:24.280]   It's a destination for your wellness, whether you're looking to soul search, be inspired,
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.640]   look towards new goals, unwind, or simply be entertained.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:32.800]   We've had some time to find out what truly makes us happy and Audible.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.000]   Let's just have more of it.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.640]   Recently, we've been listening to audiobook called Being Mortal, which is kind of heavy,
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.480]   but it's about end of life and how we think about it.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.480]   And it's just a wonderful, wonderful listen.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.120]   You're always going to find the best of what you love or something new to discover.

[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.280]   There's a good example of an advertiser that's been with us from I think more than a decade.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.840]   I was going to say, we weren't they one of your first?
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.960]   Because I heard about it on Twit, on Audible.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.720]   You can blame me for that as well, sure.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.720]   Go ahead.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.720]   I know, thanks.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.880]   You cost me thousands of dollars.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:39.400]   But it's, it's, I want to say 2004, 2005, I heard it on Twit and I remember getting
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.120]   it when I first got it, I had to like download it to my computer and then sync it to my
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.120]   iPod.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.120]   That's right.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.920]   And then listen to it with my iPod.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:54.760]   I was very glad that I did and have been, yeah, have been a member, you know, for now, I mean,
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:57.040]   almost 20 years because of Twit, which is pretty much.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.560]   My only problem is I have so many audio books.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.320]   I don't have as much time as I used to because I don't have that four hour community anymore.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.760]   I wish I could listen more often.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.960]   But what I've discovered is there's the house of Mirth.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.960]   I'm now starting the Expanse series.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.440]   They've got all of them.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:13.080]   Really nice production of that.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.360]   Lots of great stuff.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:19.320]   One of the things I've done is, is I've started listening when I'm playing video games because
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.640]   I always feel guilty that I'm playing a game and not doing anything important.
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:29.200]   And so I figure, well, at least I'm reading and playing a video game.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.040]   So that's, that's how I feel better about myself.
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:35.200]   Last one, Lisa and I listened to together was Hawaii.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.880]   Boy, is that a long novel?
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.160]   I think that was, what is it?
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.160]   40 hours.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:44.400]   Missioner, 51 hours and 56 minutes.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.600]   Make it 52 hours.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.120]   Yeah, that's a lot of Hawaii.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:52.520]   Anyway, Audible, we love them.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.720]   We love you Audible.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:56.120]   Thank you for being with us all these years.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:58.640]   Audible.com/twitter.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.560]   Go text Twit to 500 500.
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.240]   It's important by the way, talking about this podcast thing.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:10.080]   If you use those codes or you use that address, please, it's really important because that's
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:13.120]   how Audible measures their effectiveness.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:18.800]   We want them to know that you all listen and subscribe because of us.
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.880]   Thank you.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:24.160]   It's almost a cliche.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:29.600]   Apple had the best quarter it's ever had again.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:37.760]   Overall revenue up 11% earnings per share up 25% year over year.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.600]   iPhone revenue up 9% year over year.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:41.600]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.600]   You could sell more iPhones.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:47.680]   But I guess they found somebody who hasn't bought one yet.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.320]   Big victory on services.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:52.000]   May remember when Apple said, "We're going to be a services company.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.800]   We're not going to give you numbers of sales anymore.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:58.400]   We're going to talk about revenue per user and the best way to up revenue per users to
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.920]   sell them stuff, services after the sale.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:05.560]   19.52 billion.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.040]   It's 24% up year over year.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.680]   Mac revenue up 25%.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.520]   iPad revenue up 14%.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.520]   Gross margin.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:24.720]   This is the number I always makes me go, "Oh my God, 43.8%.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.480]   That's a lot of margin."
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:30.120]   What does that mean exactly?
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.120]   Profit margin.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.120]   Profit.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.120]   That's their profit.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   Wow.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.840]   Most of these companies are trying to get buy with 5% to 10%.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:41.840]   Oh my God.
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:49.960]   But not only does the revenue through the roof, $123 billion, but you get to keep 43%
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:50.960]   of that.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.960]   That's insane.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:58.080]   Nobody knows how to sandbag expectations like Apple.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.280]   That's why you said Leo.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:08.160]   It's like, again, they exceed expectations.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:14.840]   Somehow, they always find a way to hold expectations in line.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:20.680]   That said, no one, I remember a bunch of the analysts saying, "Who, they always take this
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.680]   and do account."
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.680]   Right?
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.680]   They're like, "There's the Apple number and then there's the number."
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:25.680]   We've been sandbags.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.680]   We know they're going to do better than what they told us.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.680]   Okay.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:28.680]   Fine.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:34.040]   So now, 123, everybody was just like, "Where did this come from?"
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.120]   That's for three months.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.680]   That's more than $40 billion a month.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:46.020]   This was despite the supply chain issues and the fact that a lot of the hardware you
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:50.080]   couldn't really get, and there was long lead times to get things like an iPhone.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:56.200]   They might have done if they could have fulfilled every iPhone order immediately.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:00.600]   So forgive me, because I don't want to be the cheese in your gruel or the...
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.600]   I don't know what the phrase is.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.480]   Can we make that the show?
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.480]   No.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.240]   They aren't exactly...
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:20.560]   I mean, are they that much better than everybody else, the greatest company of all $3 trillion?
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:25.200]   Are they that much better or are they that much better at marketing, I guess?
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.440]   Actually, you touched on it in the beginning, I think, Leo.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.000]   So look at the US and China.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.400]   They're two biggest and most important markets, and the iPhone being their most important
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.800]   phone.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:40.880]   In China, for the first time in six years, they shot to number one again, the number
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.760]   one phone, which nobody expected them to...
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.760]   No.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.760]   Retate.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:50.920]   Remember that Huawei suddenly shot to the top last year or the year before when we blocked
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:55.800]   them, when we banned them, when we forbid US companies for dealing with Huawei, out of...
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:00.360]   It was assumed patriotism, the Chinese people said, "We're buying Huawei.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.000]   That didn't last that long."
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000]   It didn't.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.760]   And then in the US, they're up to...
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:10.200]   I want to say it's 47 or 49% of the US.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:13.480]   They are growing margin, smartphone margin.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.040]   In the US, they're growing it in China.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.320]   They're two biggest markets.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.800]   So why is that?
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:22.280]   Because just to your point, are they making a device that's that much better?
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.360]   I think we all think the answer is no.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.800]   The devices are good.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:30.320]   They're excellent, but Samsung's excellent.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.400]   One plus is excellent.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:35.040]   A lot of these are making really good devices.
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:43.520]   What appears to be the factor that's driving them forward is this integration both with
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.200]   services and the other devices.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:52.120]   As people are buying more Apple devices, you mentioned the Mac is up.
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:57.680]   The iPad and the iPad was the one that got hit by the most by the supply chain.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:02.640]   Tim called it out, but iPads have had a big resurgence during the pandemic.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.920]   More people at home and people on different screens not wanting to watch the same things
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.680]   or do all kinds of other things.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:14.880]   And then the services that people have really responded, especially to Apple One and the
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.640]   bundle, not just their bundle, but a lot of other bundles too.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:25.080]   So services and the other devices seem to be what's carrying Apple and giving them a
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:28.560]   leg up because it's not just the hardware itself.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.120]   If not the whole ecosystem.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.320]   Well, it's the ecosystem in a kind of under duress.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:42.960]   So for instance, Apple just released a beta of Mac OS 11 Monterey that features this new
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.960]   universal control.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:52.600]   And of course, what is universal control required that you own a lot of Apple stuff?
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:59.000]   You can now move your mouse and your keyboard from Mac to an iPad and back and forth.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.460]   So it's got a multi-screen experience.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:01.880]   It's not even a new idea.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:05.280]   There've been products that do this for a long time.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.920]   But Apple now has built it into the operating system.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:13.720]   Or if you have an iPhone and you don't want to use Face ID because you're wearing a mask,
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:21.280]   well, it so happens if you have an Apple watch, it'll unlock your iPhone.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.480]   They're very good at the ecosystem play.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.480]   I don't think that.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.480]   They're very good too.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.960]   And this goes back to Steve Jobs.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.080]   And we've all been around a long time and remember, you know, the early days and how
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:42.920]   important it was to his company to deliver the killer absolutely insanely great user
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:43.920]   experience.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:50.320]   And I feel like the company has really kept that as a value.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:54.400]   Because when you, I'll just use my own personal experience.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.200]   I had an iMac that lasted me 12 years that I just replaced.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.200]   >> It's quality.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.200]   >> It's quality.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.440]   >> It lasted 12 years.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.800]   My new one, I couldn't be more thrilled with it.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.480]   It is just a beautiful, fast spring.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.800]   >> And Harry, you just reviewed the Dell XPS and I think they're very nice.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.520]   But they don't have that same feel of quality.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:17.600]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.360]   >> The XPS I have to say is pretty hard.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.360]   Nice.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.360]   >> It's very nice.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.000]   >> But Dell is a computer company.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.160]   They don't make phones.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.040]   They have way less control over the software.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.560]   They're not going to fill your entire life with all kinds of Dell products.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:35.280]   They're dependent on Microsoft for their operating system.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.840]   >> And there is just something about, and by the way, part of the reason Dell's XPS
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:43.120]   is so nice is because they're copying Apple in a number of ways.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.560]   There's something about a MacBook.
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.400]   You're exactly right, Denise.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.480]   It feels like a quality product.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.560]   >> And on the services end, they don't drop the ball at all.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:57.880]   In fact, they deliver in ways other companies need to look at and take notes.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:04.160]   >> No, first of all, to me, of course, and I think to a lot of people, the fact that
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:10.440]   they've taken a good stand on privacy and data is important.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.160]   And it matters to people even in the background as they're using their devices.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.400]   >> Yeah, no, I think it is important, I agree.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.400]   >> Secondly, though, just as far as your day-to-day use of the device, someone three
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.520]   weeks after I bought my new iMac, someone knocked it over.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.360]   They're kind of, they're not super solid, right?
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.040]   >> No, they're basically iPads on a stick, but go ahead.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.640]   >> Right, they're iPads on a stick.
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:37.160]   So someone knocked over my three week old iPad on a stick and broke the screen just like
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.520]   you would break the screen on your phone.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:45.280]   But it works to replace it just like it would work to replace the screen on your phone.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:51.520]   I have AppleCare, it costs $99 and I have a new screen and I'm back in business.
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.400]   And it took a week.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.520]   So that was just another just incredible experience.
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:04.280]   And the other really great way I think they responded under fire was during the pandemic
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.120]   when they had to shut down all their stores.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:15.680]   They managed to just up their phone service and ability to respond by phone and mail in
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.920]   a way that was just amazing.
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:19.920]   Need to buy a new phone?
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:20.920]   Great.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.640]   Don't go into the store, call them up.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.760]   We'll deliver it right to you.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:28.640]   Problem with your existing phone, no worries, we'll ship you a box, ship it back to us, we'll
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:31.680]   fix it or replace it, you're good to go.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.680]   That lots of companies need to be taking them to the office.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.840]   >> You're sounding like a sheeple, I have to say.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:43.120]   >> I've been there, I've been there with other companies too.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.440]   And Ben, you roll your eyes and you go, okay, it's just poor customer service, we just have
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:48.920]   to get used to that.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.080]   And I've never had that with Apple.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:41:00.360]   >> And you're saying things like Apple is doing universal control and Microsoft and Google
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:05.560]   are working together to integrate Windows with Android, which is actually pretty cool
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:09.200]   if you have a Windows laptop and an Android phone, but they're never going to be able
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:13.880]   to make anything as seamless as what Apple can do because they are two separate operating
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:16.080]   systems controlled by different companies.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:20.240]   >> Apple really got the in-paste feature.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.640]   I was just going to say, it really blows my mind how you can just copy something on your
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:31.920]   computer or your iPad and send it to your phone.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.440]   >> When I want to embed it, it's so good.
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.440]   >> It's so good.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.600]   >> It's attachment on my Mac in email, it says you want to take a picture with your phone,
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.600]   we'll just put it in.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:46.920]   And it's like, that's hard for Dell to do, that's hard for anybody else to do.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.560]   Dell put a touch bar on that XPS though, right?
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.560]   >> They did.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:55.720]   >> Kind of, kind of sort of, I mean, the buttons don't jump around, they're fixed in one place.
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.560]   >> It's like Dell is two years behind Apple.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.800]   Apple has finally said, "Oh, God, get scared of that touch bar."
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.200]   Until it doesn't got the memo yet.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.280]   >> Well, and I'll fair enough, so I think it has really, really different--
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:08.280]   >> Oh, good.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.280]   >> What Apple did.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:13.120]   I mean, it's way less ambitious, whether it's better or not.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.620]   I'm not sure.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:18.700]   They also, when I talked to them, they talked about the fact that doing that also helped
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:25.460]   them make the system cooler, the internals cooler, removing that row of buttons.
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:27.020]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:30.380]   >> They've also done some things that Apple, for better or worse, they're doing things
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:36.220]   that Apple hasn't done, like the trackpad on the new XPS.
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:38.260]   There's no border around it at all.
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:43.700]   It's just the middle section of the rest area, so it is quite different.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:49.140]   And also, Dell kind of came up with the idea several years ago with the XPS of shrinking
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:52.100]   the borders of the screen down as much as possible.
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:55.780]   And Apple only got around to doing that last year, and that might be a case where Dell
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:58.860]   actually influenced Apple rather than the other way around.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:01.700]   >> Yeah, Dell's taken a while to get rid of the bezel.
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:05.020]   Apple, rather, has taken a while to do the bezel.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.020]   >> Yeah.
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.860]   >> And they added a notch along the way.
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:08.860]   >> Yeah.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:11.300]   The notch, you don't notice it.
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:13.380]   But right, Denise, do you have a laptop?
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:14.380]   I don't know if you do.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:15.380]   You have an iPad.
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.260]   >> I have an older MacBook Air.
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.860]   No, I don't think I have a notch.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:21.860]   >> Yeah.
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:28.020]   >> I do wonder if we shouldn't, and I think Denise mentioned this, we shouldn't underestimate
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:33.220]   the privacy and security part either, because it is getting worse and more challenging and
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:36.820]   more difficult, especially on privacy.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:42.580]   And Apple, this was somewhat, again, this is timing and maybe a little bit of luck.
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:45.460]   But Apple wanted to get into advertising.
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:50.340]   They wanted to do that, and they tried it, and they realized pretty quickly, we're just
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:52.140]   terrible at this.
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:55.020]   This is not a strength, and we don't want to invest to do it.
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:44:00.140]   So instead, let's go in the opposite direction and say, we're going to be the company that's
[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:04.340]   not going to take your data and use it and try to advertise against you.
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:08.780]   We're going to be the ones that say, we're going to push it back against all of that,
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:16.540]   and we're going to make that a feature of our product and try to turn a weakness into
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:17.540]   a strength.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:18.540]   >> How much of that's genuine?
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.540]   How much of it's marketing?
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:25.380]   >> Well, they do have a big deal with Google, which Apple benefits hugely from, and lets
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:28.860]   Google get at Apple users and monetize what they're doing online.
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:30.260]   >> Hey, Google, what is it?
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.260]   11 billion?
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.260]   >> For sure.
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:37.980]   >> No, Google pays them 11 billion or something to be the default search engine on Safari.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:44.940]   >> They don't, but they also, it's Safari shutting, and Apple shutting down a lot of
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:50.220]   this data stuff that's moved, that's this stuff forward more quickly.
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:56.620]   Because once it breaks on Apple devices, then a bunch of companies, lots of companies, and
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:02.500]   with how more and more of the web is mobile, they knew that the gig was up, and that was
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:03.900]   critical.
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:10.460]   And then with the things like they're doing with video doorbells and other video cameras
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:20.580]   where the stuff is not sent to the cloud or is used in these secure enclave-like kind
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:26.820]   of ways, is also another thing that is an example of them.
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:34.460]   They wouldn't do this if they weren't focused on this idea that we're going to turn security
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.620]   and privacy into a feature.
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:40.700]   Now, there's certainly some marketing in it as you're pointing out, Leo.
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:46.100]   I don't think they're, you know, they're not hiring a lot of PhDs in cryptography to try
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:50.020]   to make sure that all of their stuff is perfect.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:54.460]   But they aren't doing the opposite of like signing deals with Facebook and everybody else
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:56.580]   and trying to sell their users' data.
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:59.140]   It's interesting, and Harry, I think you've written a little bit about this, that Google
[01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:03.620]   is trying to get back into Android tablets after essentially seeding the tablet market
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:07.460]   to Samsung and to some degree to Apple.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:13.020]   Google has for some reason decided that they want to do tablets again.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:14.020]   J.R.
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:17.500]   Raphael, he writes for Fast Company, but he also writes for Computer World.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:23.380]   And he had a great story on the history, the long and sad history of Android tablets,
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:29.460]   which involves essentially Google not investing enough to make it into a true competitor to
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.980]   the iPad.
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:34.100]   And therefore, they're never been terribly satisfying.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:38.980]   And even when they acquired an interesting company called Bump Top, they didn't do much
[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:40.060]   with it.
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:45.540]   And it does feel a little bit like Samsung in the last few years has done way more of
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:51.620]   the heavy lifting than Google has to try to make decent Android tablets.
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:56.580]   But there's even though Samsung actually has done some of the software layers on their
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:47:00.980]   own tablets, there's a limit to what they can do since it's not their operating system.
[01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:07.340]   People love Google does, but Google, J.R. did break the news that Google has hired somebody
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:09.060]   to be in charge of Android tablets.
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:10.060]   And maybe that's a hopeful sign.
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.820]   Yeah, I found a job listing and everything.
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:18.460]   Google made one of my favorite tablets ever, which was that seven inch camera with the
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:19.460]   name of it.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:20.460]   Nexus.
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:21.460]   Nexus, yeah.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:22.460]   Incredible.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:23.460]   Love that.
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:25.140]   And then just let it go.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:28.900]   Remember the Motorola zoom zoom with an X?
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:31.740]   God, blackberry, blackberry added.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:33.820]   Blackberry tablet playbook.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:38.420]   Yeah, there were all those after the iPad came out.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:43.700]   There were a lot of incredibly aggressively marketed Android tablets.
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.900]   The HP touchpad, which was WebOS.
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:48.900]   Yes.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:49.900]   Late lamented.
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:55.900]   I think it was Harry who pointed out that we are in the tablet having a resurgence kind
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:48:02.220]   of period with so much more being done via video and as opposed to in person, including,
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:08.900]   you know, if it's school or work or we had to take a COVID test that was video monitored
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:11.060]   and you're not going to do that on your phone.
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.060]   Right.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:14.060]   It's a great zoom device.
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.060]   Zoom the video conference.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:23.600]   as a matter of fact the best Zoom device in our household is a 13" 20/20 iPad Pro because
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:28.460]   it has like 5 microphones and it has this great noise cancellation and it has really
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:35.220]   loud sound so you can be in a room and put that almost anywhere and have a really good
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:47.860]   Zoom call. Is it too late for Google to get back into the tablet marketplace and let it
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:49:04.900]   go for so long? I mean it seems like they spent the last few years way more interested in Chromebooks and they've made Chromebooks that are essentially convertible tablets in which run Android apps and that seems like it's where their heart is but there are all these developers out there who have never invested a huge amount of attention in developing great Android tablet apps because there wasn't
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:10.900]   great Android tablets for the most part to run them and so it's not just Google, they'd have
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:15.900]   to do a lot of catch up, the hardware manufacturer would have to do it too and developers would
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:20.140]   have to be interested in a way that they have logically enough not been interested for a
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:26.740]   long time. Google can be extremely frustrating company, I really want them to do well and
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:33.900]   they seem to be very short attention span. Because I mean there should be competition
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:39.300]   for the iPad. Apple doesn't need to, shouldn't dominate that space. I mean Samsung's making
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:42.900]   some nice tablets. You know where the problem is? It's actually a really nice one. They are.
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:47.900]   And that's what J.R.'s point is that Samsung's done all the heavy lifting so far but you can't
[01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:53.900]   fully blame Google because it's also the lack of tablet apps. When Google put out tablets
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:57.500]   the app makers didn't respond by making apps, maybe it was too hard to do with Android,
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:01.900]   I don't know, but didn't respond by making apps that adapted well to all that screen real
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:06.380]   estate. It's kind of checking in the ad. Yeah, you've got to make something that they want
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:10.900]   to develop for. Let's take a little break. I do want to talk about the FBI. Apparently
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:18.780]   they were very interested in buying NSO groups Pegasus a couple of years back. Our show
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:25.540]   today brought to you by Wealthfront. A lot of investment apps make it easy to start trading
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:31.900]   but just because it's easy to do so doesn't mean you know what you're doing. I think people
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:39.220]   have learned maybe it shouldn't be that easy. I think it's really, look, I am not going to
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:45.900]   knock you. My kids love the idea of buying cryptocurrency or buying a hot stock because
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:50.180]   that's what, you know, it's a product they love. That's fine. But honestly, and I tell
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:56.340]   them this over and over again, if you want to build wealth, you need a slower strategy

[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:17.500]   about saving money the smart way. And I have to say, you still have plenty of fun with
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:22.060]   Wealthfront. You can start investing in no time with Wealthfront's classic portfolio.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:27.420]   That's a no brainer. Or you can still make it your own with things you care about. Socially
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:33.260]   responsible funds love that idea technology funds. You can even do crypto. They have crypto

[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:52.300]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech. Great week this week. We
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:57.380]   had a lot of fun. In fact, I think we have a little mini movie you can watch to share
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:03.580]   the excitement. But I feel like I am the biggest walking contradiction on this planet.
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:10.580]   There's so many times I hear in a day how someone just assumes that I'm just such a
[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:21.020]   nice guy. But I feel like man, let me show you what my t-shirt says today. It says no.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:26.820]   Previously on Twit, Tech News Weekly. Google killed off flock this week. They replaced
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:32.780]   it with something called topics. Topics is an API that will essentially look at your browsing
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:37.860]   behavior and it will filter that into topics that you're interested in.
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:43.540]   All about Android. It is the Nexigo Air T2 wireless earbuds. What struck me about these
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:52.020]   was that this little case is so thin and so tiny. I don't know how they did it. The little
[01:53:52.020 --> 01:53:56.860]   like sub pocket inside your jacket. Yeah. It fits in the pocket with your pocket. That's
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:00.620]   what it says. It fits in the pocket with your pocket with your pocket. It passes Ron's pocket
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:08.220]   test when she used to run with tablets. Windows Weekly. How do you explain this to mainstream
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:13.260]   users who hear, "Oh, Android apps on Windows?" So I can just get any Android app on Windows,
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:17.420]   right? But that's not how it's going to work. As Twindles say, the good news is you'll
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:25.100]   be able to get Candy Crush finally on Windows. Twit. Thank goodness, right? It's about time.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:30.940]   Love tech. You will love Twit all week long. Pardon me? We're doing important things.
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:35.500]   Yes. Candy Crush. Yeah. Actually, I think you could get Candy Crush in Windows for quite a
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:40.380]   while. In fact, I think you get it whether you want or not. That's the joke of it all.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:44.700]   Yeah. We talked about that last week, the big acquisition of Activision,
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:50.940]   Microsoft's biggest acquisition to date. New York Times, Sunday Times today.
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:55:01.500]   Article about the FBI and Pegasus. So it turns out, we've been talking a lot about NSO Group's
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:08.860]   Pegasus, which was a zero-click software that allowed a lot of authoritarian regimes to hack
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:15.580]   activists and journalists, friends of Jamal Khashoggi hacked by the Saudi Arabians before he was murdered.
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:22.860]   Well, first time ever, we've heard this story, the FBI secretly bought
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:33.340]   Israeli spyware and explored hacking US phones with Pegasus. This was back in 2017.
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:40.860]   Interestingly, it was right after they first got it that we started to see all the news stories
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:49.900]   about Khashoggi and Pegasus being used for less positive things against dissidents
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:57.500]   in the United Arab Emirates and against women's right activists in Saudi Arabia.
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:05.260]   CIA bought Pegasus. We've known this to help in Djibouti, an American ally.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:11.180]   They were fighting terrorism. In the UAE, Pegasus was used to hack the phone of a critic of the
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:22.700]   government. The FBI decided to back off a little bit on this and fortunately decided not to buy it,
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:30.860]   but it's been interesting because, remember, the president decided to sanction the NSO Group
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:39.900]   just a few months ago. Now we know that the FBI bought and tested NSO software for years.
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:43.260]   They plans were to use it for domestic surveillance.
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:52.060]   They bought a bunch of burner phones. By the way, the Pegasus equipment is still in a new
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:57:01.900]   Jersey building used by the FBI. I don't know. That conversation we were having about Apple
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:05.100]   taking a privacy stand. This takes that right off the table.
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:12.460]   From the article, it's an independent solution that requires no cooperation from AT&T, Verizon,
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:20.780]   Apple, or Google. The system, it says, this is from a brochure that was presented to the FBI,
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:24.780]   will turn your target smartphone into an intelligence goldmine.
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:29.900]   It turns on. You can use it to zero-click. That's what you're talking about, which means you don't
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:36.220]   have to do anything. You just send them a text and boom, you're in.
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:40.940]   Among other things, you can turn on the microphone, the camera, you can see all the emails,
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:44.300]   you can see all the text messages, you can see everything that's going on.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:52.460]   It turns the phone into this most amazing spy device. NSO Group says that actually they have a
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:57.420]   switch in Pegasus that means it can't be used on US phone numbers.
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:06.060]   But Company also gave the agency a demonstration of Phantom, another product which can hack American
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:15.500]   phones. And did for that demonstration. There's nothing really to say about that. It's good that
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:20.860]   the Times got that story and something to pay attention to. It's a great piece. It has a lot of
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:28.380]   detail on the way that Israel leveraged their relationship with NSO to essentially get favors
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:34.220]   from other companies who wanted access to NSO's technology. It was a real point of political
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:38.620]   leverage for a long time. I think anybody listening, anybody who's been following the coverage of
[01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:46.700]   Pegasus and so forth, probably assumes that, well, we're doing it too. We may not know about it,
[01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:52.380]   but we're doing it too. And this just proves, yeah, as a matter of fact, we have been all this time.
[01:58:54.140 --> 01:58:58.700]   And they partnered with Mexico. Yeah, that's how they got El Chapo. Yeah.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:08.140]   It was on El Chapo's phone. Let's see. I mentioned Meta's building an AI supercomputer that will
[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:13.820]   be the world's fastest by the end of 2022. What could possibly go wrong? Why shouldn't Mark Zuckerberg
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:21.820]   the world's fastest AI? Made out of NVIDIA hardware.
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:32.220]   Not a fan of Facebook and I've long ago kind of stopped using the platform by large.
[01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:36.780]   Yeah. Except for Instagram because I need to know where to get my underwear.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:40.700]   But other than that, so I just stopped using Instagram for the reason you mentioned. I kept
[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:46.860]   buying stuff. And by the way, unlike the Twitch stuff, like half of the stuff I got on Instagram,
[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:50.460]   I was disappointed with that's actually one of the reasons I stopped one buying stuff.
[01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:56.380]   Okay. Can I tell you one thing not to buy on Instagram? Yeah. I can't believe I bought this.
[01:59:56.380 --> 02:00:01.980]   Underwear? No. The underwear's been fine. Although when I got it, it said, "Do not wash in the
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:07.740]   washing machine," which made me think that's not really useful when it comes to underwear.
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:15.260]   So I have been anyway and it hasn't fallen apart. So I don't know how people with shoulders sleep.
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:22.460]   Because unless you sleep on your back, which I cannot do, the shoulder seems to impinge
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:28.700]   on your sleeping and it's not comfortable. So there's an ad which I don't know if you've seen it. I
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:36.060]   saw it for a long time. I think must know I got a problem. For this pillow that you put your arm in
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:42.940]   and it's called medcline and it holds you up in your arms and then your
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:48.460]   shoulder will be comfortable. I don't know why I bought this thing. It must have been in the
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:55.020]   middle of the night. Does it work? Well, I guess. Yeah. If you don't mind sleeping on a wedge.
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:01:03.580]   With your arm in a hole. Does it sound good? Anyway, the problem is now, and it comes with
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:10.140]   this giant worm of a body pillow. And it was expensive. I don't know what I was thinking. I
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:14.060]   must, I swear to God, it was the middle of the night. That's the problem with Instagram. It's 4am.
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:18.140]   You're scrolling, doom scrolling, and then you buy whatever it is because you're completely
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:23.900]   at their mercy. Anyway, if anybody wants this thing, it's occupying a lot of space.
[02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:30.140]   And was that an example of a targeted ad? Do they know you were somebody with shoulders?
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:35.340]   It must have been a sweet question. The weird thing is now I will still see it forever. I mean,
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:39.340]   like, it's never going to leave my feet now. Even though I bought it.
[02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:44.940]   But my disclaimer was I don't use Facebook or Instagram anymore. I essentially sent me
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:52.300]   retired from social media in 2018. Yes. Smart man. But and yeah, there's a whole
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:58.860]   another thread to there, which was one of the smartest things I did. But the the the butt is that
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:05.580]   one of the things that gets underestimated about Facebook is their their technical prowess.
[02:02:05.580 --> 02:02:14.700]   They from a technical standpoint are genius. And the interesting thing is like they figure it out
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:20.220]   a lot. They essentially were the ones that figured out how to scale the database to to web scale.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:27.260]   It blows me away. They've got three and a half billion users and it's like fast. It's amazing.
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:33.500]   Yeah. So they will anything where it's a technical problem to solve, they will win.
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:39.820]   I mean, I pretty much, you know, they just are they are incredible at that. Well, they hire a
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:44.620]   really good people. The best engineers, including our own Colleen Kelly work for them.
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:53.740]   I met when I was in Mexico, I met a guy who works in the ready for production department,
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:57.340]   where they get stuff ready to put into production. So they testing and all that stuff.
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:00.780]   And these are really smart people doing amazing things. Look at this,
[02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:08.140]   this meta data center research super cluster phase one. If you're worried about Skynet,
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:18.140]   forget Google. This is the net. This is Skynet. Yeah, 175 petabytes of bulk storage, 46 petabytes
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:29.340]   of cash of cash storage, 10 petabytes NFS storage. It's got a 6,080 NVIDIA A100 GPUs,
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:41.980]   6,000 of them, a 200 gigabit HDR and Finneband network per GPU. Every GPU has 200 gigabits
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:47.500]   of network. This thing's insane. What are you going to use it for?
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:53.020]   This kind of technology, yeah, metaverse, this kind of technology, this is the stuff that they
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:59.820]   are, they are like the best in the world at scale. They are, they're incredible. I do,
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:09.660]   I do my doubts that they that they could win at metaverse, to be honest. But just, and the
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:16.380]   brand change was certainly smart on their part. But it kind of saw talking about the metaverse.
[02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:23.100]   It was very successful in that regard. It was, but they also, for people under 30,
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:27.900]   they've lost that demographic. They know it too, right? They're brand. Yeah,
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:33.020]   they're brand is. But you say that, but Instagram is very popular in that crowd, right?
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:40.780]   It is. I mean, I think I'm a little dwindle. I'm more worried. I think that they realize that,
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:46.220]   social media may not be their future, but developing something that comes up with
[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:50.700]   artificial general intelligence, first time ever. That's what they're building.
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:56.620]   I'm convinced that's what they want to build. They say, oh, this will help us train AI systems
[02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:05.580]   for voice recognition. Yeah, that's it. You don't need 16,000 GPUs
[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:09.500]   to for voice recognition. Yeah.
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:15.500]   And I don't know about them. No. Agreed. I do worry about them because I think they're,
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:20.780]   they're probably the most amoral company in the tech industry. Like they, they, they really only
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:26.060]   care about winning, you know, from, from the top down. And they've shown that through their
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:32.060]   actions over and over again, not that there's a, there is a lack, there is an ethics problem in
[02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:37.500]   Silicon Valley in general, but they are the ones that care the least. They will, they will do whatever
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:42.780]   it takes to win and then pay the fines that they have to to the government afterwards when they get
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:49.100]   sued, you know, because of done. We help RSC. That's what they're calling this thing. We'll help us
[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:54.780]   build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real time voice translations
[02:05:55.660 --> 02:06:00.780]   to large groups of people each speaker in a different language so they can seamlessly
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:05.820]   collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together. I have to think it's a little
[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:12.220]   bit more than that we're talking about here. A little bit more than that. Yeah, I wouldn't be,
[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:17.980]   I mean, if you're Mark, you've got basically infinite resources. You've got this problem of
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:25.980]   your, of your customer base aging out. You need the next big thing. Skynet. Why not?
[02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:34.620]   Someone's going to do it. So why not? Exactly. I have absolute, absolutely convinced that that's
[02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:39.340]   what this is all about. They're probably trying to have James Barrett back on the network. Yeah,
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:46.700]   they want to build it. You said it a general AI. And I'm terrified. If it's, if it's got Mark's
[02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:53.900]   brain in it, I'm really scared. Up until now, the companies that might be able to lay claim to
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:59.180]   having the world's most powerful supercomputer urban companies like IBM, which I don't think
[02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:05.020]   people spend a lot of time worrying about these days. Facebook having it as just a different
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:11.740]   situation. Absolutely. Absolutely. Steam Decks coming out February 25th. I am expecting an
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:17.660]   article from you, Harry. We'll see if you can get one. Good luck. I'm signed up, but I don't,
[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:25.500]   this is Valve's portable Linux based gaming system that there was a lot of interest when they
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:34.140]   announced it a year ago, and it's coming out in less than a month. Do you care about a robot
[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:41.660]   bartender that will serve up cocktails at the Winter Olympics? I like that a lot better than
[02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:48.460]   Metas. Supercomputer? This actually, they had this on the cruise ship we went on a few years ago.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:55.020]   They're doing this because of COVID. They don't want real bartenders. So if you're going to get
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:08:00.940]   drunk at the Winter Olympics, this robot will be happy to serve you a minute and a half for a drink
[02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:12.460]   is way too long. I think we can say we've covered the waterfront. Is there anything I missed?
[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:18.060]   The big stories that you guys, you are all covering this all the time. Anything I missed?
[02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:24.780]   I think we've done it all here. One big one that I thought was great last week was,
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:31.980]   ARK Invest did their release their release search on Big Ideas 2022, so the 14
[02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:36.860]   transformative technologies to watch this year. That's the version from Vala Afshar
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:42.780]   on ZVNet, right? And about it, everybody, they released all of their research for free.
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:49.820]   Unlike some of the agencies out there, they essentially kind of open source their research,
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:56.940]   which is pretty cool. But this is a great read on where a lot of these things are from Web3 to
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:09:05.900]   autonomous vehicles to AI, to genomics and blockchain. They do some really
[02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:14.380]   different kind of research on these things and have a very great perspective on a lot of it.
[02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:20.620]   And so I think that for this audience, there's a lot of people that will appreciate some of
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:27.100]   the line-up for us. What's coming? What should we get ready for besides SkyNet?
[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:34.860]   Yeah, the biggest is AI. So today, AI is a 10 trillion industry,
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:42.220]   a 10 trillion dollar industry, and 2030, they see it as 108 trillion. So that's the biggest one.
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:50.620]   Blockchain today is 1.4 trillion. In 2030, it's 50 trillion. So a lot of these you'd expect,
[02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:56.300]   battery technology is 1.5 trillion. They see that as 32 trillion. Those are the-
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:57.900]   To talk about fusion at all.
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:05.740]   About nuclear fusion reactor on the Flus Compaxeter.
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:11.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm just Mr. Fusion. Yeah, that's the one. No, I'm talking about fusion
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:16.300]   energy because I feel like if there's anything that's going to save society, it's coming up
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:22.140]   with cold fusion. And I know a lot of investors are throwing money into this, and I wonder,
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:26.060]   is it scientifically even feasible or is this money thrown away?
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:32.460]   This did not come up in here. But you're right, though, that energy for this century-
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:33.580]   Yeah.
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:37.900]   You know, energy is the big one, right? Because more and more of what we do is going to
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:45.420]   require energy. We know the fossil fuel story. So energy is going to be a huge story for-
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:51.020]   That's more of like a 20-50-between now in the 2050 story than 2030.
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:53.420]   But I think you're on the right side.
[02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:57.980]   No, this is going to matter if we don't solve the climate crisis, if you ask me.
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:03.900]   You're going to have genome editing in the blockchain, but if the ocean level is risen 10 feet,
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:09.100]   then I'm not going to make that much difference. Yeah, it's interesting this graph of the 14
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:13.980]   transformative technologies. Autonomous mobility, yes, reusable rockets, yes,
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:20.860]   blockchain, IoT, AI, robotics. Yeah, it's going to be an interesting world.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:27.340]   These folks have some ETF funds as well that have gotten crushed in the recent,
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:36.620]   Wall Street scare on high growth stocks. But put all that aside, that's not related to this
[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:43.260]   research so much. This research is really just basic research on where the world,
[02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:48.780]   where the technology industry is going. And they do some of the most compelling stuff,
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:53.260]   and they do it out in the public and they release it for everybody for free to look at.
[02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:57.820]   So there's a lot in there that's worth putting some time into.
[02:11:57.820 --> 02:12:00.860]   Vala F. Shar's article on ZDNA, very, very interesting.
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:05.580]   And I forgot when we started the show, I promised the chatroom we would cover the
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:10.460]   net neutrality story, and I can do that quickly. Oh, yes, no, that's absolutely the case.
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:17.180]   Okay. So this is a big deal. The California courts, well, go ahead, you tell us the story.
[02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:23.900]   So I would just recommend for anybody who wants to catch up and see how we got here.
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:29.020]   There's a really good Wikipedia page called net neutrality in the United States that takes you
[02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:35.420]   through the whole weird back and forth history of net neutrality in Title 1 and Title 2.
[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:39.180]   And I'm not going to try and go through that. I'll just refer you to that page.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:47.260]   But the latest salvo over the table tennis net in this ongoing struggle is, well,
[02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:54.700]   here I'll tee it up by saying that the FCC under the Trump administration did away with what was
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:13:03.020]   called the open internet order, which was a national net neutrality regulation that went away under
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:08.780]   Trump. And California responded by saying, okay, well, we're going to basically duplicate the
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:14.780]   open internet order here in California with a few tweaks. And they did. And of course,
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:20.540]   that was challenged in court. And what happened just this last week is the Ninth Circuit, which is our
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:26.620]   circuit court of appeals in this part of the world, decided that that California law could
[02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:32.700]   actually stand. The other side had argued that it was preempted by federal law. There are certain
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:38.060]   things that the states aren't supposed to touch because that's the province of federal law.
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:45.100]   And interstate commerce tends to be one of those sort of hallmark things. But the Ninth Circuit
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:54.700]   decided no, because there was this reclassification of net neutrality from Title 2 to Title 1. So
[02:13:54.700 --> 02:14:02.460]   we're going from common carriers to information services that this actually takes it out of federal
[02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:08.460]   preemption and leaves it to the states. So that's what the Ninth Circuit decided. I'm sure at some
[02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:14.940]   point, another circuit will decide something else for that part of the country, which means this
[02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:20.140]   will wind up in front of the Supreme Court. That's the question for you. Yes. Because remember,
[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:29.900]   you know, let's call a spade a spade. Adjut freaking pie, who managed to get the net neutrality
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:37.260]   order out, then said, and by the way, you states you don't you don't you do it. And then California
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:43.900]   said, oh, yeah, stop me. And and Adjut sued. But the Ninth Circuit Court, which is very liberal,
[02:14:43.900 --> 02:14:53.660]   said the FCC has given up their authority to preempt this by saying this is kind of interesting
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:15:00.940]   that internet access is an information service. Yeah, that was the whole debate. Now, this is for
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:06.540]   the Ninth Circuit, it's federal, right? Yes, that's the federal court of appeals for our part of the
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:11.580]   world. And I really, you know, I mean, different people will say, yes, there are political overtones
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:17.820]   to net neutrality. But but I have a hard time thinking of it as a political issue where, you know,
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:21.980]   I agree to everything's now. I mean, nowadays, that's right. Exactly. So,
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:31.260]   I mean, small businesses definitely benefit from net neutrality. So this was ISP's brought this
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:38.860]   suit, right? Yes. Like Horizon 18 T. Yes. And and so we're going to
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:45.980]   either see this go to the Supreme Court or the next move on the chessboard or on the table tennis
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:55.660]   table, mixing my metaphors. We'll, you know, what there is, there has been a hope that perhaps
[02:15:55.660 --> 02:16:02.860]   Congress would act on this and take this off the table tennis table, at least as far as we're
[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:08.380]   going back and forth in the courts and then it goes to the federal circuit and then back to the
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:13.980]   states and, you know, Congress could circumvent all that by just enacting a net neutrality law.
[02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:17.660]   So we'll see if that would be nice. I don't know. Any of that happens.
[02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:22.460]   Hold high hopes for that. But at least the Ninth Circuit has upheld it.
[02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:29.580]   And maybe that will be enough, although I think the National Cable Television Association
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:34.860]   will probably pursue this farther. And of course, in other states will bring up this and so forth
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:40.220]   and so on. Right. And then the other sort of coda to that is, of course, if this does wind up
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:45.260]   in front of the Supreme Court and lots of other tech policy issues are, you know,
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:49.980]   coming down the pipe to the Supreme Court, I guess it's worth mentioning that Justice Breyer
[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:56.380]   announced his retirement and a replacement for him is being sought. And there's a really nice
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:02.620]   piece at, I really love the Washington Post's Cybersecurity 202. If folks are not reading that,
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:08.540]   it is a great publication. And Joseph Marks and Aaron Schaffr there did a nice summary of
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:18.140]   what Breyer's retirement and the impact on the court might be what sort of issues the court can
[02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:23.980]   be expected to take on in the next several years. And as they point out,
[02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:30.460]   Justice Breyer was never really involved in a lot of tech policy decisions. So it's not exactly
[02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:38.620]   leaving a void there, but that it also appears none of the judges being considered to replace him
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:44.940]   have a lengthy track record in cyber and privacy cases. But as they point out, they're all in
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:50.620]   their 40s or 50s, which may suggest a closer familiarity with technology and its pitfalls
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:57.180]   than some of the older justices. So we can just keep our fingers crossed that whoever replaces Breyer
[02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:02.380]   has a little bit more sort of real world experience with the kinds of technologies that they're going
[02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:07.900]   to be making important decisions about. And more importantly, what was the name of that thing that
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:14.780]   you put your phone in so you wouldn't lose it on the slopes? Oh, it is called. Yes, the chat room
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:21.180]   was already clamoring. So I put it there. It's called the hangtime koala. And by the way, it benefits
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:28.700]   koalas if you get one, right? Hashtag not an ad. Koala, did you get the koala 2.0 super grip?
[02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:34.700]   I did. It works very well. You know, I'm thinking for Abby, because she breaks her phone very
[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:39.580]   regularly. Maybe, although if you're not skiing and you're wearing this, you might look a little
[02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:47.260]   strange. But it's a rubber clip that holds the phone and keeps you from dropping it. And when you
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:54.700]   get a koala, you help a koala because they give 20% for koala habitat. They must be from Australia,
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:19:00.380]   right? I would think. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't research it much when I bought. I just clicked on the ad
[02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:05.740]   like with your underwear. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was it the middle of it? Actually, you need this one
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:10.940]   actually is a quality product. You need this one. Yes. Yes. Don't put it in the wash, though.
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:17.580]   Anything hairy that you think we should be thinking about this week in the tech world?
[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:22.380]   In terms of things that intrigue me, there was a lot of scuttle about about a potential apple
[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:31.180]   spring event, maybe with a genuinely new MacBook Air, which makes sense because they've like barely
[02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:34.860]   touched it. Oh, that would make me... Since the second generation one from years ago,
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:39.900]   so potentially very exciting. I mean, they did an all new MacBook Pro last year and an all new iMac.
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:45.660]   So the time is kind of right. I'm loving I have the 14 inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro, and it's
[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:51.660]   just a beautiful laptop. But you've tempted me with that XPS, the Dell XPS, I must say.
[02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:54.940]   I want to tempt that. They're totally nice. I wasn't going to get it because I thought,
[02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:58.860]   well, they put a trackpad on it. I don't like the trackpad, but it sounds like it's better than
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:05.020]   just a trackpad. It's not quite a trackpad. No, it kind of went their own way. And I think Jason,
[02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:12.780]   you sound like you liked it as well. So Dan Ackerman from CNET had a really great opinion of it.
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:19.980]   Okay. And so he's my guru when it comes to... I own every XPS for years. I was a big fan of the
[02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:25.020]   XPS series. So maybe it's time. And also, by the way, they always run Linux really nicely.
[02:20:25.020 --> 02:20:28.700]   I'm not buying another Windows machine, that's for sure.
[02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:36.860]   Thank you. You are awesome, Jason Heiner. He is now officially editor in chief at ZDNet. He's a
[02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:41.980]   big shot, but he still dains to appear on this little show. Thank you, Jason. I appreciate it.
[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:44.140]   Always a pleasure. Still a Louisville, right though.
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:45.340]   It's a Louisville.
[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:46.380]   It's a Louisville.
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:49.260]   All right. It's great to see you again. Denise Howell.
[02:20:49.260 --> 02:20:52.780]   I miss you. It's wonderful to see you and your fisherman's sweater.
[02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:53.820]   Thank you. Yes.
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:54.460]   Realmen.
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:57.740]   I guess I wore this in honor of the door Easter.
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.540]   Yeah. Well, you're in Southern California. You're probably okay.
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:06.460]   Yes. This is definitely overkill for our climate today.
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:11.420]   Thank you for being here. We really appreciate it.
[02:21:11.420 --> 02:21:12.060]   My pleasure.
[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:15.580]   And of course, thank you so much, Mr. Harry McCracken.
[02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:18.300]   Give my regards to Marie. He's the editor. I will.
[02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:20.300]   Fast company, technology editor.
[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:26.140]   Does great stuff. We look forward to more from you in Fast Company. Thanks, Harry.
