[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   >> No, but "Just a Geek" is -- I think exactly it is that
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   that's kind of how you self-identify now.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   >> It is.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I've been trying for years after spending the first, like,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   maybe, I don't know, two-thirds of my life feeling like I had
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   to apologize for being a geek and that all geeks had to
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   apologize for these things that we love.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I just decided that I was not going to be ashamed of it
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   and I wasn't going to be sorry for it and that I was going to
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   help.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I was going to join the movement.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Like, I'm not leading it or anything.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It was already kind of going on, but I thought I would join
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   the movement to make geek a non-pajorative term and something
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   to be proud of.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> Well, I think Bill Gates did a lot by becoming the richest
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   man in the world.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> Yeah, but he was kind of a dick about the whole thing, too.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You know, I mean, it's great that he's the richest man in the
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   world, like, good for him.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And I guess without him, there wouldn't be an Xbox 360, so
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I'm grateful for that.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> I don't know about that.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   >> But, well, I mean, with no Microsoft, I don't know if the
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   360, maybe, you know, this is like the butterfly flapping its
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   wings, you know, maybe things would be a little bit different
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   than they are right now.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   >> Well, but talk about being a dick.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Bill Gates speaking at the TED conference.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   >> Oh, biggest dick move ever.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> So he's talking about malaria and, you know, how he and his
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   foundation or trying to eradicate malaria brings out, whips out
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   a jar of mosquitoes, lets him out, says, "All that, no, poor
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   people shouldn't be the only people who have to suffer and let them
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   out."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   >> Yeah, you know, that's like, why not just serve a nice big buffet
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   and then tell everyone that you've deliberately infected it
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   with Sam and Ella, because not only people who have, you know,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   who live in third world countries have to deal with that.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Like, you can make your point in a much more acceptable way.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> They get a lot of press.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   >> There's something overlooked in the story, and I think the
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   press is part of the problem.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   >> What's that?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   >> For not pointing this out.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's illegal to import mosquitoes or any kind of disease
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   vector into the state of California.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It violates a number of state and federal laws.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I know two or three people that have filed formal complaints
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   against Bill in this idiotic study.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   >> You're kidding.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   People in the Ted audience?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   >> No, no, just people who witnessed it on TV.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   >> Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Well, you know, I'm sure they weren't malaria infected, but
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   as anybody- >> It doesn't make any difference.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   There's 50 different kinds of vectors that mosquitoes carry,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   not malaria, not the least of them.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   >> He's not like he, these are irradiated mosquitoes.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   >> You cannot bring bugs into the state of California, period.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   >> Well, maybe he got them in California.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> Well, now, if he got them in California, that's different.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   >> Maybe he went to the mosquito shack on 101.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's right there, like right outside of Colorado.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   >> The mosquito shack, you know, where they also serve burgers,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   by the way.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   >> They do there, and I understand they're delicious.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> The mosquitoes are the burgers.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   >> As long as there are mosquitoes, but you make the point,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   which I think everybody in the audience must have been thinking is,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   well, we don't know, I mean, there could be any number of things.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   West Nile, this mosquito could be carrying you don't know.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   How do you know?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   What do you examine each one individually with four steps?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   >> He read them himself.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   >> Maybe there's- >> Well, listen, in his defense,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   who heard of Bill Gates before Ted?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   >> He's famous now.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   >> I mean, really, you know?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> Everybody's falling on Twitter.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   >> I might just have to go do a Chris Crocker-esque
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Leap Bill Gates alone video to kind of put the whole thing into perspective.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   >> Lisa, did you go to Ted?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   >> No.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   >> Did you go to Ted Will?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   >> I did not.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   >> John C. Devorek, did you go to Ted?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   >> No.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   >> Okay, we're not at Ted.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   >> Would you go?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   >> I listened to all the talks on lines.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   >> I love the Ted talks.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   >> So who actually meet, do you guys look forward to going to big trade shows?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   >> No.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   >> Like something like CES or whatever.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   >> I know John does it because he's always whining at me.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   >> Yeah, I love it.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   That and sticking pins in my eyes are two of my favorite things.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   >> Okay, so we agree on this.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I hate going to trade shows.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I can't stand it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And one of the things I really like about Ted is that all the talks that I would have to
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   go endure the crowds and the expense to go sit through, I can just get them all online.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So, you know, and also when I listen to Ted at home, 100% fewer mosquitoes.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   >> You know, the one thing that you go to these events for though is there's a lot of
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   it's for social socialization.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   You go there.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.240]   So you can see all these people you haven't seen for maybe a year and then you can promise
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.040]   to see them during the year, go have a lunch, have dinner, they never see them again.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.400]   For another year, you go to the event the next year and you say the same thing and that
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.000]   goes on forever and I kind of maintain some sort of weird relationship.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   >> I'd go to Ted if I got invited.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I'd like to go to Ted.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Ted looks really cool.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   >> Why don't you go?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   >> It's $6,000.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That's why.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   >> Oh, peanuts for you.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.720]   >> Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose, revisions three went.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   By the way, that would have hired entire staff, people that they've laid off.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.240]   Did anybody go to Dragon Con?
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.120]   >> No, you want to lease it.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:45.160]   >> Dragon Con happens in August and it actually directly conflicts with the Penny Arcade Expo.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   That I can't miss.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.360]   Penny Arcade Expo is like my woodstock.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.440]   >> You're like, I have to go.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.840]   >> Patrick's a big Penny Arcade fan too.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.680]   >> Oh, by the way, somebody points out you can also get anaphylactic shock.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   Some people are going to.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.240]   >> Yeah, if you're allergic to mosquitoes.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   >> Man.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.920]   So I mean, it seemed like a kind of a dick move.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   May we say.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.720]   >> Maybe just being silly.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.080]   >> I think I'm going to fill up a jar with like peanuts that are painted to look like
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.800]   ladybugs and I'm going to dump them out on the floor at the next conference I go to.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.280]   And I'm going to say, you know, you don't have to be at Ted to be exposed to a stupid
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.760]   goose that he's done.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   I better write that down.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.760]   >> That's good.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   So here talk about stupid.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   I love this.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.880]   The Nielsen Corporation, which does the ratings or the television ratings.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:47.720]   I guess this might have been precipitated by an executive who hit the reply all button
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:54.920]   a couple of months ago and wrote some stupid things because the Nielsen Corporation with
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:01.800]   35,000 employees worldwide has removed the reply to all button from its outlook.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.880]   There's no longer a reply to all button on any of their computers.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.480]   >> It's a bold move.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.680]   >> It's kind of a strange thing to do.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.680]   I can understand it.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.120]   If you've ever worked in a big corporation, which none of you have.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.280]   >> When does it make sense?
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.680]   >> Well, that reply to all times.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.240]   You get there's a little messages that go around in big corporations, General Motors.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.880]   Let's say you got 20 people on this on, let's say you're having a discussion over email,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.440]   even though I know you and Lisa, neither one of you use email.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.400]   >> How do you know that?
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.120]   >> I've been trying to correspond with her about something.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.800]   >> She and I email all the time.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   >> She's on Twitter.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.880]   >> She talks to me all the time.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.800]   >> I sent Leo an email this morning and he replied to me.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.200]   >> He replies on Sunday to email, ladies and gentlemen out there who want to get a whole
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   Leo.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.720]   >> I just put on, it's funny she said, because I just hired my sister to answer all my email
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.840]   and I just put one of those responders, which I've always hated that says, "I'm not going
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   to read your email, but my sister is."
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.320]   >> I'm going to gates.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.160]   So anyway, you have like 20 people and you want to reply to all, "We have to type in their
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.160]   name time after time."
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.480]   It doesn't make any sense, but I guess you can cut and paste.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.920]   >> Would it make more sense to train the executives?
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.960]   >> Don't let them go there.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   >> Yeah, but if you're going to try to do that, you may as well train them to, I don't know,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.600]   care about their mid-level employees.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.800]   That's never going to happen.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.600]   Maybe if there was a greater knowledge and better understanding of the most useful line
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.480]   in the email header, the BCC line, then it wouldn't be such an enormous issue.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.880]   >> Yeah, you know, maybe that's a good point.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:51.640]   This drives me to take the BCC out or just, you know, certainly they can afford to reconfigure
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:59.000]   their mail server and just change the reply all so that it goes out to BCC or train them
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.240]   to use mailing lists.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   It's not like mailing lists are brand new.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   >> Well, that's what they say.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   They just use the mailing list.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.480]   Don't reply to all, but I think it is kind of a key email.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.240]   >> I don't know why this is an interesting story.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.440]   >> Because, well, I don't know.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   Okay, you don't like it?
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.440]   We'll move on.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.560]   >> I think they should just have a team meeting where they talk about these issues and maybe
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.080]   have a group hug or something.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.480]   >> We actually said, reply to all got a lot of people in trouble at Tech TV.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:29.120]   Because you'd write a snotty response, actually, you know, you write a snotty response and
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.400]   you forget that the person that you're responding to is still on the two list and you reply
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.920]   to all and it goes out.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.960]   >> Most people do that on purpose.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.880]   >> Yeah, that's not your technique.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.080]   >> Yeah, and then you go, oh, whoops.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   Didn't mean to do that.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.400]   >> I don't think it's a real problem.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.640]   I mean, if you're using something like Gmail, you know, it all sort of like your reply sits
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.120]   in line with your correspondence with that person.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.160]   No, it doesn't seem like it really adds a lot of bulk.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.960]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   >> It's not about bulk.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.920]   It's not about fiber we're talking here.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.040]   It's about this executive vice president at the Nielsen corporation Mitchell Habib, who
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.880]   six months ago, replied to all with a particularly aliener, an air again message about his underlings
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.240]   that went to 35,000 Nielsen's.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   >> Ah, gotcha.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.760]   >> Yeah, you see, you don't want to change the process when people do stuff like that.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   >> Oh, that's a good thing.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.680]   >> Yeah, you want to cost Darwin's.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.920]   >> Yeah, it's Darwinian.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:31.720]   Speaking of which, by the way, Darwin's 200th anniversary of his birth is Friday.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.360]   >> So I want to mention something.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   >> Congratulations.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   >> I don't know if you forgot a couple of things I got to mention.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   >> Okay, yeah.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.040]   >> I got some things to mention too, as long as we're going to do.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.800]   >> Andrew Horowitz, one of our Twitterers, is going to be on CNBC this week and a whole
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.920]   hour of him on one of the shows.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.160]   I can't remember the day.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   I think it's Wednesday.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.360]   But he's also going to be on the John Stewart show.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.280]   He's beat us both to the show.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.760]   >> He's going to be on John Stewart?
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   >> That's big.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.400]   Have you been on John Stewart?
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.200]   Well, you're the only celebrity I know.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.000]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.800]   I am in the hierarchy of people who get invited to do that sort of thing and people who hope
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.400]   their entire lives to do that sort of thing.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.600]   I'm like way at the bottom of people who hope forever and ever and ever.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   >> You don't care about that.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   >> You've had.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.880]   >> No, no, I would love to do the John Stewart show, the Colbert Report.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.400]   Those sort of intelligent shows.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:29.520]   But if people sort of listen to me in certain places, but pretty much everywhere I go when
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.360]   it's like celebrity, whatever, I don't even make a blip on the radar.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.320]   Which is actually really, really nice.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.040]   I don't really want that to change.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.280]   >> When you were recognized, was it difficult?
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.720]   >> Yeah, it's sort of a double edged sword.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.160]   I was never into being famous.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.800]   And I never really wanted a lot of attention.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.720]   I never did the things that you do when you're famous.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   Never went to parties.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.320]   Never really tried not to go to a lot of premieres and junk just because I don't know.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.520]   I just didn't like that stuff.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.200]   I didn't like being around a lot of the people who were super into that.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.400]   And now that I kind of don't have to deal with that, I'm actually kind of really sort
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   of grateful.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.160]   >> So the answer to that question is no.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.320]   >> I just think it's nice to be able to get tables at restaurants.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.120]   That's all I want to be famous for.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.440]   >> Yeah, you know, just lie about your age.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.000]   >> I say I'm well-weighting it.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Usually it works.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.240]   >> Can I ask a Wil Wheaton question?
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.480]   When did you start blogging?
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.880]   I mean, when did that come into play?
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.920]   >> It was around 2000.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.920]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:47.280]   >> Like toward the end of spring, the beginning of summer in 2000.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.320]   I guess no, yeah, it was right before San Diego Comic Con in 2000 when I started doing that.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   >> That's early days of blogging.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:03.120]   Yeah, I mean, I remember the really early arguments about what we were going to call it.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.200]   And like what it was-
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.520]   >> I think I started in February 2001.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.320]   So I mean, that's a long time, 2000s, really early days.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.360]   >> Yeah, if you think these arguments about what Twitter is supposed to be and how you're
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:23.280]   supposed to use Twitter are annoying, go back to anything written from about 1999 to
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.040]   about what being a blogger is about and how that's supposed to work and all these ridiculous
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.360]   calls for blogger ethics panels and stupid things like that.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:39.800]   But it's been really fun to watch that world evolve and change and gain some sort of mainstream
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.640]   understanding and acceptance.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   >> Same thing with podcasting.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.520]   I kind of said, we should as podcasters look at what happened to blogging because we're
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.920]   just five years after.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.280]   And the same thing will happen.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.240]   And it has been in the way, although it's been accelerated.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.840]   I think podcasting has already gone down market in the way that blogging went down market.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:07.640]   >> It's really interesting to me to watch how this stuff sort of filters out into the mainstream
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.840]   kind of collective consciousness.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.400]   And I view podcasting the same way I view blogging.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:23.520]   I really see it as just another means of publishing and reaching an audience.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.480]   And my friend David says, let a thousand flowers bloom and clean up 990 weeds.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.320]   And I'm fine with that.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.440]   >> What about the fact that blogging has now become the bastion mostly of big groups like
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.960]   Engaget and Huffington Post?
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.520]   Do you think the individual blogger like you and Lisa, is there a future for you guys?
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.080]   >> Well, I don't think it's a zero sum game.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.960]   I certainly don't see myself competing within gadget and I don't see myself competing with
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.160]   Huffington Post.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.120]   I do my thing and they do their thing.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.520]   And just because we're published in the same medium doesn't really put us, I don't see
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   that putting us into competition with one another at all.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.520]   >> How about you, Lisa?
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:11.160]   Do you worry that individuals are going to get kind of pushed aside?
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:20.520]   >> I think that I mean, I mainly blog as a sort of creative outlet, but also to share
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.040]   photography tips and just my life with other things I do.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.680]   And it's sort of complementary to the other things that I do.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:37.000]   So if I create a video or if I take a great picture, I can share that with a lot of people.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.360]   And it's also about the interaction with the community.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.640]   And that's such a huge part of my online presence that I can interact sort of on a one to one
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:53.680]   basis with people and they have a way of communicating with me and of sharing their, what they're doing.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.200]   >> Well, I think blogging is still fun.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.640]   And I forgot, John, you've got a, what am I saying?
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.840]   You're a big devore on censored is probably the biggest blog of the mall.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.200]   I mean, of the individual blogs, are you doing very well, aren't you?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.640]   >> Yeah, I think Wheaton probably does as well, at least.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.640]   But he's right.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.360]   It's just a publishing vehicle and it's whatever it is.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.880]   I mean, it's just what happens to have a lot of critical, massive readers.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.760]   And I also don't think it's a zero sum game.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.000]   Although, if you're going to do something that's, you might like to try to do a tech
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.040]   blog and then it would have to go after, you would be competing.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.280]   But generally speaking, it's just a personality thing.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.880]   >> Yeah, it's important to have your.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.520]   >> Go ahead, Lisa.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.760]   >> It's important that you have your niche.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:51.360]   And for me and Will and I think it's like you have a very small place.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.880]   And as long as you continually create good content and
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.560]   that it suits your niche, then you're going to have people keep coming back.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:07.240]   >> Yeah, I'm primarily an entertainer, whether it's as an actor or
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.320]   writer or a voice actor.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.200]   I entertain people and I try to provide diversions for people.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.640]   And occasionally, I've been put in a position where I can be sort of a spokesperson for
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.280]   geek culture, gaming culture and things like that.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:30.040]   And what I love the most about where we are right now in the evolution of technology
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:36.360]   with regard to podcasting and also with blogging is it's this like,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:42.440]   giant global distribution network with a self-selecting audience.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.680]   And there's no tune in time.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.920]   And it really is not a zero sum sort of thing.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.920]   So a decade ago, it would have been impossible for me to convince anybody to
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.000]   give me television program.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.960]   Would have been impossible for me to get a widely read magazine column,
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.760]   just because that really is zero sum because you're really competing for
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.960]   space and audience and that sort of thing.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   But what we're doing today with your show and
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.360]   what I do five days a week on my blog is totally different and
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.080]   really couldn't exist at any other time.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.120]   >> No, we make our own space.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.320]   We don't need anybody to give us permission.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.800]   >> Yeah, so I really like this.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.400]   I'm about to embark on a really great experiment for the rest of this year.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.520]   Where I'm working on supporting myself and my family and
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.680]   trying some new creative ventures and some new styles of publishing and
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.800]   things exclusively using the internet.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.480]   And this stuff would not have been possible as recently as five years ago.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.200]   >> I'll give you an interesting fact.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   This I just read.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.240]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.960]   The New York Times would actually be cheaper.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.000]   It would cost the New York Times about half as much to give their big subscribers.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.040]   People have been subscribing for more than two years.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.760]   Each and every one of them to give them an Amazon Kindle and
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.840]   stop printing the paper.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   It would cost them half as much.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.360]   I saw that per year.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.440]   Just give them a Kindle and say, no more print.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.960]   >> That's what they should do.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.960]   >> I think that's what they're gonna do.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.440]   Whether they, I don't know if they should do it.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.680]   I would very much miss the print version.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.960]   But the cost of print, according to the Times,
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.080]   quarterly, they're 10Q.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.080]   They spend 63 million a quarter on raw materials, ink, newsprint,
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.600]   148 million on wages and benefits.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:42.720]   And so you take, take, take, actually take the 200 million out of their total costs for
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.800]   wages benefits staffing.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:50.520]   Their delivery costs and raw material costs, 644 million a year.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.120]   They say they have 830,000 subscribers for, who've been subscribing for more than two years.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.760]   You give each of them an Amazon Kindle, it only cost you $297 million.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.680]   >> Eliminate the trucks, the ink, the newsprint.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.120]   I think that's inevitable.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.680]   >> Do you think the public is going to go along with that?
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.840]   I mean the transition from print to online.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.880]   Because I've been working for the Vancouver Province and
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.960]   they're really making a drive to push people online.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.560]   But it's still really, really slow goings at this point.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.640]   >> Well, I actually have a better example since PC Magazine did the transition.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.880]   >> Right.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.480]   >> They stopped saying.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.080]   >> I can tell you that a lot of people aren't too pleased.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.320]   >> Are they, is their circulation down?
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.280]   >> I don't know what the surf figures are, I mean I'm sure the shirt is somewhat.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.000]   >> I mean it's apples to oranges because people don't read the website the way they
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.960]   would read the magazine.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.960]   >> No, no, but no, no, you're, this is kind of more in line with the Kindle thinking.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.080]   Because they have a version of the magazine that which wants the magazine now done
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.880]   with Zinnio.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.760]   >> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.040]   You download it, yeah, I've looked at the Zinnio version.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.120]   >> Most people.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.440]   >> Who wants that?
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.480]   >> Well, you know, the only guy that was really into it was years ago when
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.440]   Michael Miller was at PC Magazine, he used to carry around a note, note, one of those
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.200]   notebook computers, notepad computers, a big one.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.360]   Which you know, whatever happened to those?
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.200]   They were supposed to take over, weren't they?
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.840]   But anyway, he used to have one and he used to love Zinnio because he'd had the
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.120]   magazine and he flipped the pages.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.440]   You know, he'd have, the whole thing was one page, so it kind of worked out.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.240]   But I find it inconvenient personally.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.920]   And a lot of people say, hey, you know, I like to read the thing casually, maybe
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.720]   when I'm going to bed or when I'm on the train or if I'm in my car.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.320]   >> I like paper.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.240]   >> Doctor's office, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.000]   >> I like, I really like paper and I really like being able to hand something
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.280]   off to somebody.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:39.840]   >> Yes.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.880]   >> If I'm on the train and I'm done with the sports section, I can give it to the
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.760]   guy next to me.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.840]   I can leave it behind when I'm done.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.800]   >> In fact, that's a big problem with the copy protection on the Kindle.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.280]   You can't give it to somebody else.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.640]   >> I want to like the Kindle so much.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.720]   I really, I want to love it and I see the potential in it.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.400]   But that is a huge drawback for me.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.160]   >> However, I guess my point is it's not really going to be up to the customers if
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.000]   the company, I mean, the times could go bankrupt this year.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.880]   Their operating costs are so through the roof, their revenue is so down thanks to
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.280]   Craigslist and other things that competition from the internet that they may not have a
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:17.680]   choice.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.000]   It's not like they're saying the customer's demanding it.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.200]   They're not saying that.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:29.320]   I wonder if a paper like The Times with looking back over the last, like look back at them
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   during the Bush years.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:37.160]   If you look back at all those front page columns, Judith Miller wrote that we all knew they
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.280]   were wrong and based on crap at the time.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:49.000]   But now they're like, it's really clear, like the front page of The New York Times was
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.880]   not a reliable trustworthy news source for a long time.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   >> That hurt him, too.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   >> And I wonder how much a lack of confidence.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.120]   I'm about halfway through this fascinating book by Farad Manju called True Enough.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:07.960]   And it's all about how you stick yourself in an echo chamber and how it's this wonderful
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   book about how the like can get around the world several times before the truth puts its
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   shoe on.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.480]   It's tie-in shoes.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.800]   And I wonder how much old media, print media, whatever have hurt themselves.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   >> Well, wait a minute.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.160]   If that's true in print media, it's true in spades on the internet.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.480]   >> Absolutely, it totally is.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:34.080]   But I guess I wonder if it's a question of, there's a topic in delicious about The Times
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.720]   blaming the internet for really messing up a story about Caroline Kennedy.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.160]   >> And The Times, by the way.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.240]   Yeah, you said it.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.320]   They blame the internet.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   >> It's not our fault.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   >> We didn't screw up.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:49.000]   >> The thing is, you could say the same thing about cable news.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Like in that way.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   >> They made us do it.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.400]   They made us do it.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.320]   >> We wanted to be first with the story.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.080]   In fact, checking be damned.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:02.760]   I just think the day when you can't rely on journalists to tell the truth instead of
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:12.080]   this like wussy irresponsible, he said she said kind of thing, is when that you start
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   looking elsewhere to get your news and information.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.600]   >> So John, what is the experience of PC Magazine?
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.880]   Was this a right move for them?
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   Was it the wrong thing?
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.600]   >> Again, it was like the New York Times.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.640]   >> It didn't have a choice.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.720]   You have to do it, you have to do it because advertisers want something one way or the
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.720]   other.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.440]   And the fact of the matter, and I've written about this in one of my online columns, which
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.960]   is the advertisers, the big boys, the Intel's, the AMD's, the Dell's, everybody in between
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.880]   the Sony Panasonic.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.600]   They didn't want to advertise in these magazines anymore.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.400]   And then PC Magazine was the only one.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.800]   If you wanted to see a real sorry situation, go take a look at a copy of Computer World
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.480]   if you can find one.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.600]   It's about a eight page, kind of a thing on a small format.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.960]   And it's like whatever happened to the old Computer World, which was a big giant newspaper.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.160]   And it's because these advertisers, and a lot of it has to do with the advertising business
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.960]   itself has been slightly skewed.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:12.280]   They brought over the years, starting around the late 1980s, probably got it, he had a
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.080]   steam in the 1990s.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   They started to shift to using media buyers for most of the placements for the big companies,
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.320]   a company to get pretty big, and then they'd hire a big ad agency, and the ad agency would
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.160]   have a quote unquote media buyer who you'd have to actually take a side because they
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.520]   didn't know anything about the industries that they were placing advertising.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.640]   And they were all 20 something, generally speaking, women from Smith.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.960]   Oh, Smith.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:47.560]   Well, there were these, you know, Ivy League girls from these colleges in the back east,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.000]   and they were all working out in New York.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.280]   They didn't know any about computers, but they were given the Dell account, for example,
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.400]   and they would place, and usually in magazines that they maybe have heard of, or somebody
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.200]   who had a, usually to be honest about it, it was the companies like Forbes that generally
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.640]   gave it the best parties.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.760]   Forbes would put everybody, I've been on a couple of these things.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.360]   You get on that big Highlander, that big yacht that they keep in the New York Harbor,
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.080]   and they loaded up with all these media buyers, and they'd give them a variety, a couple of
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.720]   rides around the island, and it's like, and they'd feed the best wine and food, and the
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.200]   next thing you know, they're taking ads out and put them in Forbes.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   It's kind of corrupted, though.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.080]   So if I got a yacht, you think I could sell more ads?
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.640]   It's a big yacht we're talking about here, not a, you know,
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.000]   dingy, I could afford a dingy, I could take some advertisers out in the Petaluma River
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   in my dingy.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.600]   That might work.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   No.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   No.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.800]   Just wear that nice captain's hat that you have.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.360]   I'll give them summer sausage.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.840]   So anyway, so the magazines, the whole thing shifted, and then, you know, the online thing
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.160]   kind of, you know, sucked what they could away, and I don't know.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.880]   That's what she said.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.400]   Let's actually, I got one more, I got one more dumb internet trick.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.120]   This is from the Maryland, they don't call it the legislature.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.600]   They call it the General Assembly.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.880]   They've got some weird colonial notion of democracy.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.560]   The Maryland General Assembly's IT department has decided that Facebook and MySpace are
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:20.200]   laden with viruses, and so they've, they're blocking it now to all government offices,
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.560]   the General Assembly computers, lawmakers and staff.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   They can't go to Facebook or MySpace, which is kind of a problem, because like the governor's
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:35.200]   got a Facebook page, many of the state's senators and they call them delegates have
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.080]   Facebook pages that they communicate with constituents, but you know, they're loaded with,
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.080]   with spyware.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.840]   So do they, do they know what loaded with viruses?
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.320]   I think they do.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.120]   We're scared and we're turning off the internet.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.080]   It's scary out there.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.920]   It's bad stuff.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.360]   It's just crazy.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.920]   By the way, the legislators are not happy about it.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.600]   There's got to be a different reason for that.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.040]   No, that's what they said.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.200]   Well, that's what they said, but come on.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.320]   But they're only blocking Facebook and MySpace.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.320]   Right.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   That's why it's got to be a different reason.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.760]   If they're only blocking Facebook and MySpace, they're not blocking Twitter, they're not blocking
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   FARC.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.000]   Because they don't know about Twitter and FARC.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.200]   They don't get it.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.440]   They're idiots.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.760]   Yeah, black FARC.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.840]   No, don't block FARC.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.640]   That's where all the, that's where all the viruses are.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.560]   Now, blue kurt is a friend.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   I would never.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.000]   True is also a friend of mine.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.560]   Never block FARC.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:40.160]   Actually Leo, if you want to talk to somebody about online advertising and how bad news has
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.680]   gotten screwed up, you should talk to Drew.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.680]   How so?
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   What's his, I will get him on.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   I love you.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.120]   Drew has a fantastic book.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.000]   We call it, it's called the FARC book.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.320]   The book is called It's Not News, It's FARC, How Mass Media Tries to Pass Off Crap as News.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.320]   And it's hilarious.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:02.240]   It's based on these years of running FARC and looking at news stories every single day
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.080]   and picking out patterns out of the noise.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:11.760]   And then watching advertising and see how advertising is changing and how the actual results
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:19.400]   of advertising because you can track them so clearly online are so divorced from what
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.200]   advertisers have always wanted them to really be.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   Interesting.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.280]   Yeah, it's fascinating to sit and listen to Drew talk about this stuff.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.240]   And I thought he was peddling boobies.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.040]   Little did I know.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.400]   He manages to sneak some boobies in beer in there among the other things.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.880]   The news story.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   And God bless him for that.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.640]   I think Lisa was going to say something.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.440]   She got stoned on.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.440]   Lisa, go ahead.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.760]   I was just, you know, where they're talking about how Facebook, they're opening the API
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.480]   so that I'm excited about that.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.960]   In fact, some say this is good.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.920]   Who said that Mark Cantor, not that he's the bastion of credibility, but Mark Cantor said
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.400]   that it's that his Simon at the when when Facebook announced their status page API that
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.120]   it reduced the value of Twitter by one half.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.400]   So you think so, Lisa, you think people would use Facebook instead of Twitter?
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.560]   Oh gosh, I don't know.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:20.520]   It's such a thing I don't like about Facebook is there's always it feels like they're selling
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   this information.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   They're gathering all this.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.480]   It does feel like that, doesn't it?
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.080]   It feels a bit scary to me.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.880]   And I felt that, you know, right at the beginning, I was really apprehensive about it, but it's
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:36.160]   sort of such a you think more than Twitter is Twitter doesn't have access to any of the
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.160]   information that faces.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   I guess not.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   That's true.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   You tell it.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.560]   You're not telling them, you know, your marital status.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.240]   You know, you're like where you were.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.200]   And we be with beak and Facebook basically said, yeah, we'll use it.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.400]   And then there's advertising on the side that's sort of, you know, geared towards.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.760]   Yeah, it says Lisa Bettany.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.360]   Lisa Bettany is downloading this software.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.360]   Shouldn't you?
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.960]   Yeah, it's kind of a ball.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.960]   It's kind of a ball.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   Yeah, it is.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   And I think.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   But so here's the deal.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.040]   So here's what what Facebook's basically said is you could make a Twitter like page that
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.360]   is a using our API that is Facebook statuses.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.200]   All the people I care about are my friends on Facebook.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.120]   Wouldn't I just do that instead of using Twitter?
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:24.680]   Well, I mean, I mean, Twitter is more than just a status update.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.680]   I mean, people use it.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.720]   Well, I use my Facebook status that way.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.200]   I mean, I actually pipe my Twitter into Facebook.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   Right.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.800]   So we're going from Twitter to Facebook rather than the other way around.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.200]   I mean, can you imagine?
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.720]   We're getting enough nom, nom, noms to just go nuts.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.960]   You know, you do hate this 25 things.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.040]   You don't know about me, meme.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.040]   Do you hate this?
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   I hate this so much.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   I don't do memes.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   Period.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.040]   I've never done it.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.240]   I don't have any.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.640]   I did it for my market watch column this weekend.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.880]   You actually did it.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.640]   You did 25 things you don't know about me.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.080]   No, I did 25 things you didn't know about the tech scene in computers.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   Well, see, that's OK.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.920]   Well, I don't know how OK it was.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.520]   I didn't have anything else to write about.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.400]   So I figured, well, this is an interesting meme.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.800]   Let me just do this.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.640]   And it turns out they get more views than anything.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.280]   So what can you say?
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   Nom, nom, nom.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   Nom, nom.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.240]   Did you do a Facebook page 25 things you don't know about me?
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   Will Wheaton?
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.400]   No, I did not.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.040]   I don't trust Facebook at all.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.320]   Oh, you feel the same way?
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.520]   I trust Facebook less than I trust Google.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.200]   And I think that the day is coming.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   Maybe not right away.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.400]   But I really believe the day is eventually coming where Facebook takes all of that user
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.920]   data that they've been aggregating for years and years and sells it somewhere.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.720]   And bad things happen to the people that are that are the subject of that data collection.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.400]   I just I don't.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.880]   I tried to play around Facebook a little bit for a little while.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.760]   And I just didn't like how it said, OK, well, if you want to do this, you're granting the
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.920]   developer access to every single bit of information about you.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.000]   I don't know why I need that.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.400]   If I'm going to play Scrabble, I don't see what the point is.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.720]   Oh, will you reading between your your think?
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.600]   This is not possible.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.200]   Why would anybody want to do anything?
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   See, I'm I am.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.600]   I don't know.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.680]   Why would anyone want to have access to crazy amounts of data about individuals and be able
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:25.280]   to attach that data to like surfing habits and web page visits and and and and and purchases
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.320]   and things like I can't imagine what what what anyone would want to do with that information.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:34.640]   I understand why Facebook is worth what is it 50 billion 15 billion dollars, you know,
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:40.720]   but I really find this implication that this opening of the API is going to kill Twitter.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:50.040]   One of the most ridiculous uses of of stupid hyperbole that I've heard online in a very,
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.840]   very, very long time.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.400]   I mean, there's here's how you here's how you use Twitter.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.560]   You spend about 30 seconds to sign up and you're done and then you go and to like to do Facebook,
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.560]   you got to sign up.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.920]   You got to give them all your information.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.800]   Then you got to go through and set up all the privacy settings so that they're not just,
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.120]   you know, broadcasting everything about you to everyone that can find you there.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:19.560]   And I don't see how this kills Twitter or or even even makes a dent in in in what makes
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.600]   Twitter cool.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   I agree next topic.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.800]   We haven't done chewing this topic, John.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   We got to chew some.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.720]   No, it's true to too much shoe more on this.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.120]   I can always tell when the topics running out of steam with will because he when he instead
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:39.600]   of saying very, he says very, very, very, and when he gets the three verys in a row,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.440]   he's going to tell you say this script.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.440]   I'm counting.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.440]   He's going to tell.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.920]   And I know he's stalling for any once you to move to the next topic.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.120]   I am so glad you John.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.520]   I am very, very, very glad you're here.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.520]   You're glad you don't play poker with him.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.040]   He spotted your tell.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.560]   Well, look at Robert Scobble's calling in to tell us how important Facebook actually
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.040]   he's not a Facebook fantasy.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.440]   He's in our chatroom right now.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   Fatal air.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440]   Is it the real Robert Scobble?
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.000]   Of course, it's the real Robert Scobble.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Scobble.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   So what about was the act taking this job?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   That's a dumb story.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.320]   Do you even care about that story?
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.320]   Fusion.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.320]   I owe.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   Why is working for a living fusion?
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.000]   I owe is a solid state enterprise hardware drive, a hard drive maker.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.080]   Very, very fast, very, very, very expensive.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   And was is now their chief technical officer.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.040]   See Robert's calling me on the cell phone.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.040]   Hold on a second.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.200]   See Robert, you're supposed to call on Skype.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   He doesn't need it.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   Not a you Skype.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   All right.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   All right.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.600]   Damn that Robert Scobble.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   Someone should teach him how to use technology.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.120]   He doesn't know how to use the internet.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.120]   That's the problem.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.600]   Hey, hold on a second.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   I got no negative.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.600]   Yeah, that's a Scobble.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.600]   There it comes.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.600]   Here it comes.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   Here comes a Scobble.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.600]   All over the Scobble.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   All right.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:59.160]   While Scobble is getting his headset, let me pause for a moment and regale you with a

[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   I love that book.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.840]   I can't wait to read it.

[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   Hey.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   Hey.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.120]   I don't know what's going on with you, Robert.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:49.520]   I think I think Robert is contacting us via shortwave radio from like Antarctica or something
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520]   like that.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.520]   I am her.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.840]   I don't know what you're gating out or something, Robert.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.280]   Are you going to get on a headset?
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.560]   We only hear the first syllable of every word.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.560]   It is.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.560]   He's kind of like he's on the moon.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.200]   I'm just going to hang up because I can't.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   I can't.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   I can't deal with that.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   I can't live with that man.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   Cut that off.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   I can't take it.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.200]   What does he want is the question.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.200]   I don't know.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   We'll never find out now.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.000]   We only heard the first syllable of each word.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Maybe he wants help.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Help me.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Help me.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   I can't make Skype work.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.960]   I'm sure he had something.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.120]   Now the Kindle, the new Kindle is supposed to come out tomorrow.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   We'll see Monday.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.000]   And I think it's pretty credible because the pictures you're seeing are very professional.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   I mean, they're not.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.960]   These are no, uh, these are no Photoshop pictures of the new Kindle and it doesn't look, I mean,
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   awesomely better.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.200]   It's got a nice metal back.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.240]   They've changed the form factor.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   The buttons aren't so big.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.560]   So you don't accidentally turn the page.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.760]   I'm a Kindle fanatic though.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.600]   See, I really, I read everything on the Kindle if I can.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.880]   I first listen, see if I can get it on Audible, I listen, then I, then I, if I can't get
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.520]   it on the Kindle and papers the last resort because I really like the idea of having lots
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.160]   of books in this little form factor.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.520]   How often have you been using your original Kindle?
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.920]   Well, I don't have the new one.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.360]   So I have to use the original.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   But you know, how often?
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.400]   Oh, that's what I read on all the every night.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   Everything.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   You get the New York Times on it.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   I love this.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   You subscribe to the New York Times on it.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.440]   You get it at three in the morning that not that morning automatically just comes in.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.000]   You get a bunch of newspapers that way.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.800]   It's not quite like reading the paper New York Times, but there are no ads.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.120]   Not, I think not all the contents there, like the crossword puzzle is not there, but it
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.680]   wouldn't make sense because you'd draw on the screen and you'd ruin the Kindle.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.320]   So, but otherwise I think it's great.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.360]   You know, I got a chess book on the Kindle and you actually get the diagrams.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   You can act.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   It's really kind of cool.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.200]   It's like I had 600 positions in it and I could just look at them one by one.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.480]   Oh, I have a similar book.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.400]   What's that?
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   It's about chess.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.760]   That's what she said.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   Thank you.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.760]   Thank you.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.320]   Come back to 10 PS.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   That was easy.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.320]   We wanted a hack that was easy button, you know, the staples button.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.320]   To say stuff.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.320]   And it's actually not that hard.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.880]   The chip is easy to hack.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.880]   Never got around to it.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.080]   It was kind of an idea.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.080]   We had.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.360]   This seems like something that the guys that make would have already done.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.360]   I guarantee you they have.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.520]   So, they took a lot of the fun out of these kinds of things.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.240]   Like, yeah, make probably already did.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.720]   Yes, John.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.320]   The guitar hero, a 14 year old Texan said something worth.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   Love this kid.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.400]   Have you seen this video?
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.120]   Now, cue it up.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.360]   Yeah, I have not.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.360]   All right.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.920]   I mean, I'm familiar with the familiar with the song.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.160]   I'm familiar with.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.160]   Are you?
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.200]   Because it's like some sort of heavy metal thing that I don't know.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:39.040]   It's actually not even fire and flames on guitar hero is kind of like green grass and high tides
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.240]   on rock band.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.680]   It's not a song that you play.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   It's a song that you endure.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.960]   It's a song that you survive.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   Well, get ready.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.960]   Get ready to endure.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.200]   Because here we go.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:55.320]   This is a young Danny Johnston, 14 years old of great vine, Texas, who set the new world
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.520]   record of guitar hero three, nine hundred seventy three thousand points playing dragon
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.080]   forces through the fire and flame.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.120]   Just take a listen to how good this is.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.120]   I'm going to have 15.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.120]   How fun playing.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:13.560]   You know what I really love about guitar hero is the slapping sound on the on the little
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.720]   plastic guitar really enhances the music.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.240]   Of course, he's talking.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.320]   He's not even looking at the terrible.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   He's talking.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.320]   He's talking.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.320]   He's playing.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.320]   But you know what?
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.320]   He's really good.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   I mean, I have to say, if you watch this whole thing.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.560]   Somebody in the chat room said this kid will never have a girlfriend.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.760]   Are you really kidding?
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:45.800]   Any girl who sees what this kid can do with his fingers without even looking?
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.200]   He's not even looking.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.520]   He's talking with his buddies.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.640]   But you know, you think he probably does have kind of sweaty hands.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.320]   And to get that proficient, he's probably not working on other areas of his life.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.560]   Lisa, you're a girl.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.640]   Do you find that, you know, hot?
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:10.520]   Honestly, no, no, you know, it's really sad if this kid put that much effort into
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.400]   actually playing a guitar.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   Yeah, probably.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.760]   You pretty damn good.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.040]   Listen, I've got to disagree with that.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.400]   I love Guitar Hero.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   I love rock band.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.040]   I am a former bass player.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.320]   I've played a little bit of drums in my life, a little bit of, you know, pick up and learn
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:30.640]   the tab for the solo in Stairway to Heaven, that level of guitar playing.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.160]   I absolutely love rock band.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.240]   I absolutely love Guitar Hero because I'm not an actual musician.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.000]   And I can feel like one.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   It does feel that way, isn't it?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:46.120]   When I play these songs and the point of this, of things like this, is not to be a musician,
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.560]   it's to pretend to be a musician and get together with your friends in goof off.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:56.600]   But if he played a guitar at the same amount of time, he would be a musician.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.720]   Well, yeah, he would.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:03.120]   What he's doing in this, what he's doing with fire and flames, it's not, it's nothing
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.160]   like playing music.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.040]   It's like learning a pattern.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.440]   He has more in common with Billy Mitchell than Billy Corrigan.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.960]   I think it's, I think the time is better spent playing strip poker.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.520]   Wait, I'm sorry.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.120]   Dejondivore, I just say he wants to play strip poker with this 14 year old Guitar Hero.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:24.920]   What's really sad is if you don't know any girls strip poker, it really isn't much fun.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.920]   That's sadly true.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   It is.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   I've tried.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.920]   No fun.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.840]   So how are you liking the Wii?
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.840]   You got a Wii.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.840]   I got a Wii.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.840]   It's so stupid.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:40.120]   Because every time I get on this show and slam the Wii, I get email from people who say,
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.320]   you're not a gamer, man.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.320]   If you were a gamer, you would love the Wii.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.760]   The Wii is great.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.560]   And I said, okay, okay, I'm getting a Wii.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.000]   I know somebody said, welcome to 2006.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Thank you.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.920]   I know, I know, you know, it's a little late.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.840]   I got all the, you know, I got, I got Wii Fit.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.880]   I got, I got, you know, I played tennis.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.600]   I played bowling.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.520]   You know, if it has the lifespan of a, of a Mayfly.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.880]   I mean, it's like after, you know, it's, what do you think?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.840]   Well, you're the actual, you're an actual gamer.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.960]   Well, I just wanted to thank my fellow gamers for being elitist, synopsis, and insulting
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.240]   you for not liking to play with a console because nothing makes people want to engage
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.520]   in a hobby quite like dealing with members of the hobby that are elitist dicks about
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   the whole thing.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.920]   I know I have a PlayStation 3 love it.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.400]   I have an Xbox 360 love it even more.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.440]   I just feel like the Wii is for people who really don't like video games.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.440]   It just, you know, want to.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.040]   You know, I have a Wii and I have a 360.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.320]   I use my 360 more than anything else.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.320]   Of course you do.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.480]   But I really like the Wii.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.880]   I love Wii, love, love, love Wii Sports.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:48.240]   Wii Sports with my wife and my kids and some of my friends getting together and playing
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.240]   tennis and boxing.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.000]   How many years have you been doing this?
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.080]   I got mine toward the beginning of 2007.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   Okay.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.360]   So you've been doing a long time and you still haven't, it hasn't paled.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   Well, no.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.960]   I mean, but it's not something that I use every day.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:07.720]   I get on my 360 about every other day depending on, you know, what games I'm playing.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.040]   But I don't really play the Wii as much as I once did.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:17.760]   I really like all the other things that the Wii offers, the internet channel and the weather.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.760]   I like sitting there making me.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   It also has a...
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   I do too.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   I have 180 Me's.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.260]   We have me parades every night.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.760]   So my daughter showed me this thing.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.320]   It does where you can, you take part in a giant worldwide survey.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.720]   Yeah, that's pretty fun.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.160]   And then you try to guess if your answer is the right one.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.440]   Yeah, that would be fun.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.440]   Yeah, that's pretty fun.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.640]   And I love the virtual console too for the old NES games.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.760]   I can play Excite Bike again and the original Legend of Zelda and things like that.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:50.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, Will Wheaton on Rock Band doing a little Bon Jovi number.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   Oh yeah.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.600]   In front of a crowd, that's brave.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.680]   We had a huge rock band party at the Phoenix Comic.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.840]   And he played for about two hours.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   This is very brave.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   It was awesome.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   It was so much fun.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   And you're singing, though.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.840]   You're not gonna...
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.840]   You're not gonna...
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.840]   You may love me.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   You know, you're right.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:19.680]   What this gives you is the chance to be a rock star without any skill.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.480]   It's all about pretending.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.240]   And you're doing a good job pretending.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.240]   Thank you.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.320]   Well, as a matter of fact, I am good at pretending.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.080]   He's got the arms, the kimbo.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.000]   He's got the serious look.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.440]   He wouldn't get the fiber collection.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.640]   That's really good.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.200]   That's well done.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:47.040]   Apparently, there are quite a few videos of you on YouTube.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.040]   There are.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.120]   Hey, here's an interesting fun fact from E. Wooding on Twitter.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   Yes.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.720]   This guy at replied me and he said the kid from the guitar hero video plays five instruments
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.120]   according to the New York Times.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.520]   Oh, there goes the whole theory.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.440]   The BBC presents the day of the trip.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   I don't know.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   Please.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.440]   I don't know.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   I don't know.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.000]   I just lost my concentration there for a moment.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.280]   Laps into BBC.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.360]   Well, that's he plays four instruments.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.360]   Okay, see, that's cool.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.360]   That's five.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.360]   It's your five.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.360]   Okay, never mind.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.360]   I'm wrong once again.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.480]   I'm actually looking at my Wii Fit.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.640]   It's currently covered in the mound of DVDs.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.040]   Oh, come on.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.200]   You did the hula hoop thing.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.200]   Come on, admit it.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.360]   I'm really, really good at the hula hoop.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.360]   I knew it.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   Still?
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.160]   Yeah, I actually just got Call of Duty World at War.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.600]   We want a video.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   I'm hopeless.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.040]   Honestly, I'm the most hopeless.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.760]   I am not a Veronica Belmont.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   I cannot.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.080]   I'm, I got locked in this, this hut.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.320]   I couldn't get out of this hut and my, I got shot.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.640]   You got locked in a hut?
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.440]   Yeah, I just, I walked into a hut and I couldn't get out of it.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.440]   You just got stuck.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   I got stuck.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.440]   What is he talking about?
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.560]   That's kind of how I played Call of Duty 4.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.440]   I'm the, I'm the guy who's like facing the corner and you come up behind him and just
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.160]   shoot him for fun and I get up.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.160]   I'm still facing the corner.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.160]   I can't figure out how to turn around.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.400]   You shoot me again.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   That's pretty much it.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.680]   It's difficult with the Wii because I don't know the, the way you hold the, the remote
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.840]   and it just doesn't feel natural somehow.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.400]   All right, coming up, we're going to talk about the, the greatest Google street view
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.560]   hack ever.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.240]   We're going to talk about digital piracy and.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.240]   We're going to talk about latitude while we're talking about it.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.960]   Yeah, we got to talk about Google latitude and we're going to, I'm afraid we're going
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.600]   to have to let Mr. Wil Wheaton go because he has an actual date with an actual woman.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.800]   I'm so weird.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   So cool.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.040]   And we're never, we're never having Will on again because he's shown me up.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.360]   He's, he's shown me not to be a good gamer, not to be a musician, nothing.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   I'm a loser.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.160]   And don't do anything.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.480]   I don't do nothing but sit on a ball and talk.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   Will you're the greatest.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.480]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   I really appreciate it.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.320]   It's really awesome to be with all of you.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.160]   And I really hope that I can come back and do this.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.320]   Come back and well, just remember that when you do twit, you really got to allocate three
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.840]   or four hours of your life to it.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.720]   Well, for, for the future, I will be certain to do that.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.440]   I won't go scheduling any dates on the same day.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.440]   Shocked.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.520]   That's great to talk to you.

[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   Any acting coming up?
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.480]   What the hell is going on?
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.480]   Who is that?
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.800]   Is that you?
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   What?
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   John.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   John C. de Vorac.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   Are you acting out?
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.240]   Please agree with me that that was awesome.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.240]   It was awesome.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.640]   It was totally awesome.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.640]   It was totally awesome.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:58.280]   OMG, that'd be so awesome.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.080]   What show is that?
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.880]   Family Guy.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.320]   Is that you will on that or is it just so random?
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.560]   I'm actually I'm on Family Guy.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.760]   Pretty soon we did a Star Trek episode.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.160]   That's really, really, really funny.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.160]   Are you on it?
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.160]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.160]   That would be awesome to see.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.160]   Awesome.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   There we go again.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   You want me to go through the series?
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.160]   No, stop.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.160]   Thank you, Will.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.160]   Go have a date.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.160]   All right.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.160]   A good talk, do it, Will.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.160]   I hope you get lucky.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.160]   Yeah, you too.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.160]   I'll see you guys.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   Bye.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.160]   Bye.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.160]   That was easy.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.160]   All right.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.880]   Now it's just the three of us.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.880]   Good.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.360]   He's gone.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.360]   John.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.480]   Make it look like a poster.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.120]   An actual gamer.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.960]   Last time I ever had one of them on.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.160]   Why don't we get an echo?
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.520]   I'm getting an echo from you, John.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.920]   Why am I getting an echo from you?
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   You show them because I probably crank the thing up to give you the...
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.920]   Or I don't know why.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.920]   Crank it down.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:57.560]   Now I was trying to queue up those sound effects earlier because I just kept missing his awesome,
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   saying awesome.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.560]   He said it about eight times.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.560]   So...
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   What is it?
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.040]   It's from a family guy who he was on before.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:11.520]   Yeah, this was a family guy where Meg works at the little 7/11 place and then her brother
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.440]   works there and then she gets fired because these two guys just keep saying awesome to
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   each other.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.440]   That was a good episode.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.440]   I enjoyed that episode.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.440]   It was a great one.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   Great episode.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   I'm going to get some news.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.440]   All right, we're going to get some news on.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:27.120]   I'm going to take a break while we get scoble on the line.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.040]   He says he's ready now for us.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.840]   Meanwhile, see what next time we're going to do with Robert, we're going to use GoToMyPC
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.400]   and we'll get him all set up ahead of time.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.400]   That's what I should have done.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.480]   GoToMyPC allows you to access your PC anywhere.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:45.000]   Now, you might have used remote access products before and perhaps you've had a bad experience
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   with the free ones.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   They're slow.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   They're hard to use.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.560]   You've got to configure the router, punch holes in the firewall.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.040]   Not go to my PC.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.040]   It's fast.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.280]   It's easy to set up in a couple of minutes.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:54:00.200]   In fact, if you go right now to go to myPC.com/twit, before I'm done talking, you will have installed
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   it.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.800]   By the way, it'll be free for the first 30 days, unlimited use.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.240]   I recommend you do that just to get an idea of what you could do.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.000]   As an example, you're in an internet cafe and you're in somewhere, it's complete sketch.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.040]   You're down a back alley and you're in Bangkok.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.400]   You don't know what's going on and you want to access your office.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.720]   If you want to surf the net, you've got to get your email.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.480]   You go in there, you log on with your secure username and password.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.200]   Boom, 128-bit SSL encryption.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:30.360]   You are safe, except for that guy behind you with a knife, but you are safe.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.800]   That's the idea with GoToMyPC.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.600]   It's 128-bit encrypted connection to your office.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   You sit there.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   It opens up.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   It's just like you're there full screen.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:40.600]   You send and receive email.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   You run any program.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.440]   Of course, you can even drag and drop files.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.640]   No matter where you are, anytime, as long as you get online, you can get to your office
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.920]   computer and that's the beauty of GoToMyPC.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.960]   PC World gave it their world class award for best remote access software.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:58.120]   From the folks at Citrix, I mean, these guys, they wrote this stuff.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.960]   They created the stuff in Windows.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.960]   They know how this stuff works.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.960]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.480]   What are you laughing at me?
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.480]   You are.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:08.480]   I hear you sniggering.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.480]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.480]   John, that's not nice.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.480]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.640]   Do I come on your show and laugh at you?
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   Go to...
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   Yes, actually, I do.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.360]   Go to myPC.com/twit.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.360]   Try it today.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.360]   Absolutely free.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.240]   I know you're going to love it.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:28.760]   For those of you who don't like, back to my Mac.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:32.920]   Have you ever gotten back to my Mac work to work once?
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   Not very well.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.960]   I've never been able to access a Mac using back to my Mac.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:41.200]   You'd think that Apple would know this and would try to fix it, but it's been that
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.680]   way for a year and a half.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.200]   And now I can't get on a mobile me.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.640]   It's just like they don't...
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.680]   Yeah, it doesn't work.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.160]   We can't figure it out.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.720]   They just gave up on it.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.040]   Robert Scobble, let me hear you.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.400]   Hey, does it sound better?
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.640]   I hear every word.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   Excellent.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   That was weird.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.640]   It was like you...
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.000]   It sounds like he's in a bucket a little bit, but it's okay.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.680]   I'm on a new Mac now.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.560]   Oh, the bucket Mac.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.240]   You know, I noticed something.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.160]   Maybe you've noticed this.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.840]   I don't normally on Twitter follow everybody who follows me because on Twitter you want
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:22.800]   to put together a list of people that you're interested in who say interesting things.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   But I have one account, Twit Live, which we use to say, we're broadcasting now.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   And I turned on...
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   I asked the Twitter folks, "Turn that on that I follow everybody who follows me."
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:37.560]   But lately I've been looking at almost every follow when I follow them responds with, "Thanks
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.840]   for following me.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.080]   Now get my free wealth creation guide at gotowealthcreation.com."
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.680]   Every one of them is spam.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:49.160]   Everyone out of 20 follows 19 are spam, John.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.840]   I'm getting the same thing, but a lot of people are now using a tool called Social2.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.360]   Social2 doing it.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.880]   Yeah, and you can set it to auto respond to people like that.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.320]   Yeah, that's why I'm getting the under response.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:04.440]   It makes me think that all of this massive growth in Twitter is just bogus.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:10.800]   I'd say some of it is not bogus because I'm actually seeing real people on my tweet
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.800]   deck.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   Well, I see a real...
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.760]   But you don't still follow everybody.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.760]   I do now.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:21.560]   I really hate that I had to turn it on, but a lot of people are asking, "Are trying to
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:26.280]   direct message me with news tips and business stuff?"
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.040]   Hey, there's this thing now they got called email.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.480]   It's really cool where somebody can send you a message.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.280]   Don't use it, Leo.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.720]   No, my sister reads it for me.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.800]   And of course, Lisa doesn't either.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.760]   What do you do?
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   We all gave up an email.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.040]   I get 100 messages an hour.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.960]   I can't answer all that.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.160]   You must be getting a lot of spam.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.360]   No, that's not the spam.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.280]   Why don't you just go by the subject?
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.880]   I get about 100 emails a day or so, and I don't look at all of them.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.040]   I just look at the subject line.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.240]   By the way, this is a tip for anybody.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.400]   Make it the subject line compelling.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.560]   You can tell if it's important.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.920]   I tried to get people not to send me direct messages.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.120]   I pleaded with them.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.920]   Don't send me direct messages when they did anyway, and then they get pissed because they
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:08.920]   can't direct message.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:12.760]   Yeah, because you can't direct message somebody who's not following you.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.760]   I was really hurt.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:19.080]   I was really hurt because Sarah Myers of Pop 17 sent me a direct message saying, "Hi,
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   Leo."
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.080]   So I just responded, "Hi, back."
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.520]   And it says, "Sarah's not following you.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.240]   You lose her."
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.160]   I could say, "I know how people feel when you say..."
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   Somebody said they sent you a note back saying that?
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.360]   No, Twitter does that automatically.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.720]   You can't direct message somebody who's not following you, which is a good thing because
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.000]   it keeps people from spamming you.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.040]   It also keeps you from interacting with jerks, by the way, because on Tweet-Tec, I see anybody
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.800]   who says, "I'm a f***ing person."
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.200]   And if I try to call them a f***ing back, it doesn't let me do it because they're not
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.200]   following me.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:57.680]   You shouldn't have that as a search term, though, because I find if you do have a search term,
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.840]   you're going to get a lot of those messages.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:05.440]   Which brings us to another topic, which people might be interested in, which is cursebird.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.440]   What is cursebird?
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.440]   I don't know that.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.440]   C-U-R-S-E-B-I-R-D.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.600]   Bird, bird, bird, bird is the word.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:18.000]   It's essentially a Ajax page.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.160]   And it throws every Tweet that goes into the system that has a cussword in it, gets posted.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.840]   And you can look yourself up.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.160]   And I looked you up, Leo.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.160]   And do I swear a lot?
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.080]   No, you have a zero rating.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.080]   Yeah, baby.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.080]   And me too.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.080]   I have a zero rating.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:38.040]   I have not cursed on Twitter, and I don't intend to.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.040]   And I think it's...
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.040]   And you're watching...
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:45.840]   So the game that we started to play, actually, Adam Curry and I developed this.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.560]   You look for people that you think are kind of interesting, but you see them cussing like
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.160]   a truck driver.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   And then you...
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.640]   And for men, you do women and women do men.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.760]   And then you click on their page to see what they look like and see what some of their
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:57.760]   posts are.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:04.440]   And then you decide, and the name of the game is, "Is this person a psycho?"
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.520]   So I'll tell you what I did.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.120]   I don't curse on Twitter.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.120]   I try not to curse on the show.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:12.600]   In fact, you probably heard a bleep storm a minute ago because of a word that we were
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.680]   saying that we bleeped out.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.640]   But so we try to keep it family-friendly.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640]   Did I get bleeped?
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.640]   Oh, man.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.680]   But you don't get bleeped in a livestream because I'm not that fast.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.600]   So everybody listening live got...
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.520]   That's why you listen live so you can hear your scoble curse.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.520]   But I was okay.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.120]   About Friday, I do every Friday morning.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:39.880]   I do a little tech bit with the Morning Man in Los Angeles on KFI, Bill Handel.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.880]   Number one show in LA.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880]   It's a great show.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.200]   Bill is a little porn obsessed.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.360]   So I'm talking about Twitter and I'm saying Twitter really has gone mainstream.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:51.040]   A lot of movie stars, a lot of well-known people, every presenter in Britain is now
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   on Twitter.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.400]   Stephen Fry is massive on Twitter.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.200]   And I said, "And even porn stars are on Twitter."
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.200]   No.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.560]   I mean, I didn't know this, but practically the whole porn community is using.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.640]   But the funny thing is their tweets are the most mundane, boring things you ever saw.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.360]   I mean, they're worse than normal.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.360]   They don't curse.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   They're really boring.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.320]   But anyway, so I said that.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.680]   And then I thought, "Well, I probably should back this up."
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.520]   So I went on Twitter.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.960]   So you put up a website with all the porn stars listed.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.960]   I did.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.120]   I went on Twitter and I said, "Hi KFI listeners.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.120]   Thanks for following me."
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.480]   I mentioned, "Here's a list of celebrities on Twitter.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   Here's a list of porn stars on Twitter."
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.640]   I got this email.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:39.400]   A quick note to let you know that your reputation in our home has significantly gone down there.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:44.160]   Thanks to your recent Twitter concerning porn stars who er, twit.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:49.040]   My husband and I have just gone through a recovery of his leftover bad internet habits
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.240]   from adolescents.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.040]   To put it mildly, we just got married.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.680]   He used to follow your Twitter, but that's not happening anymore.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.240]   Nor is his subscription to your podcast continuing.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.720]   Now both of our choices, not just mine, by the way.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.840]   Can you just start reading that again, but do it in one of your voices?
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.200]   If you want to keep up, I'll do a droopy dog.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.760]   If you want to keep up a face for yourself, quit this crap.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.160]   We're only glad you're not a part of our tech lives anymore.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.720]   Glad you failed Leo.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.000]   Glad you failed.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.920]   Signed a fan.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.880]   [laughter]
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.880]   So there.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   Thank you very much.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.280]   So you mentioned that Lisa Bettany did some voiceover format.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   I want to give her a plug because she's got a very, uh, gorgeous voice.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.280]   She's got a gorgeous voice.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.280]   Doesn't she have a gorgeous voice?
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   She needs to get work.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.120]   People out there, you need to get a voiceover person higher her.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.600]   You could see her Russian voice on the new Mac Heist.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600]   Mac Heist.com.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.800]   She does the, um, assignments, right?
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.480]   Yes, I do.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.800]   Very interesting ones.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   You do clues.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   Yes, I do.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.280]   You know, you and I could do moose and squirrel.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.960]   We could be, you could be Natasha.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.360]   I could be Boris Badenov.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.360]   You'd be fun.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.040]   Yes, it would be so nice.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.600]   Let's do rest of show like this.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   Okay.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   Okay.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600]   Okay.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.160]   Anyway, I just want to tell you this lady does not like me anymore.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.440]   Isn't that weird?
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.600]   I mean, I, you know, I, that's just a show.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.720]   You never gotten a letter like that in your life.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   Get them daily.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   Are you kidding, John?
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.920]   I'm going to get 20 from this show.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:23.480]   If you ever have that son of a gun, Will Wheaton or you're no gamer, you don't like
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.920]   the we or whatever, if scobles ever on again, so am I.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.440]   I get a lot about you, John.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.960]   Oh, I'm sure you do.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:34.280]   But the funny thing is then I also get, I get both because I get mail when you're not
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.120]   on like last week you were not.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   Yeah, you can't win.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.120]   I can't win.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.320]   I'm a double-edged sword.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.480]   Well, you're a double it.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.760]   What I realized is if you stick your head up out of the crowd, somebody's going to chop
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.760]   it off.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.840]   Or they're going to try to.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.560]   Yeah, they haven't succeeded yet because I've got a neck brace of steel.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.840]   Those messages ever bother you?
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.160]   I mean, oh, yeah, that bothered me.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160]   That one bothered me.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.160]   I felt terrible.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.040]   I know, you know, you can't let any of those messages bother you unless there's something
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.200]   extremely accurate about it and you realize that you screwed up and it's and.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.600]   I do feel worse when that happens.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.760]   Well, then you just, you make up and you do a make good.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   I mean, that's not a big deal.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.120]   But generally speaking, most of the complaining is just people blowing off steam or they don't
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.480]   really like you in the first place or they.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.480]   She was up.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.200]   No, I felt better about it because I just blogged it.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.200]   I put it up on the blog.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.240]   It's like the time I mentioned somebody being cross-eyed or something.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.040]   We got that note from that guy because it's got a name, I guess.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.760]   And the guy said there's cross-eyed people should be making fun of them.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.600]   Yeah, John, it's called amblyopia and I have it.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.920]   So that was me.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]   I wrote through that note.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.040]   Oh, I don't know who that was.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.440]   Do you ever get stuff like that, Robert?
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.440]   Everybody loves Robert Scoble.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.480]   No, I get stuff like that all the time.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.840]   Well, everybody loves him, but the valley-wag people.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840]   Valley-wag.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.400]   It's not just valley-wag.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.160]   You know, I have Tweet-deck running and people are having fun.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.720]   In fact, somebody said you're not an a-hole and I do follow you.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.200]   So that's nice.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.240]   But that's a lot nicer than someone's.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:10.120]   Here, Robert, you are not an a-hole, signed a fan.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.360]   You should write him a nasty note saying, "What the hell are you talking about?
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.360]   I am an a-hole!"
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360]   How dare you?
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.600]   I was actually one of the nicest guys there is to be and you can take it from me.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   Oh, Robert's a sweetie.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.200]   No, Robert is a sweetie and I've known Robert for years.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.360]   In fact, I followed with sadness the drama this week because I guess there were some
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.680]   layoffs at Fast Company and you had the layoff Rocky.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.280]   He came out with you when you did the piece on me, a really talented shooter, a great
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:43.520]   guy and if anybody knows of a job for a video editor, email Robert because...
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.520]   Who is he?
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.520]   He's my producer.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.120]   Because me view might be looking for somebody who might want to run him over there.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   Maybe he is.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.120]   Yeah, he's...
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.200]   Then you've done a great job of trying to find work for him.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.360]   Hey, as long as we're talking notes about our extended family, Amber MacArthur had her
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.360]   baby this morning.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   You guys like her?
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   Yeah, 245.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.360]   Connor?
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.360]   Connor?
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.360]   Connor?
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.360]   C-O-N-O-R.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.360]   Scott's name.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.360]   He goes with them.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360]   MacArthur.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.440]   So, he's called out of MacArthur and he's three and I don't know but I imagine she's already
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.760]   created the Twitter account and if she hasn't, too late.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.320]   Don't you do that now when you have a baby, the first thing you have to do.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.200]   In fact, you don't even name the baby until you check to see if you can get the domain
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.200]   name.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.200]   Smart money.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.200]   Smart money.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:34.120]   When we did a Twitter gram, we did an audio of his cry, his first cry was on Twitter.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.760]   Yeah, Amber announced the...
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.320]   That's the reason people don't like you.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.280]   Amber announced the birth on Twitter as a tweet.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.840]   That's how we found out.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:49.720]   And her partner, I don't think they're my partner, Kristik posted the picture on Flickr.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.920]   So they're very wired, you know.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.440]   So, I was at this Founders' Breakfast this morning talking to a bunch of entrepreneurs
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.560]   and talking about the economy.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.080]   Everybody talks about the economy.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.400]   You were at Davos this week, too.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.120]   And it sounded like a grim, grim meeting at the World Economic Forum.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.120]   You know what Davos was...
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120]   I called Davos...
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   I'm in Davos depression.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.400]   Was that there's a lot of freaked out rich people and they don't have any answers about
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.640]   how they got out of this hole.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:21.600]   Yeah, because President Obama's going to reduce their income to 500,000 a year.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600]   Aww.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.960]   Well, you had to live with what's going on now.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.840]   What's going on now?
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.280]   You know, so you made that assertion.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.640]   A bunch of, I think, Bank of America, I think a couple other of these guys who were going
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.480]   to get a bunch of pot full of money said, "No, no, no.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.480]   Take the money back.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   We don't want the money."
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.400]   They're not going to take the TARP funds so they don't have to take a cut and pay.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.920]   Because the TARP funds, they're just going to bank them anyway.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920]   And then the...
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920]   I love it, the Republicans.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920]   They don't need...
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920]   They don't have these guys don't need the funds.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920]   That's the joke of it.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.920]   And then this is just proving it.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920]   It's there.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.920]   It's a pile there and we'll take it.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.920]   Oh, but a cut and pay.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920]   Oh, no, I better not date it.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.920]   Oh, man.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:59.320]   I think we're all with some of that.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:03.680]   It's about a hundred and something founders and startups that get together once in a while
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.680]   over at somebody's house.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.680]   Oh, that sounds neat.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   Fred, new Mark was there.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:12.200]   In fact, I have a video of him that I'm going to try to upload right after we're on
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.520]   the show talking about what he's seeing.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:18.480]   He's seeing fewer jobs, more stuff being sold.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.680]   You know, as they get laid off, they start selling their provisions.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.920]   And Craigslist would be a really good indicator of that, I bet.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920]   Better.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   Yeah, it's a...
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.800]   Anyways, I met Jet Li last week.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.800]   That was fun.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.800]   Wow.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.440]   Was Jet Li at Davos?
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:42.160]   So which would you prefer to be at Ted or Davos?
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.080]   I talked to Loik Lemur this morning and he said Ted is way better.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.080]   Ted's more optimist than...
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.080]   Except for the mosquitoes.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080]   Shh.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.080]   Now you know.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.080]   Holy cow.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.480]   Ted, can you imagine if you had a picture of that on Twitter, you know?
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.560]   Yeah, I got bit by Bill Gates and the mosquitoes.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.600]   So this is kind of an old story, but I still like it.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.320]   It's a street view hack.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.120]   There is...
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.080]   It was called the Street with a View Project.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.600]   It was two art students in Pittsburgh who thought, "Let's do this.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   Let's..."
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:20.600]   Because you know, Google Street View goes around with cars with cameras on the roof.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   I actually...
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.480]   You can see the video and I thought it would be like a van, but it's actually like a shavat
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.720]   with this weird contraption on the roof.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.880]   And they just drive down the street and take lots of pictures so that you can use Google
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.160]   Street View at Google Maps.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.920]   So the art students called Google said, "Look, what we'd like to do is get...
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.320]   Know when you're going to come and set up something."
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.840]   So they've got a high school marching band.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.240]   They've got a guy grilling sausage.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:52.560]   They've got a bizarre bunch of weird stuff down this little alley.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.520]   And it's the funniest street view.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.720]   And now the reason that that happened in May now they're doing an exhibit at the Arlington
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.880]   Arts Center in Pittsburgh.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.480]   And you can find out more and see the video at streetwithofview.com.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.840]   I love that idea.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.880]   That's hack and street view.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.520]   But on the other hand, privacy advocates are a little bit more concerned about a new Google
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.880]   feature called Latitude.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.280]   Now Robert, is Latitude any different than what Brightkite's doing or Fire Eagle or
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.440]   Looped or any of these location services?
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.840]   It's different than Brightkite because you can actually follow me around.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.520]   You actually see my icon moving around town as I'm moving around.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.800]   But the problem is with us.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.160]   Brightkite, you actually have to press a button that says I am here.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.080]   So you're saying that once you turn this thing on, your phone continually broadcasts your
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.080]   location?
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.840]   Is this illegal?
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.800]   It's actually pretty cool because like I was looking at it.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.800]   Sounds like stalking to me.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800]   It is totally stalking.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.040]   In fact, that's how I said it on my blog.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.480]   I said, if you want to stalk me, go ahead and add me.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.560]   And what's funny is I can't use Latitude anymore because it crashes instantly when
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560]   I start.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.880]   Because too many people are following you?
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   Too many people.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.680]   And actually the team talked to me.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.880]   They said they only thought people would use it with 100 of their friends.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   Oh, you see.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.320]   Robert, Robert, Robert, you're always an edge case.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.960]   You're always an edge case.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   Interesting.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.920]   I trusted the system because it was not unexpected consequences.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.120]   Yeah, you know, but it's fine.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120]   It's fine.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.280]   I have a, you have to have a Symbian S60 phone or a blackberry.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.280]   I'm going to, I have a G1.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.600]   I'm going to turn on my G1 and put it on the G1.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.360]   It doesn't work on the iPhone yet probably because the iPhone will let you continually
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   broadcast.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   Press.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.820]   They're actually working on an iPhone version and that should be out shortly with even
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.820]   more features.
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.320]   But how will it work?
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   I mean, how?
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   No.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.840]   Maybe you'll have to hit a button, you know, where you are.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.720]   I've been using, I like bright kite, but unfortunately I keep posting my home address
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.040]   on my, it's not a good thing by accident.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.080]   You know, I mean, I don't mean to do that.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.440]   You're supposed to be able to say, you know, just the town, not the address.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.080]   I never turn location.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   Well, if I were you, I wouldn't.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.080]   Yeah, I really.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.920]   If I were you, Lisa, I wouldn't.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.080]   In fact, I wouldn't even tell you to say what country you're in right now.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:11.040]   I mean, I've had problems, I just changed all my who is IDs to private.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.160]   Because you have information in there about your location.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.160]   Yes.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.520]   Do you have you have Stikers or people actually bugging you?
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.920]   No, I mean, most of my sort of fans are pretty positive.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.920]   I worry about people like you and Justine and Veronica and Amber.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.320]   All those women that are in, you remember when we were at the tech team, you know, all
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:38.640]   the women that are on the air that are high profile good looking perform performers and
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.280]   even some not so good looking, if you know what I mean.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.080]   I'm trying to think who.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.640]   So, or get to have Stalkers and it's like ridiculous.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.640]   These guys are so bored.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:59.200]   I mean, I get I get people send me things before I changed it to private because they
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:04.080]   had my address, which is my business is my home.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.200]   So I had that problem and yeah, you don't want to give away your home address.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.000]   I wouldn't think no, even in Canada.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.560]   Yeah, people are nice in Canada, but let's not push it too far.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.840]   Everyone's so I'll poke my head out the window just to check.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.840]   No mouth breathers.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.360]   Give one of those.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360]   Give one.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.960]   Also get one of those things that starts your car remotely.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.600]   Not a bad idea.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.600]   So this is a little frustrating.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.680]   I've got the Google phone and Android phone and I went to latitude.
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.880]   I said, okay, send me the link.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.960]   It sent me the link.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.520]   It says coming soon.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.560]   Well, you've been snooker.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.960]   How could it not be available on the Google phone?
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   It is.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   Isn't it, Robert?
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.960]   I'm not sure.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   I don't have a.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.960]   You're using on a Nokia?
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.280]   So, so what do you think of the Google phone so far?
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.280]   Because I've got one too.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.040]   I use it to about two or three days a week.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.120]   No, it's it's an okay phone.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.360]   It's a little big little clunky.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.720]   I like the keyboard, but the battery life is what's killing me.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.040]   And it could have battery life's horrible.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.960]   I mean, it's not it's unusable because it's only three hours.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.440]   So I mean, that kind of that's pretty much ends that.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.080]   I mean, it's an okay phone.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.880]   It's kind of interesting that I found.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.920]   So I have this old I have a sim.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.160]   I guess it's been floating from, I don't know, from who to who.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.040]   But I got it and I, you know, when I program my the people that I have on my name and address
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:25.280]   book, I took it from the noke and I stuck it into the Google G phone and it brought up
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:28.680]   all the names that whoever else had this this.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.320]   They save their addresses to the sim.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.840]   That's kind of a mistake when you have a review phone.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.240]   Not a good idea.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240]   Was it Lisa that needs phone?
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.440]   Because I'd really like to know where she's living these.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.440]   No.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.680]   Yeah, you can probably find out with someone with stalking programs.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.680]   Stalkers need love to.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.360]   Yeah, they said that you need the RC 33 update for your phone and it's coming this
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.360]   week.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.760]   Ah, he's plugged in that guy.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.920]   Ah, I have four screens running in front of me then.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.520]   I'm almost as good as Leo.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.480]   Leo has, I think, one, two, three, four, five.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.480]   I got your beat.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   I got five.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.480]   See, I need another screen.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.960]   You know, we're doing one of the things that's been a little bit of a problem with the panel
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:15.560]   shows, Twit and Mac break weekly, is that I don't get video when I have multiple calls
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560]   on Skype.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:21.840]   So we're actually building a unit with four PCs in it, four internet connections, four
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.280]   screens.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.720]   And then I will call each of you on each separate one and I'll have video of all four of you
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.880]   or however many people are on.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.040]   And then I can switch to all of you and then I can do an Octobox like they do on CNBC.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.840]   That's what I really want, the Octobox.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.840]   Brother.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:42.840]   Can I start by the way, next Saturday we're going to start doing the Gilmore Gang live
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.720]   on the Twit livestream.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.640]   So you'll be able to watch the Gilmore Gang on this.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.960]   So can I give a couple of thank yous to the couple of fans?
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.960]   Please do.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:58.120]   Jason Baker, who got me an Oklahoma University footy with a zipper.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.840]   And you know, every year of course during the college football season, I solicit championship
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840]   gear.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.280]   And since Florida wouldn't send me anything, I got from Oklahoma.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.880]   And Dave Mangano from Richmond, Virginia got me the University of Richmond thing.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.920]   And he has a, by the way, something called scooter internet radio and you can Google
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.920]   it.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.720]   And it's cool about the, you know, the Richmond spiders, which is what the hoodie is, well,
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.480]   I mean, you start with school about Mangano.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.880]   He used to live in Port Angeles and had been to the deli and then moved to Richmond and
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.160]   then sent me a shirt.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.840]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.760]   Well, anyway.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.760]   And I also want as long as we're pausing here in between news stories, I do want to
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.000]   say a shout out to our friends in Australia.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.880]   You know, it's not getting a lot of coverage here in the US, but there's a massive fight
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.440]   on the fire in the bush in Victoria right now.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.680]   Over a hundred people have died.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.240]   Many homes burned.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.480]   It is really a great tragedy.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.120]   We have many listeners in Australia.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:01.280]   So our thoughts and prayers go out to you and we wish you the best.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:05.200]   And I do hope you're okay down under.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.200]   You were just down there, Lisa.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.200]   I know you have many friends.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.200]   Yeah, no, I do.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   I do.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:14.120]   And it's really concerning and apparently was the fire was started by an arsonist.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.120]   You're kidding.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.720]   Because if you look at the map, it is spread.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.720]   It's spread.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.820]   Yes, you can see it.
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.840]   Most of southeastern Australia is engulfed.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.320]   I mean, it's, well, I get better hope he doesn't get caught.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.920]   Oh, man.
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.760]   They put them on air is rock and lighted on fire.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.760]   Other stories get ready to party like it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.160]   nine, zero on Valentine's day.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.240]   What are you laughing at?
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.600]   Unix, Unix clocks.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.600]   This is so geeky.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.200]   Actually, it's Friday, February 13th.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.880]   The official Unix calendar, you know, which has been counting the number of seconds.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:58.000]   It's midnight January 1st, 1970 when I was born Dave will reach the magic number one billion,
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:06.480]   234,567,890 seconds, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, zero.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.720]   I think that's really cool.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.720]   I need a t-shirt.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.160]   We should have had we'll wait and on for that one.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.160]   Why that's cool.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.160]   Why didn't I bring that up?
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.960]   That's so cool.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.960]   I need an XXL t-shirt on that right moment.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.600]   One, two, three, five, seven, eight, nine, two, three, four, yeah.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.600]   That's pretty cool, huh?
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.600]   You know, there's nothing cooler than that.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.600]   All right.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.600]   All right.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.600]   All right.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.600]   All right.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600]   And no, I didn't get a Kansas shirt.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.600]   Let's see here.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.600]   So why is accepted a job, did he?
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.320]   Let's bring it up right around again.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.400]   I don't know why he took that job.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.880]   You know, I think it's just because he thinks it's cool.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.880]   I don't think he needs a money.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:46.880]   I hope he doesn't need the money.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.680]   I think it's just maybe just wants free hard disks.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.680]   Those are nice hard disks.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.800]   They're very fast.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.600]   Juicy campus is gone.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.600]   This kind of surprises me.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.240]   Juicy campus seemed like a natural.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:03.240]   This was the site where you would go to read the filthiest, vilest gossip about college
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:07.160]   kids posted by their, quote, friends and enemies.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.480]   It was a site that was blocked by many universities.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:17.080]   One college official called it a virtual bathroom wall of hate and degrading speech.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.240]   It went offline on Thursday.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.840]   It was getting more than a million uniques a month.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.640]   People could post anonymously.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.320]   Fraternities and sororities would cruelly attack each other.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:35.960]   You'd see threads like biggest slut on campus, easiest freshman, fattest, coed.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:36.960]   That's not pretty file.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.640]   It was protected, of course, by free speech laws.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.640]   It's interesting.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.440]   They had a million hits a month.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.880]   We had that same number on the Dvorak Uncensored blog, which is also a file and disgusting.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.880]   Really?
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.600]   And you're blocked in many universities as well.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600]   No.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:55.400]   Although, you know, actually you are censored by some, some sensor where sensors you because
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:02.760]   you occasionally will have mildly, mildly sexy pictures that we've never shown abreast.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.480]   You know, Lisa hasn't either.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480]   So there you go.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.480]   It's not a beanie.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.440]   Neither, neither have I for that matter.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.520]   Although I could do it right now.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.520]   It could be a first.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.440]   Come on, do it, do it, do it.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.440]   Do it.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.440]   Take it off.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.880]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:24.480]   I have too much respect for myself and our viewers to do that.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.560]   But then I could be one of those porn stars you follow on Twitter.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:32.400]   The most boring tweets you ever read.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.280]   How can they compare with Mr. Kutcher?
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.880]   Mr. Kutcher and Mrs. Kutcher.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.360]   Mrs. Kutcher.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.960]   Ashton Kutcher is A plus K. And apparently he and Demi Moore really are in love because
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:49.880]   because once a day she'll say, I just love Ashton so much.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.760]   And it's not, you know, this is not a case of somebody posting for them.
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:56.320]   I'm pretty sure because no one would write this stuff except them.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.320]   Is that bad?
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.160]   It proves that movie stars are just like you and me.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.720]   Is that what it proves?
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.720]   Yeah, it really does.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:03.720]   Really?
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.720]   Really?
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:05.720]   Goodness.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.960]   Now I'm looking at the map of Australia, the latest on CNN.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.920]   And it's not just Southeast.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:10.920]   It's not just the Bush.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:11.920]   It's not just Victoria.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.360]   It's spread all over the entire continent.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.360]   Terrible.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360]   100 wildfires.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.160]   100 people killed.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.000]   Many, many acres burning is terrible.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   There must be some.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.280]   There must have some interesting weather conditions.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280]   Well, you know, it's.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   It's.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.280]   Yeah, it's end of summer.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.280]   Mm.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.280]   You haven't had a break.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.280]   I'm worried.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.760]   Google's going to put some.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:38.200]   Now this is an interesting story that does kind of tie into that Kindle story.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:44.360]   Google's going to start putting eBooks 1.5 million public domain eBooks online on devices
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.480]   like the T-Mobile G1 and the iPhone.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.360]   In fact, Amazon also says it's going to start taking some of the titles it's making for Kindle
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.360]   and making them available on other portable devices, which makes me wonder, do you really
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.360]   want a Kindle?
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:01.640]   Maybe the thing to do is just to get better readers on your phone.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.440]   I talked to the lady who runs the Google team who makes the iPhone.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.400]   I found out that they just announced this morning, actually, and she said, you'll still
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.560]   want a Kindle for the latest books because some books will be sold there and they're
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.960]   not going to be available on Google.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.080]   These are all public domain books, I would guess.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.920]   And also the device, the Kindle device is interesting because you can read it on the beach
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:25.720]   because it has a reflective screen on it.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.160]   That uses very little power.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.960]   So the batteries last forever, you know, nine hours to 13 hours.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.120]   Yeah, you could kill your iPhone.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.480]   Although we were talking, I think it's Philip Ryu who wrote this, your friend Philip wrote
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.400]   this, Lisa, the classics application on the iPhone.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.360]   I was going to bring that up because it's beautiful.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.120]   I mean, it's really legible.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.040]   Like, I've never sort of thought, oh, you could read a book on a phone, but with something
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:53.680]   like that, I mean, if other apps are developed and more literature gets on to the iPhone,
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:59.400]   I mean, it just seems like such, you know, such a bulky thing to bring your phone and
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:06.160]   your Kindle and like who has, I want someone to build a vest where you can just have pockets
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.160]   for all these things.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.160]   Scott porn has that.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.800]   Yeah, they need to make those for maybe girls as well.
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.800]   No, no, it only comes in one size and that's pretty big.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.760]   I'd wear it to be honest.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:24.720]   Like I would, you know, CF card pocket, SD and you've got your iPhone and you've got
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:29.680]   your, you know, video camera all just in a, it's kind of like a bulletproof vest.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.040]   I don't think, you know, I don't think this would kill the iPhone.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.200]   I mean, you're not going to read eight hours a day, but I think this is, it's very legible.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:40.320]   In fact, it's more legible in some ways, Robert, because the iPhone is backlit, so
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.280]   you don't need light for it.
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.920]   Except if you're on the beach and sunlight.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.200]   Okay, so I'm not going to read this on the beach.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.200]   Would you really bring a Kindle?
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.200]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:52.440]   I did it, but I live in half me and be.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.480]   I mean, I think about on the, on the jacket, the original sun there.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.480]   Best thing in the world.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.520]   Get a cheap paperback book.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.440]   You know, you don't really care if it gets sandy, if it gets wet, if it gets mustard
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.800]   on it and you throw it away at the end of the summer.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.680]   I know I think the Kindle is not beach wear.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:08.680]   Mustard.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.680]   It absolutely is.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.680]   You don't bring mustard to the beach?
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.680]   Not for my books.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.560]   Well, I find it's helpful in tanning.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.560]   Just me.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560]   Maybe it's just me.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.560]   No, it could be.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.560]   Just me.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.560]   It's just me.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.440]   I travel too much to carry books around.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.400]   I mean, I have a stack of books here that I need to read and they're happy to carry around.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.760]   That's why eBooks are great.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.680]   I agree with you.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.240]   You carry a lot of gear with you, don't you?
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.240]   Absolutely.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.240]   Not me.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.240]   Not me.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.240]   I got the Kindle.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.240]   I got the laptop that's all I need.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.800]   And my iPhone, because I have by 40 or 50 books on audio, the Audible books, and I really
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.000]   feel like I've got a ton of entertainment.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.040]   In fact, you know, there's now a TED Talks application for the iPhone, which is great.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.040]   You can see all the movies, all the audio.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.240]   It's just really wonderful.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.600]   So it was a good week for procrastinators.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.040]   Congress agreed to put off the switch to digital TV until June 12th.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.640]   So you could forget about it for another four or five months.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.840]   We'll have to do it again.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.040]   Hey, how about this for an idea?
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.000]   They never make the switch.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.560]   That would make Verizon and AT&T a little angry since they pay billions, billions for
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:19.840]   access, not to mention the fact that there are emergency radios on these new frequencies.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.240]   These emergency channels are probably freaking out a little bit, because now they're not
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.440]   going to be able to occupy them until June.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:29.840]   I think they were able to make an exception for some of those frequencies.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.680]   And you know, channels can, you know, most channels already are digital.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.440]   It just means they don't have to turn off the analog till the 12th.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:39.120]   So I'm going to look at the chat room.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:46.600]   Somebody sent me a link to a comparison of devorac.org, Leoville, and Twitt TV.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.800]   These are worthless though.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.800]   Oh no, I know they're worthless.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   But here's what's interesting.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.400]   They have a search analytics top keywords driving traffic to Twitt TV.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.400]   Yeah, one.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   Devorac.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.400]   No, no, no, no.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.400]   Twitt's good.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.400]   Let me do the joke.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.520]   Sorry, I'll get out of the way.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.360]   Number one, Twitt and number two, Twitt Live.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:08.520]   Now the top keywords driving traffic to leoville.com is Leo Laport and Leoville.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:16.160]   And the top two for devorac.org is John C. Devorac and public urination India.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.520]   Did you do an expose on public urination?
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.960]   I don't remember ever seeing that.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.760]   That's pretty funny.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.320]   Was that driving traffic though?
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:30.760]   Is that Google analytics or is that complete?
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.760]   Complete.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760]   Complete.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760]   Or compete, yeah.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.760]   Yeah, I compete.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   Sorry.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   Yeah, those are those stats.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.960]   You know, a really questionable because I think they're based on the Alexa toolbar.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   Yeah, it's a fake, but I just still remember it.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.560]   When I look at my actual numbers to Leoville or Twitt, they never match.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.560]   What the?
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:49.320]   Well, I had for a while, I had like a couple of offs.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.880]   I had two different search or these little analytic tools on the website and then I had
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.680]   one on the server.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.560]   And then I'd compare them to Alexis.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.560]   And Alexis in particular is really bad because if you don't have a lot of you have a tool
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.560]   bar and people don't.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:07.720]   Well, the tool bar sucks and it's it comes out to find.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.200]   Yeah, our users don't are smart enough not to use.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   Right.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.240]   So we're not going to have any of our readers or users that are ever going to use the thing.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.000]   And then it doesn't work with Firefox anyway, which is like the least hat my users 60% of
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   use Firefox.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000]   Yeah, fine too.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   Quotches is actually the best one to watch.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.400]   There is a Google.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.760]   There's a bookmark now that Google does some analytics.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.000]   And I presume that they pull it from whatever they know about.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.560]   I would think that'd be fairly useful.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:40.160]   I'm trying to find the link because I used to have it on my toolbar.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.640]   I ended up taking it off.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.520]   But for a while I would go to sites and you could actually, you know, you could have a
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.080]   toolbar and link, you press this button that would give you all the analytics for that
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.080]   site.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080]   It was kind of interesting.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.880]   Those seem like they'd be more useful, more accurate.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.040]   Leo, what are you using to just monitor your own stats?
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.640]   I use Google analytics.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.280]   And lookery, which I was playing with for a little bit.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.560]   There's a few things that give you, and you know, I say about Google analytics, you get
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.560]   beautiful views.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.440]   I mean, I have, you know, AWS and what, you know, what is it?
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:09.440]   Webalyzer.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.440]   I love those running on my server too.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.440]   But I like Google analytics.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.640]   I think you get nice little pretty pictures.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.840]   I just got mint and I really like it.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:17.840]   Mints great.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.000]   Mints great.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   I love mint.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   It's minty fresh.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000]   It is minty fresh.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   All of these are the same thing.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.520]   They put a little JavaScript stub on your page and then they give you analytics based
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.680]   on it.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.720]   So what's so good about mint?
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.920]   There's all these plugins that you can add that sort of are very specific, you know,
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.600]   search terms and you know, you can sort of follow people, you know, if people come to
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.720]   your site, you can sort of track.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.920]   They're called crushes.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:50.320]   You know how often they come back and it just, I mean, visually it's a lot to sort of take
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.640]   in, but I think you can sort of really--
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.800]   It's useful stuff, yeah.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.640]   Just add the pieces that you want to follow and you can sort of organize them that way.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:03.760]   Sort of like a wigity, move, drag and drop kind of--
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.320]   Have a mint.com.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.320]   Have a mint.com.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.320]   Is that what it is?
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.320]   Have a mint?
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:12.120]   Yeah, because there's also that mint, that site that takes all your financial information.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.320]   You're going to check it.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.320]   Check it out.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.520]   What do you-- do you use anything, Robert?
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.280]   You probably don't even care.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.280]   I don't care.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.280]   He's got numbers.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.360]   They're so astronomic that he doesn't even care.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.800]   Is this just under dig?
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:24.800]   He's like Chuck Norris.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.760]   Actually, we use Google Analytics, a few other stuff that's got--
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.920]   Scoble doesn't measure the internet.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.920]   The internet measures Scoble.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.160]   No, I just watch Tweet Deck if they're talking about me.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.160]   It's cool.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.080]   It's all you care about, is it?
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.840]   To tell you the truth, it totally matches up with the stats anyways.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.680]   If they're talking about you, your hits go up.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:46.560]   If they don't talk about you, then your hits go down.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.560]   Do you--
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.560]   Go ahead.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.560]   At least--
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:53.880]   So how do you feel about sort of the influx of celebrities on Twitter?
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.360]   Do you feel like they're encroaching on your territory?
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360]   Not at all.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.440]   They're bringing new people into the system.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.360]   Must the people who they bring in, though, they don't care about tech.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.360]   No, before I-- you predicted this years a year ago, John.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.480]   Yeah, you're right off the bat, actually.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.600]   I was saying it was going to-- that would be the backbreaker.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.000]   Same thing happens to podcasting.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:13.840]   It's happening to blogging.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.320]   It's what we were talking about before.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:20.800]   When the big guys come in, the early adopters, the tech people like us, we're just--
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.080]   you know, also bins.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.600]   Yeah, I would say you're going to slouch on Twitter.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600]   Yeah, really.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.240]   How many thousands of followers do you have?
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.080]   86,000.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.080]   But you know, Steve--
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.680]   --in a month goes to $107,000.
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.680]   I mean--
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:38.760]   And there are people who are more popular in the real world.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:39.760]   Rightly.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.400]   There are people more popular than you.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.000]   There's no one more popular than you are.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.400]   I don't like that.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.400]   Imagine if Obama actually Twitter--
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.840]   He's got now a quarter of a million followers.
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.800]   Yeah, but if he actually did it, he would go to millions.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:31:02.360]   Stephen Fry's $155,000, CNN 144,000, Kevin Rose $102,000, Twitter itself.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.520]   See, but this is weird because Twitter's had an account since day one.
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.240]   All of a sudden, it goes, "Mm."
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:12.240]   Yeah, these numbers are weird because, you know, the funny thing is, I was about a year
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.920]   ago, I was fighting to get into the top 10.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.920]   And I think I got to number eight.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.800]   And you know, when the numbers weren't as what they are today.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.800]   And then I kind of just--
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:21.480]   once I got past, I said, "Ah, I don't even care to follow it anymore."
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.480]   Now I'm like number 30 or something like that.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.880]   I fell way off.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.000]   And because I haven't been-- but remember, I was pumping it.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.840]   Remember, the real Devorak, Admi, the real Devorak.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:35.400]   And so you could maintain, but we haven't been doing the kind of promotion needed to
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.400]   keep those numbers up.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.880]   And I think it's kind of tedious to keep--
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   It is.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:39.880]   I don't want to--
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:40.880]   How?
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.680]   I mean, I did that with a Devorak.org/blog and I stopped doing that gag.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.680]   Right.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.080]   The camera's having a Twitter backlash, by the way.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.000]   They hate us talking about Twitter.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.160]   And they should.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.160]   You should hate us for this.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:58.000]   I'm actually working on posts of what to do instead of doing Twitter because it really
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.720]   doesn't help you at all.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:00.720]   I don't know.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:05.120]   I think the fact that it's gone mainstream is actually a sign that it's more powerful,
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   don't you think?
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.960]   You think it's less important?
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.600]   It depends on your trying to reach.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:14.800]   Bill Gates came up to me last week at Davos and said, "Thanks for writing about his annual
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.800]   letter."
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:16.800]   I saw that.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:17.800]   That was amazing.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.240]   So he actually read-- and that was on Friend Feed, right?
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.680]   On Twitter, it doesn't matter.
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:25.680]   Which proves the point.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.320]   He doesn't read Twitter and Friend Feed.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:31.360]   It was somebody who works for him, who noticed all these hits were coming from someplace
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:34.280]   on the internet and told him to go check it out.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:38.360]   Yeah, but then he knew you and he recognized you and he connected the two.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.360]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.280]   I don't think Bill Gates would walk up to me and say, "I mean, I commented on it.
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.280]   I don't think he'd walk up to me.
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.080]   I don't think he'd know who the hell I am."
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.480]   He's not a gatian, no suya.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.480]   No.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.480]   No idea.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.480]   I hope to God he has no idea who I am.
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:54.400]   He should know who you are.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.720]   I'm afraid of him.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:59.440]   That was one of the nicest guys there is.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.440]   He's too smart.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.360]   Well, he's smart and that's a little intimidating.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.360]   It's really intimidating.
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:06.840]   He's doing awesome work.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.840]   He is.
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:08.840]   I read because of your--
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.440]   Well, I want to start out Friend Fest here.
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:18.320]   No, no, no, because of Scobel's comment about it, I did read it was a long article on the
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.240]   Gates Foundation about what--
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.440]   Like a year end letter.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:28.280]   And I was very impressed with his analytic ability, what he's decided to spend the rest
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.480]   of his life doing, and how important it is.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.480]   I mean, I think it's really-- that's fantastic.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.800]   I think it is too a step.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.720]   I think he should fix Windows.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.840]   He doesn't have anything to do with it anymore.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.120]   And by the way, I think Windows 7 does fix Windows.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120]   I think Windows 7 does.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:43.120]   They haven't loaded it up with all the overhead yet.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.120]   Right.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:45.120]   Well, no, not yet.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.120]   That's how it's going to be.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.120]   No.
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.120]   It's done.
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.120]   Next-- no, no, no.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.720]   And we don't want to change it.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.800]   This is complete.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:57.080]   I guarantee they're going to throw a bunch of anti-security crap and all kinds of overhead.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.080]   Well, they did.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.080]   And that's one of our stories.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:02.320]   They did-- remember, there was a little fewer because they'd set you-- you know, one of
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.120]   the things they said, well, we're going to fix UAC and we know it bugs people.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.680]   So the way they fixed it, they turned it down.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.280]   They made it less effective.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.640]   And people complained, my god, you've turned it down to the point where now a bad guy can
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.440]   get on your system and turn it off.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.880]   And at first, Microsoft said, well, we know.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.960]   We did it on purpose, but the Fuhrer was so great.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.880]   They just announced a couple of days ago.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   Okay.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   Okay, we're going to turn it up.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.320]   But when we ship Windows 7, UAC will be turned up all the way.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.040]   Has you said the Fuhrer was great?
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.400]   Is that not correct?
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.880]   The Fuhrer was great.
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.040]   So great.
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.040]   The great Fuhrer.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.040]   Sorry.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.680]   The Fuhrer was great.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.000]   And I will love him all my life.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.840]   I was channeling Kenneth Mars for a moment.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.840]   There I apologize.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.840]   That was good.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.080]   That was a very good Kenneth Mars.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.520]   No one knows what you and I are talking about right now.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.480]   Well, somebody does.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:59.160]   Spling time for Hitler and Germany.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.160]   I actually just watched the downfall.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.160]   Has anyone.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:03.160]   Oh, is that great?
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.640]   Well, you see it on YouTube in about 800 different ways, don't you?
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:12.600]   I want to thank the person in the chat room that sent me to coedmagazine.com.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.840]   No, that was my that's the link that I posted.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:18.160]   So that's the porn star suit Twitter.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.560]   Yes, I got that email.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.840]   That's why I got that email because I sent people to that site.
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.560]   But I said not safe for work.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:30.480]   I use the universally accepted NSFW acronym.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.280]   And apparently this woman's I almost said her name.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:38.280]   This woman's husband does not know that that means there are naked girls when you click
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.280]   this link.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.840]   There's actually no naked girls on this thing.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.840]   No, it's half-quoted.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.840]   It's provocative.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.840]   But he's weak and that's enough.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.840]   That's all it takes.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.920]   So is anyone who watches the Grammys?
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.400]   Yes, in fact, it's on like any minute now, right?
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.880]   And I'm actually looking at the website, which is possibly not the greatest website I've
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:00.880]   ever seen.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:03.880]   And it's a right one of the first it's Grammys.com.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:04.880]   Grammys.com.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.080]   I thought my grandmother had that one.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.080]   Grammys.com.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:10.080]   That's my.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.080]   Grammys.com.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.000]   Who is this old guy?
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   Oh, Neil Diamond is the music cares person of the year.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.400]   They're really right on top of music trends, aren't they?
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.400]   Sure are.
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:24.280]   And they're saying add us on Facebook.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:27.960]   They said follow us at twitter.com/thegrammys.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.960]   It's the official Twitter Grammy feed.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.880]   All this website.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:36.680]   This is where, you know what, Twitter has jumped the shark, hasn't it?
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:41.320]   If it's on the Grammy site, follow us on Twitter.
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:44.120]   It has totally jumped the shark.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.640]   I now know how you felt, Robert, when you jumped the shark.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.640]   When I jumped the shark.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.880]   When was that exactly?
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.520]   At which time?
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.880]   I've jumped the shark so many times I've lost count.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.440]   You know, I get that email also every week.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.280]   Twitter has finally jumped the shark.
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.080]   Oh, God.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.560]   It's so hopeless.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to let you go watch the Grammys in peace.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.080]   Yeah, we thank you all for being here.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.080]   Throw it off the road.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.080]   Right.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:18.920]   I jumped the shark, drove off the road, went under the bridge, down the road.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:21.400]   You can find Lisa at mostly Lisa.com.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:27.040]   And she's also the Russian babe on the Mac heist giving you your assignments.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.040]   But I just...
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.960]   It takes the best pictures of birds.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.960]   She is a great...
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:31.960]   Isn't she a good photographer?
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:32.960]   She's amazing.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:33.960]   I really like her.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:34.960]   It's a remarkable...
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.960]   Well, she's...
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.760]   And she's only been doing it for a couple of years.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:40.000]   Yeah, well some women have a natural eye.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000]   You noticed this.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000]   You know what else?
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.880]   She is a champion figure skater.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.880]   That's true.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.880]   That's true.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.880]   That's true.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:53.760]   She can build a robot out of mince and super glue.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.080]   Mince and super glue.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.580]   Mince and super glue.
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.580]   Mostly Lisa that kind.
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:58.580]   You'll find it all there.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:37:59.580]   And I like the new site a lot.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:00.580]   I think that's a great redesign Lisa.
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:01.580]   Thank you.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:07.940]   I decided that it was time for me to rebrand a little bit and take away the emphasis on
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:08.940]   my face.
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:09.940]   The sexy stuff.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:14.460]   Yeah, and more on what I'm doing and highlighting the content.
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:21.020]   It's kind of a shame because the old site Lisa is model beautiful.
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:24.900]   And we talked about this and I think that unfortunately people focus, they fixate on
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.380]   that and they don't hear what you're saying and they don't see your brain.
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:32.660]   So unfortunately you have to dress down a little bit and hide your good looks so that
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:34.220]   people will listen to you.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:37.100]   Yeah, I'd rather be respected.
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.100]   That's what I do.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.100]   I've been doing that for years.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:40.100]   Yeah, you have Leo.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:41.100]   Yeah, because I'm really.
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:43.300]   It's a marketing mistake for the both of you.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:47.380]   If you take your top off right now Leo, we would have better numbers on the show.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:48.460]   No, no, we wouldn't.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:50.940]   I could tell you right now.
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:54.100]   Mr. Devorak is available at channeldevorak.com.
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:59.140]   He actually, many don't know it, but does more podcasts than I do every week.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:05.900]   For a long time you did like 23 columns a month and now you kind of replaced them all
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:06.900]   with podcasts.
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:12.180]   I'm doing a lot more than I used to and we've doubled up on the no agenda.
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.180]   You're the one that taught me.
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.180]   I gave it.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:20.020]   We have exchanged you and I have known each other for a long time.
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.020]   We exchanged places because I learned everything I knew from you.
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:24.860]   I gave it a break and one thing I gave it to help you on something else and we go back
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:25.860]   to the back.
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:26.860]   You started me.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.260]   If it weren't for you, I would still be a DJ.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.620]   Yeah, I doubt that.
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:34.660]   But back and forth and back and forth, but you got me to interested in podcasting.
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.300]   It's not like I don't know how to use a microphone.
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:39.980]   But I never, you know, there's all this stuff that's specific and that's actually one of
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:45.380]   the reasons I went to work at Mevio is because I wanted to learn from the inside out the
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.820]   business, which was this new media.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:50.740]   You know, you can be a writer forever and you know, you're never going to pick this stuff
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.580]   up just casually.
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:56.140]   And so now I'm podcasting because you can do it so easily when you know how to do it.
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:59.460]   And now the master has exceeded the student.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.460]   We'll see.
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:01.460]   Ha ha.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:07.780]   Devorak.org/blog, but best yet go to channel Devorak because that's where he sticks everything.
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:08.780]   Wil Wheaton was here.
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:12.140]   He is Wil W on Twitter and he's now in the top 15, I think.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:17.180]   He's rising fast of a young and fast rising star of the internet.
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:19.340]   Wil Wheaton.net is his site.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.340]   And Robert Scobel, I'm so glad we got you on.
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:23.220]   It's kind of fun to have a drop by.
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.220]   Yeah.
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.220]   Thank you.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.220]   Sorry about the headphone.
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.940]   No, we got to work in and I'm glad, you know, it was perfect because when Wil left, you
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.580]   came back and it was great.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:32.940]   I'm actually building a studio just like yours.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.940]   So I need some.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:34.940]   Are you?
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:35.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:37.420]   Not quite as expensive as yours.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:40.180]   Maybe I'll have one of those $1,600 lights instead of two.
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:41.860]   Well, you know, it doesn't matter.
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:42.860]   It's not about the lights.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:44.820]   It's about the ability to do that stream.
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.140]   And I'm really glad to hear that.
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.140]   I think that's wonderful.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:52.780]   And that means that you and I can, you know, you can be on in video, for instance, next
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.180]   time.
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:41:00.500]   I want everybody to build a studio like this so that we can all stream on the internet.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:01.820]   And then I don't know what happens after that.
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:02.820]   I haven't figured.
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:03.820]   I haven't thought that far ahead.
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:04.820]   You was awesome.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:05.820]   We all take off.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:07.820]   It was totally awesome.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:11.340]   It was the most awesome thing ever.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:18.340]   Good twit is well into the can.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:38.460]   I'm going to do it.
