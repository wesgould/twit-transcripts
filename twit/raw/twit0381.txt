[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   It's time for Twit This Week in Tech.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.100]   I'm back and I, there's been a, oh my gosh,
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.420]   a lot of tech news.

[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.240]   Hey, I'm back.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.600]   How you doing?
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.720]   Thanks to Sarah Lane for filling in for me

[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.840]   I appreciate that.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.920]   It gave me a chance to take a little time off.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.960]   I'm back from a trip down under and a hello
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.560]   to all of our fans down there.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.840]   Boy, this is surprisingly chad.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.400]   There were hundreds of people showed up at this bar,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.320]   the Hearts Pub in the Rocks for a meetup in Sydney.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.840]   I couldn't get in.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.080]   So I'm sorry if I didn't see you,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.880]   but I just couldn't get in, so I went on.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.640]   And that was on their game date.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.520]   That's because it was the Melbourne Cup.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.120]   But that was just people to see me.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.160]   And I saw a bunch of people, Alice and Sheridan,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.040]   joined me from the nozilla cast.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.200]   Don McAllister, our friend from Screencast Online,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.080]   was also there.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.680]   It's great that we have a lot.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.600]   So hello to everybody in Australia and New Zealand
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.280]   and Anzac or whatever it is, because it was great to know
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.760]   we have such fans down there.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.720]   Really thrilled.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.480]   And I want to go back.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.080]   Frankly, it was beautiful.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.480]   Saw a total eclipse.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.640]   I'm drawing a circle with my hand.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.680]   That's the sun.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.840]   The moon went in front of it.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.400]   It was dark.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.520]   If you've never seen a total eclipse,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.360]   it's kind of mind boggling, frankly.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.520]   The sun goes out.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.760]   Did you know that?
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.400]   It just disappears.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.320]   Wow.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.400]   Now, reposter in our chat room was there.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.680]   I signed his phone.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.880]   There's proof.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.560]   So that was fun.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.280]   It was really fun.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.240]   I will go back.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.560]   Aasnid, good to see you.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.560]   Aasnid was on the cruise with us.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.600]   Very generous.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.640]   Lots of fun.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.840]   Lots of fun.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.400]   Our guest today on Twitter, good to have Mark Milian back
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.040]   from Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.920]   Nice to see you again.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.000]   How's everything going?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.680]   Very good.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.920]   I'm glad we have a really prestigious group here
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.640]   of actual tech journalists so that I can get filled in
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.880]   on what happened while I was gone, because I wasn't paying--
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   there's no internet on the boat, where there is.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.600]   But it's very slow.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   So I really don't know what--
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.240]   It's a little inexpensive.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.440]   Yeah, it's very expensive.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.480]   That's Harry McCracken of Time Magazine.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.840]   Hi, Harry.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.700]   Good to see you and the Technologizer blog,
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.600]   Technologizer.com.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   Yeah, you can get online.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.200]   But it's like, well, if you're on vacation, why, you shouldn't.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.080]   And actually, I don't know which is more expensive.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.080]   It might be the cruise internet.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.840]   It might be just the AT&T bandwidth.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.720]   And then Verizon--
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.840]   I'm on my iPhone with Verizon.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.000]   I paid for an international data plan, which I thought
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   was $25 for 100 megabytes, which is not much data for that much
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   money.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.760]   And I got a message from Verizon saying, oh, we're not
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.640]   covering this country.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.040]   And by the way, you've already spent 200 bucks.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.920]   I just turned the phone on.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.360]   So I immediately turned--
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.800]   They weren't covering Australia.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.440]   It was New Caledonia.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.920]   I think they weren't covering.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.880]   That's where McHale's Navy took place.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.080]   Many people might be interested in that.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.640]   Also here, Matthew Ingram from Gigahome and Canada.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.080]   Yes.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.040]   And you're not sure Lizar.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.920]   Unless you're a Scrona beard.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.800]   No, I'm not.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.360]   Hey, Matthew, great to have you.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.200]   Are you in Ontario?
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.720]   I can't remember where you are.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.280]   I am, yeah.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.720]   Toronto.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.360]   Toronto.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.520]   So did anything happen over the last couple of weeks?
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.200]   I saw-- and I know you talked about this last week,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.800]   but I saw that Stevenson-Ofsky quit at Microsoft
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.520]   or was fired.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.080]   Which was it?
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.960]   Was he fired?
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.280]   Did he quit?
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.520]   Officially, he quit.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   Officially, essentially.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.160]   It's like you don't believe it.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.440]   Well, it's sort of the mass exodus of the supposed jerks,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.960]   is how they're painting it after forestall.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.160]   That's what McCracken said.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.960]   It's like he was forestalled.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.200]   Well, it sounds like they didn't beg him to stay.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.840]   Maybe that's the right of--
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.800]   was that the story that Sinofsky wasn't a nice man?
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.320]   Right.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.000]   I mean, just that he was sort of very cutthroat
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.360]   within the ranks.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.040]   Some of my colleagues did a business week story
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.680]   about how the old Microsoft was each division
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.000]   fought for their resources.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.520]   And it was even encouraged to go and coach people
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.520]   from the other divisions to sort of build up your group.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.880]   And it was very competitive.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.480]   And now the new Microsoft that Ballmer is trying to foster
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.160]   is they want everybody to work together, Metro,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.680]   across everything.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.200]   Got it.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.760]   You know, unified group, unified UI, unified everything.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.280]   So it won't be just Sinofsky then.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.120]   I mean, if they're going to recreate the Microsoft
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.720]   corporate culture, they're going to have to get rid of more
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.640]   than just Steven Sinofsky, right?
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.960]   I think it'll be interesting to see if a warmer, fazier,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.400]   Microsoft is as good as Sinofsky was at shipping stuff
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.040]   on time because in the old days, Microsoft had a reputation
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.320]   for blowing its deadlines by a year or two.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.000]   And with Sinofsky, the stuff got out there.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.520]   Right.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.960]   Well, he did.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.480]   That's the thing.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.280]   He did a great job.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.200]   And Windows 7, I think, affects most of the things
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.240]   that were wrong with Vista, which
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.000]   were pretty remarkable accomplishment.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.280]   Is it too early, Matthew Ingram, to say that Windows 8
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.920]   is a flop?
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.440]   I don't-- I think it's too early to say it's a flop.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.600]   I think it's not too early to say it's not a huge runaway
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.800]   success.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.520]   And there's certainly quite a bit of skepticism out there.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.960]   But I think it might be too early to call it an outright flop.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.600]   It's somewhere between the Wii U and the Google Q.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.000]   Well, that's not a good place to be.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   That's a fairly large talk now.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.840]   Large spectrum.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.400]   Net applications, which monitors internet use, I guess,
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.280]   of browsers, of different operating systems, says,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.560]   by this time in 2009, Windows 7 had 3.6% of the market.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.240]   Windows 8 is just 1%.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.360]   That's such a small number, though.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.640]   They've got to be.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.600]   But people were desperate to get off of Vista.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.480]   I don't think they were desperate to get off of Windows 7.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.600]   It's quite good.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.800]   And Windows 8, even if it's good--
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.120]   I mean, it's a big leap.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.320]   You're leaving something familiar for something unfamiliar.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.000]   And I think it's very reasonable to think it over.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.320]   I really think it's going to be months or possibly years
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.560]   before it's entirely clear whether this huge bet
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.720]   that Microsoft is making was a good idea or not.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.640]   I know, as both of you guys are using iPads,
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.320]   what are you using Matthew right in front of you?
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.720]   Is it just a regular-- it's probably a computer, right?
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's a desktop.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.440]   It's running Ubuntu.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.880]   Oh, god.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.080]   So nobody here is using Windows anyway.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.360]   You know, I actually went out shopping yesterday,
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.400]   because I'm in the market for a new laptop.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.120]   And I went to Best Buy and Office Max.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.920]   I'm thinking I want to get a Windows 8 computer,
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.560]   but there's just so few options out there.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.520]   I want something like a MacBook Air,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.080]   but with Windows 8 on it.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.640]   They'll be because some really good choices.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.560]   ASUS is a nice one.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   They are.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.720]   I mean, Windows 8 is out.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.360]   And there were like three models that I could choose from.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.960]   So that's--
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   Yeah, that is a big difference, because in the past,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.080]   Windows 7 came out, you'd have all these new--
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   Well, tons of interesting machines were announced,
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.360]   but there have been some stories saying
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.560]   that it's surprisingly hard to find them.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.080]   That's weird.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.920]   I wonder why that is.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.400]   Is that maybe the OEMs being a little slow to the market,
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.600]   because they're mad at Microsoft over surface?
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.560]   Well, there are a number of theories, one of which
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.400]   is that Intel has been slow with the chip they need for Windows
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.800]   8 tablets, so Intel denies that.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.840]   That is a struggle that's been going on as long
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.240]   as I've been covering tech between hardware and software,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.400]   and particularly between Microsoft and Intel.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.960]   I can remember going to interview Andy Grove almost 20
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.920]   years ago and him bitching about Bill Gates not
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.600]   keeping Windows up.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.760]   We're making 32-bit processors, and these clowns are still
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.440]   doing 16-bit Windows.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.400]   I mean, it has always been that way.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.600]   One way or the other-- software, blame and hardware,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.840]   or vice versa.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.320]   Paul Alini is retiring in May.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.440]   I don't know if that's Jermaine.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.600]   He's the CEO of Intel.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.440]   Who do you get to run that?
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.240]   Oh, I'd hate to be there.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.640]   I don't know.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.440]   That's a tough--
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.200]   Do they stick to ARM looking their lunch, right?
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.960]   I mean, the ARM processor is sort of like this hippie co-op,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.160]   but the ARM the company is very small.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.320]   Yeah, but everybody's using ARM processors.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.080]   They may be making them with Samsung.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.800]   So everybody's eating their lunch.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.960]   Yeah, it's more like that.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.120]   There is no ARM.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.400]   Hand in hand with ARM.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.280]   In the past, Intel has always been run by people
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.240]   who have been at Intel for 20, 30, 40 years.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.120]   Newegg, a senior executive at Newegg,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.240]   says the Windows launch is not the explosion we had planned for,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.840]   but slow and steady.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.320]   If I'm buying a new computer, I think I'd buy Windows 8,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.600]   because the desktop is still there.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.000]   Windows 7 is still under the hood.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.960]   It's just a new start screen, really, right?
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.080]   Yeah, but they kind of poked you in the eye
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.240]   by taking away your start menu, which I think was--
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.740]   Mm-hmm.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.880]   --in retrospect.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.080]   I think people will conclude that was not such a great idea.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.640]   I wonder, though, if more people--
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.200]   if people who are using Windows phones
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.880]   would be more open to that, say, than someone
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.200]   just buying a computer--
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.760]   because they're already using the Metro interface.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.320]   Or as the--
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.800]   Yeah, because--
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.720]   --as smart called it, the Metroid Prime interface.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.960]   Which, by the way, the chatroom said, I'd buy that.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.440]   Yeah, it's totally-- it's a great game.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.760]   Lost opportunity.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.440]   I do know that my daughter, for example,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.480]   and some of her friends, they're 14, 15,
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.080]   they're actually quite interested in Windows phones.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.960]   Like, they want them.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.880]   They like the look of them.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.120]   They like the look of the interface,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.800]   which I was surprised by.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.160]   I think those ads, maybe.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.320]   And I also-- when you look at a Lumia 920, for instance,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.000]   which is not, in my opinion, the best Windows 8 phone,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.160]   it's beautiful.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.440]   I've been using that and the HTC 8X since the announcement.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.240]   Do you have a preference?
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.920]   Because the 8X is the one I was looking at.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.560]   I mean, the 920 is nice, except it's huge and thick.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.120]   It is big.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.400]   It's a nicely made phone.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.960]   It has that no key ass validity to it.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.560]   The 8X is probably more appealing overall,
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.640]   just in terms of the size.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.360]   Two young girls.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.440]   What about the camera, though?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.560]   The Nokia camera is very interesting.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.360]   The low light performance seems to be quite good.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.120]   They both have nice cameras.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.760]   And the big issue is apps.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.200]   Microsoft says that--
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.800]   I think it has--
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.720]   20,000.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.040]   46 of the top 50.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.720]   I was unclear, and this is part of the problem Microsoft has.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.240]   When they said we have 20,000 apps,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.360]   did they mean in the RT store, the Pro store, or the phone
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:44.800]   store?
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.960]   I think that's Windows 8 apps.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.280]   Windows Phone has something like 100,000 apps.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:49.760]   100,000.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.800]   120,000.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   But not-- but the 8 apps are different from--
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.280]   they're distinct from 7 apps.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.760]   You can run 7 Windows 7, phone 7 apps on 8.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.120]   But they're not Windows 8 apps.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:00.960]   That's right.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.000]   You see the problem that Microsoft faces.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.960]   It's very confusing.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.040]   I think consumers walk in.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.160]   They see all three of them have the same start screen.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.960]   And the impression is strong that you're going to-- oh,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.800]   this is a unified thing.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.160]   And an 8.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.400]   I'm confused.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.440]   So Windows 8 apps--
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.240]   Metro apps.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.400]   Windows 8 app store.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.160]   That's 20,000.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.720]   But is it RT or--
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.560]   I think it's Windows 8.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.360]   And generally speaking, Windows 8 apps--
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.000]   I mean, they can be compiled to run in a Windows RT.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.280]   And generally speaking, they are.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.240]   But I don't think it's an absolute given
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.280]   that they'll show up in the Windows RT store.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:39.800]   Steve--
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   If I understand this correctly, which I probably don't.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.640]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.440]   I don't think anybody--
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.960]   Steve Bomber described the sales of Windows--
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.000]   Windows RT tablet's surface as fantastic.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.480]   I do not think that word means what he thinks it may be.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:54.960]   Fantastic.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.120]   Well, I think you think that word.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.560]   I think that's the reason about that.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.120]   It was a bad translation in a French publication.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.960]   So this was what I'm saying they were modest.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.460]   Right.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.760]   But he was talking about distribution.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.920]   But he was not being full of ego.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.760]   We're being modest about this.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.240]   Right.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.680]   That they were only available in certain stores.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.040]   They weren't rolling it out everywhere.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.160]   He's saying that was modest.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.800]   But the bad translations said sales were modest.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.400]   But it is fascinating, at least around me.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.200]   Basically, almost every ad I see in the subway is for surface.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.440]   But the thing is only for sale in a few dozen retail stores
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.320]   in the world.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.560]   Mostly Microsoft stores.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.800]   And the ads don't say that.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.600]   So I have to think that people are going into Best Buy
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.520]   and asking about the surface thing and not finding it there.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.640]   Ad duplex.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.600]   Another-- so many of these little companies
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.680]   that measure this stuff.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.320]   And who knows what their methodology is.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.640]   But they say that the surface is winning in the early race
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.680]   to be the most popular Windows 8 or RT device.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.160]   This is based on ads from the company's network that
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.720]   are showing up on these platforms.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   Again, these are not-- I don't know
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.080]   how good these numbers are.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.960]   The surface is number one tablet and notebook.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.520]   Nokia Lumia phones, mostly older phones.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.600]   The Windows 7 phones and the 710 are showing an early lead
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.000]   within Windows Phone.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.680]   But Windows Phone 8, they say, captures about 4%
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.360]   of the available Windows Phone views.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.440]   And that was in just the first week.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.680]   I think you might be right.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.360]   I think the breakout hit might be the Windows Phone, Matthew.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.840]   Maybe your daughters are a bellwether.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.520]   Well, it's interesting what they're
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.080]   interested in about the phone.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.760]   They don't care about Windows versus Apple or the technology.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.960]   They're interested in the interface
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.200]   and how it shows them at a glance.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.920]   All the things their friends have done
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.120]   on any social network, all in one view.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.840]   That's kind of like-- it's a lively interface.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.560]   It's kind of compelling with the tiles are rotating.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.280]   And yeah, I think-- yeah.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.680]   I can see why that would be attractive to teenage girls.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.920]   And Magpies.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   I like it.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.120]   I mean, it's just a snippet.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.400]   It's not like everything about your friends in one glance.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   It's slowly rotating through all that stuff, right?
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.440]   Microsoft could play that up in their ad campaign.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.160]   They do the thing?
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.680]   Phone for little girls?
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.040]   No, they don't play that up.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.240]   They did that with the Ken, and it was a flop.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.080]   Google has those Chrome commercials
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.320]   where it's like the Chrome--
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.880]   Phone for dogs is for everyone including babies and dogs.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.480]   Dogs and babies.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.800]   I don't get that at all.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.640]   We're talking about the week's tech news,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.280]   and I have to admit, I don't know anything,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.320]   because I just got off a boat minutes ago.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.720]   But fortunately, we have three of the best tech journalists
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.240]   here to help me understand what happens.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.320]   So you guys, if you-- just chime in,
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.120]   if there's a story you think was a big story,
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.880]   I'll start with you, Matthew, when we get back from this word
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.800]   from stamps.com.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.280]   I'm a big fan of stamps.com.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.760]   This is the way we do our mailing,
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   because who wants to go to the post office?
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.800]   Especially this time of year, Christmas time.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.760]   There's all these people in line getting stamps,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.360]   and it's just slow going.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.680]   You don't have to worry about that,
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.920]   because you have a little stamp machine right now
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.080]   in your own home or office.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.280]   It's your computer and your printer.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.480]   No special links.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.560]   No postage made or needed.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.960]   It just stamps.com.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.640]   And you can print your postage when you need it anytime.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.520]   Not just print out stamps, but print right on the envelope.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.240]   Print out all the information for a package.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.560]   If you're doing international mailing,
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.080]   it'll even print out the forms you need.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.720]   And then the mail carrier comes to you and picks it up.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.960]   I know we have a lot of listeners outside the US.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.920]   This is US only.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.200]   This is for printing US postage.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.360]   You'll have to inquire with your own postal service
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.480]   about what they have.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.880]   But we're lucky here in the US.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.240]   We've got stamps.com.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.000]   Over 2 billion letters and packages
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.520]   have been sent to date via stamps.com.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.520]   And now I want you to get on the stamps.com bandwagon.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.000]   Stamps.com has a special no risk trial offer for you.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:49.840]   You see that?
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   No, don't do that.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.400]   It says it's an $80 value.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.240]   Click on the radio microfiberics.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.840]   Click here on the upper right hand corner.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.520]   And then enter promo code TWIT and press go.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.560]   And let's see $80.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.520]   $110.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:05.840]   Look at that.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.200]   $55 in free postage.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.640]   A free digital scale.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.800]   You just pay shipping and handling.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.880]   It's about $5.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.560]   $5 supply kit and a four week trial of stamps.com.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.640]   It really--
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.880]   stamps is a bad name, to be honest.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.480]   Because it's not about printing stamps.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480]   You kind of get that feeling.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.280]   Really is about handling all your mailing needs,
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.200]   even things like automatically sending emails
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.480]   to the recipient saying it's on the way.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.560]   If you're an eBay or Amazon or Etsy seller, PayPal seller,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.280]   this is fantastic for you for your fulfillment.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.520]   It turns you into a fulfillment house easily, simply
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.280]   affordably stamps.com.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.040]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.520]   So this was completely out of the blue.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.840]   And I want to understand this a little bit better.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:58.160]   Google and Dish Network offering wireless internet.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.760]   Matthew, can you explain this to me?
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.400]   What's going on here?
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.000]   Does anybody have--
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.600]   I haven't actually been following that one,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.480]   but I think it sounds fascinating.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.160]   I mean, it's surprising to me that Google has sort of waited
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.640]   this long to do something like that.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.000]   I think there's a market opportunity there,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.640]   whether that's going to work or not.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.760]   I don't know.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.400]   This is definitely planning something.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.840]   I think that the Google part is not official.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.840]   But Dish wants to launch a wireless service.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.800]   Using their satellites?
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.720]   I mean, because we--
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.600]   Direct TV did this, and it's crappy.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.640]   I mean, no, they--
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.720]   well, I mean, Dish wants to do basically a phone service.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   They're getting spectrum to do it.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.400]   So is it-- but is it towers?
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.840]   You mean, there'd be like a cell phone service?
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.280]   I believe Dish wants to become a cell phone company,
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:44.840]   essentially.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.680]   Boy, that's Charlie.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.720]   He is the ecostar guy.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.040]   Yeah, he'll-- I mean, he's--
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.680]   He's ambitious.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.320]   He'll do anything.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:51.840]   He'll do anything.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.240]   He'll irritate anybody.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:53.960]   He'll compete with anybody.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.640]   Charlie Ergin, who's the head of ecostar, which
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.400]   is the dish parent.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.320]   Now, where he's a madman.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.080]   So why does Google get--
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.440]   have you been covering this?
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.960]   Why does Google get tied up in this?
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.480]   I've been following it a bit, and we've
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   done some reporting on it.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.920]   I mean, it seems as though they're talking.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.120]   The talks aren't advanced in any way,
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.000]   and it's not necessarily a Google cellular network dish.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.480]   They would partner with Dish.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:22.960]   Right.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.600]   And Google has their own fiber thing.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.120]   I mean, Google tried to buy a spectrum.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.840]   The notion of--
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.200]   I don't know how hard they tried.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.640]   They didn't try all that hard, but the notion
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.240]   that they're wanting to be a phone company has been around
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.560]   for an awfully long time.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.200]   I wanted them to buy it.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.360]   I think a lot of people like the idea of them doing it,
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.800]   because people like the idea of--
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.440]   Somebody started up essentially competing
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.000]   with Verizon and AT&T.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.920]   Somebody's not an incumbent.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.960]   Although increasingly Google is.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.080]   So I don't know if Google's the white knight we thought
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.160]   they were going to be.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:56.000]   So this comes from 9 to 5, Google.com.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.400]   Google plans to roll out a service by mid to late 2013,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.560]   next year, which would be voice and SMS over VoIP.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:12.360]   Probably Google Voice is the back end for that.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.680]   So maybe they would be the provider.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.920]   But Google is the infrastructure and the data.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.080]   And Google is the user interface layer.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.200]   I don't know.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.600]   I wouldn't say this is a go.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.400]   The Wall Street Journal said they were in talks,
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.440]   but that they could amount to nothing, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.600]   But the part about DISH, I think,
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.200]   is official.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   Is it their intention to try to do this?
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.360]   Well, nothing wrong with that.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.120]   Anything that competes with the incumbents
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.280]   and in the wireless service, as you said, Harry,
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:53.000]   Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint, that's all I need to say.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.720]   Nobody's happy.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.760]   Nobody likes any of them.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.920]   I mean, DISH is looking to clear some regulatory hurdles
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.680]   so that they would be able to do this, a smartphone, mobile
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.120]   service.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.080]   And they want to do LTE for everything.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.160]   Voice over LTE, everything.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.440]   Yeah, I think that sounds about right.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.640]   And that's the way that a lot of the bigger carriers are going
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.280]   as well.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.840]   They want to be able to carry voice as data.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.080]   Yeah, everybody has LTE entirely.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.640]   That's the direction everyone is.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.440]   They're not doing it now.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.640]   And that's why Verizon, you can't use data and voice
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.160]   at the same time, because they're separate now.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.320]   So the Washington Post says Julius Genakowski, the chairman
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.240]   of the FCC, approved the DISH LTE, or put his weight
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.000]   behind approving it, which the commissioners have to approve
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   of.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.600]   But DISH says it's unhappy with Genakowski's proposal,
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.920]   because it puts too many restrictions on what power levels.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.240]   They want to use a 40 megahertz chunk of the satellite
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.600]   spectrum, which I guess they already
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.120]   own of the 2 gigahertz band.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.640]   But Charlie Erghen told the Post, telling us
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.560]   to lower our power levels, cripples our ability.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.440]   He is-- he is.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.520]   I love Charlie Erghen.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.560]   I've actually-- I met him.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.280]   I did it.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   He has a Charlie chatter, a show on DISH.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.280]   I was on.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.520]   And he's a character.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.280]   He's a smart guy, an engineer.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.840]   And he's kind of like an old school mogul.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.280]   We want to enter the wireless business.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.880]   We have $6 billion more.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.400]   We want to spend on building out this business.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.520]   But the FCC could make it extremely risky.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.360]   So this is back and forth, obviously,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.560]   to get more concessions from the FCC.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.520]   Interesting.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.280]   We shall see.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   What else happened?
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.360]   Droh--
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:43.880]   Well, there was--
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   Go ahead, Matthew.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.320]   You give me a story, please.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.560]   I was going to say HP and Autonomy--
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.040]   I don't know if you want to talk about that.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.160]   Oh, poor HP.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.520]   I did see those results.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.240]   So Autonomy was cooking the books.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.920]   What was going on?
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.840]   This is the company that Leo Apothekar, the former CEO
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.280]   of HP, when he announced we're getting out of the business.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.960]   We're not going to make computers anymore.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.280]   We're going into services, and we're
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   going to buy for what was it?
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.160]   $6 billion--
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.960]   I'm huge about it.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.360]   $11 billion.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.760]   We're going to buy a British company,
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.520]   Autonomy that does consulting services, and then which they did,
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.360]   right?
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.680]   And then Leo gets booted, and oh, we're
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.400]   going to make PCs after all, make women's.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.720]   Oh, we're going to make PCs after all.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.080]   But they've already bought this company.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.560]   So what happened, Matthew?
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.040]   Well, you know, he said she said sort of thing.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.680]   I mean, Meg Whitman is saying, you know,
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.280]   this was that they were misled effectively.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.800]   And so they paid way too much.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.840]   And so they're taking a $9 billion write down or something.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.240]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.840]   I think Autonomy is saying, you know,
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.960]   our bookkeeping might have been a little aggressive.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.080]   So it's--
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.720]   HP said they lied about their finances, basically.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.880]   Pretty much, yeah.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.640]   And the founder denies that.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.560]   Oh, wow.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.640]   But even back then, people were startled by how much HP
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.320]   was willing to pay for this company, which
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.040]   does make good software.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.400]   But it might just might not have been worth $11 billion.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.920]   Yeah, they paid a huge premium over earnings for this company.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.480]   And that was a deal that, you know,
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.720]   Apothecure seemed to lead, but was also approved by the board.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.560]   Including Meg Whitman, who's running the board.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.840]   So Meg, you said yes to it.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.200]   Larry Ellison, like he issued a press release at the time
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.440]   saying we looked at buying Autonomy,
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.040]   but it's just not worth that much money.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.840]   He's just laughing right now.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.800]   Larry thought Leo Apothecure was an idiot, right?
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.480]   And then--
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:45.960]   Pretty much.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.240]   Larry thinks everybody's an idiot.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.160]   He thinks everybody's an idiot.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.480]   And he thought that HP was were idiots for any bit of Mark
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.160]   Hurd.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.800]   Right.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.280]   Yeah, well, he was a Mark Hurd fan.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:56.560]   Right.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.600]   And HP fired Mark Hurd over a sex scandal.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   Larry hired him.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.480]   Have they rehired him?
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.520]   No, Oracle hired him.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:06.840]   That's right.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.760]   He's a president of Oracle.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   He's a president of Oracle.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.480]   It just seems like HP, you know, there--
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.120]   I remember someone said of a bank in Canada at one point
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.920]   that kept having to take write-downs.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.120]   They're the bank most likely to walk into a sharpened stick.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.320]   You know, they just can't seem to do anything without just
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.080]   screwing out.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.160]   So it's not just autonomy.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.480]   They took a write-down for EDS as well.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.720]   And an $900 million hit for a palm.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.160]   Remember, that didn't work out so well.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.880]   So it's a total of--
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:41.800]   hold your breath-- $17 billion in write-downs
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   in the last three months.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.960]   Yeah, and if their core business
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.760]   has in their latest results, none of them
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.960]   look great at the moment.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.640]   It's scary writing, yeah.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.360]   PCs, printers.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.960]   So was Leo Apotheca right?
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.400]   Should they have gotten out of this business?
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.960]   Of course, Meg Whitman just not leading the parade.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.120]   Well, for Meg as having to deal with decisions made by--
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.560]   By her?
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.480]   --the other folks before her on the board.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.960]   But the board-- you know, 10 of the 11 directors approved it,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.440]   right?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.040]   So it was--
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   I don't--
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   The CFO got up and said, I cannot support this acquisition.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.840]   And so Leo wasn't happy with her.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.080]   But we heard you later, Leo laughed and she hung around.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:27.600]   Oh.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.720]   And the CFO was not pleased with the idea.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.840]   And I've been reading--
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.680]   foolish me, I've been reading People magazine,
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.000]   hoping for better gossip.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.840]   This is good stuff.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.560]   This is almost as good as John McAfee story, which we're not
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.840]   going to do because it's not a tech story.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.560]   But what is going on in Belize?
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.440]   That is crazy stuff.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.560]   Unless you're interested in bath salts technology.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.760]   All I could say is read John's blog, the Hinterland--
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.080]   it's called the Hinterland blog.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.440]   And it's great that a guy who's on the run, you know,
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.600]   from the military, supposedly, and is in hiding,
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.600]   is writing a blog.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.360]   He's blogging.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.160]   I just want that fascinating.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.760]   Don't you have other better things to do?
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.040]   I don't know, like come up with a new disguise or--
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.840]   I don't know.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.200]   It's who is McAfee.com, if you want to--
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.360]   He said he pre-wrote a year's worth of content.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.800]   So in case he runs into any trouble,
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.680]   the blog will go on.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.000]   He's got some post-scheduled, like, top 10 reasons
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.440]   why you should, you know, play.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.880]   And there's a graph novel that we're not
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.080]   about as adventures, too.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.280]   Wow.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.160]   Yeah, there is-- right here, there's a picture of him
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.240]   on the front of the blog.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.680]   Chad Esli, who is a cartoonist, is doing a graphic novel called,
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.560]   called the Hinterland, the true story
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.400]   of my unusual friendship with the anti-virus king.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.080]   An intel, which now owns McAfee, anti-virus,
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.000]   you told me Harry has quicked it just about any knowledge.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.360]   Yeah, they say that we haven't had anything to do with this guy
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.680]   since 1994.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.440]   Has it been that long?
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.120]   Well, Intel only bought it fairly recently.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.920]   But he sold-- he left up--
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   He had nothing to do.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.480]   --how he did.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.960]   '94, wow.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.280]   Emerged with some other company that became network associates.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.160]   And they actually changed her name.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.840]   They got rid of the McAfee in their name.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.360]   That's right.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.920]   And then a few years later, they put the McAfee back
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.040]   into their name, which they possibly have come--
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   Regret.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.800]   --come to undergrad.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.200]   Network associates.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.600]   That's right.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.280]   They're network associates.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.320]   I was just reading in Wikipedia before the show.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.240]   He was at Lockheed and got a copy of a virus,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.120]   a Pakistani of brain virus, and reverse engineered it
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.840]   and wrote an anti-virus tool and it kind of
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.920]   gotten to the business that way.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.760]   Well, I don't know what the story is, so I'm not going to--
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.000]   I don't even know what--
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   I have no note, and it wouldn't even know where to begin
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.920]   on that one.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.920]   Matthew Ingram is here from gigaohm.com.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.720]   Got anything coming up?
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.880]   You want to plug any great conferences in the near future?
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.400]   We've got some coming in the spring, nothing that soon,
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.920]   but coming in March and April.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.360]   I think OM is off to Paris for Le Webb by now, right?
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.680]   I know you're not going there, huh?
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.520]   I am not.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   Are you going to that, Leo?
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.440]   I was invited.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.680]   In the last two years, I love it.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.200]   It's my favorite conference because it's Paris.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.120]   Yeah, I've never been.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.080]   Yeah, but I just got back.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.480]   I really couldn't say, oh, yeah, I'll be here for a week.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.240]   And then I'll see you.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.480]   I'm going to Paris.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.800]   So no, I'm not going to go this year.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.840]   I feel bad, but because it's fine.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.760]   You know who goes every year?
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.720]   Marissa Meyer, because that's where she got engaged.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.440]   And this would be an interesting year to talk to Marissa Meyer.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.320]   At Le Webb?
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.080]   Or in Paris.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.800]   In Paris at Le Webb.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.960]   So she told Le Week, she says, I'm going every year
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.120]   because this is where me and my husband got engaged
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.560]   and they go together and it's very romantic.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.080]   I guess Sarah Lane is going with MG Seagler.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.920]   So we'll have some coverage.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.840]   Of course they are.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.600]   Yes, of course they are.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.960]   Everybody who's everybody is going to me,
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.560]   new Matthew Harry, but everybody else.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.600]   My path photos will be filled with MG and Sarah's shots.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.200]   I know.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.480]   I know.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.280]   Isn't that funny?
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.600]   OK, so you follow on path as well.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.400]   I know for some-- the people you follow on path
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.200]   and it's a small handful.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.120]   And not most people don't post anymore.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.600]   You know, path has kind of become kind of like everything
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.400]   else, something--
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.080]   Ghost town?
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.440]   Yeah, ghost town.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.120]   But the people who post, they're very active.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.640]   And it's like you just feel like it's a travel log.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.240]   I'm watching Sarah Lane, Kevin Rose.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.400]   You're like a travel log of their life.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.440]   Go buy.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.480]   I've been on Windows Phone, so I haven't been on path
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.320]   for a few weeks.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.080]   How do you survive?
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.680]   In Instagram, I miss a lot.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.800]   Path I've managed to do without.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.760]   But there's always one.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.560]   Instagram.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.240]   How's the Facebook experience on Windows Phone?
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.440]   Is it pretty good?
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.040]   Well, I don't think the Facebook experience is very good
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.800]   in any mobile device, but it's no worse on Windows Phone
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.520]   than on others.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.600]   No worse.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.240]   Hi, Prince.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.640]   Path is beautiful.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.960]   Is there anything else you miss on Windows Phone?
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.880]   Instagram is the big one.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   There are some--
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   Google Plus.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   No.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.880]   Google Plus is my new share.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.360]   Is there a good Twitter client?
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.960]   Yeah, there are several of them.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.520]   There's one called Meadow, which I've been using.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.320]   There's a great four-square client called Fourth and Mayor.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.840]   But not an official four-square client.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.000]   There's also an official one.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.200]   The unofficial one is even better.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.800]   And better.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.560]   There was a bit of a controversy with Twitter and Windows.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   The Windows client tweet row, I think it was called?
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.560]   Yeah, tweet row.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.560]   I use tweet row on the--
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.560]   Random.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   --on the API limit.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   Oh, boy.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.680]   And Twitter basically said, yeah, sorry about that.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680]   See you.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.520]   So long.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.480]   Wow.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.400]   Thanks for playing.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.880]   What is going on there?
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.000]   Seriously.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Twitter is--
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.920]   They are taking control of their ecosystem.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.200]   And they don't have a Windows 8 client, yeah, which I think
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.920]   is the major factor.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.520]   Mark-- not Mark.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.240]   Nick Bilton, who was here the last tweet before I left,
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.280]   November 4, is writing a book about Twitter.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.600]   And I can't even imagine trying to keep up with everything.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.720]   The changes, the new business model, the business model
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.880]   of the week.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.360]   I don't know how you'd write a book about it.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.080]   But he says, no, no, it's great.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.520]   There's plenty to talk about.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.840]   Lots to write about.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.920]   There is no doubt about that.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.520]   There's lots to write about.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.020]   All right.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.660]   We're going to take a break.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.420]   Come back with more Matthew Ingram of GigaOME from time.com,
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.460]   Harry McCracken, and the Technologizer blog.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:51.180]   And from Business-- Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.060]   I'm not going to do the droopy talk to you.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:58.420]   I ran into somebody on the boat who said, every time I see
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.560]   Bloomberg Business Week, I think, Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.080]   That's great.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.340]   You're having a look at it for them.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.420]   Except it's in their head.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:05.780]   So that's not so bad.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.700]   As long as they're thinking it, right?
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.460]   Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.180]   I'm going to do this next commercialist droopy dog deal.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.340]   No, I won't do that to Ford.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.580]   Port Ford.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.300]   So I decided I'm making an official.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.860]   I'm going to trade in the Mustang, the 2010 Mustang.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.380]   I know it's a heartbreaker.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.260]   But I found a car I love even more.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.780]   And it's got all the features that I want.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:35.820]   It's the new fusion, the Ford Fusion, the plug-in hybrid.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.180]   And I'll tell you a couple of the things that
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.940]   kind of put me over the top.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.740]   Of course, it's got a sink in my Ford Touch, the stuff
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.140]   that I require.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.500]   But now they're putting in these more and more of these features,
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.020]   these features to help you drive.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:52.300]   So there's a narrative here somewhere.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.700]   I would like to write this book.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.340]   There's a narrative in here somewhere.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.580]   Because I remember talking to--
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.240]   I went to the Silicon Valley when they
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.420]   offered their Silicon Valley office a few months ago.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.260]   I went there.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.980]   And they said, we see the car as a platform.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.180]   You know, like Windows is a platform.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.180]   It's a platform we want people to develop for.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.740]   So what we're doing is putting sensors in this car.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.140]   So there's all sorts of information with an API
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.660]   so you can access the sensors.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.700]   And then people will be able to write apps on their smartphones
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.020]   that will interact with--
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.580]   so they've got these ideas of the kind of what
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.780]   the modern 21st century vehicle would be.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.180]   And this is an example.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.140]   So they put a camera in the front.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.900]   There's one in the back as you back up.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.460]   But there's one in the front that you don't have access.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.300]   I don't think you have access to.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.220]   A front-facing camera.
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.900]   And all it does is watch where the lanes are.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.780]   Watch the lines go by.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   And it determines if you're on course.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.740]   Here it is.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.980]   So if you-- now, if you put in the turn signal, it disables it.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.660]   So if you say, I'm going to change lanes, it doesn't do this.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.500]   But if you drift into the lane, the system
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.660]   will vibrate the steering wheel.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.700]   Say like that.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.260]   Like you hit the spot starts.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.620]   And then if you don't do anything,
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.220]   it will apply pressure on the steering wheel
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.940]   to help you get back in the lane.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.820]   This is wild.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.060]   This is a camera in the car that's doing this.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.060]   Very sweet.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.140]   So you can even see the guide on the My Fort Touch.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.860]   You can see the guide about where you are in the lanes.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.980]   This is their idea.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.500]   I don't know if the idea is going towards an autonomous vehicle.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.260]   I think that what they told me is,
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.860]   we think you need a driver.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.260]   But what we want to do is use this smart technology
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.580]   to help the driver be a better driver.
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.900]   So it's information.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.060]   They also have adaptive cruise control, which I really like.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.500]   Can you show the video for that?
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.860]   So the adaptive cruise control--
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.660]   now, not only do you have a camera in the front,
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.780]   you've got forward-looking radar in this 2013 fusion.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.060]   And it scans the road.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.900]   And so you got your cruise control.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.140]   You're set for 55 or 65 or whatever.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.740]   But when it sees traffic ahead, it slows you down.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.220]   It also has a collision warning that
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.900]   will alert you with flashing red lights, not on the dashboard,
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:02.180]   but on the windshield if there's a potential crash ahead.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.100]   So it goes bloop, bloop, bloop.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.220]   And it's heads-- I'm telling you, they're
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.340]   going to the heads-up display.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.740]   I'm convinced.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.540]   You could find out more about the lane keeping system
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.260]   and the adaptive cruise control on-- here it is--
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:12.980]   on the website.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.940]   This is where we're getting these videos.
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.100]   This is Ford.com/technology.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.900]   So it slows down.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.580]   So you don't even have to adjust the cruise control.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.500]   It just goes, OK, yeah, it's traffic.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.900]   I love that.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.660]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.380]   Or go to your Ford dealer, test driver.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.460]   I don't think that that fusion is out yet,
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.860]   but it's going to be soon.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.700]   What, Chad?
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.780]   I saw you pull the microphone.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.260]   I don't know.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.700]   I pulled the microphone down just to sit-- just to say,
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.660]   I don't know.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.700]   I was getting it ready just in case.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.780]   I had an answer for you.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.260]   But I did.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.460]   I wonder if I should advertise the Mustang
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.540]   when I sell it on the air.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.500]   I should.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.940]   You put it on the air?
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.860]   I could autograph the gas cap.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.420]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:37:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.700]   You think I have more money for that than if I used to like
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.420]   Craigslist?
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:03.980]   Maybe less.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.980]   If you autograph it.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.900]   Maybe that would lower the value.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.580]   Sell it to a guy.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.460]   Why is there writing on the car?
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.300]   This was a great car until you wrote all over it.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.420]   Dagomar said raffle it.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.460]   Yeah?
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.940]   That's, I think, illegal.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:19.740]   Well, we'd have to--
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.020]   Yeah, we'd have to do legal stuff.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.100]   If you give away over $250 worth of stuff.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.740]   We could establish the company in New Caledonia.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.740]   Ah.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.860]   And in the jurisdiction-- because they have casinos
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   everywhere you go.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.380]   Exactly.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.060]   We could use the Google strategy of--
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:36.460]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.580]   Certain companies and different--
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.820]   I should funnel all the money into the Caledonia.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.020]   And then I'll--
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.380]   So where did it go?
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:43.940]   Exactly.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.860]   We'll twit Dutch sandwich?
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.860]   Dutch sandwich.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.860]   Exactly.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.140]   What is it?
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.140]   The French Reach around?
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.860]   There's another name for that.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.220]   Nice.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:51.900]   That can't be it.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:52.420]   That's not it.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.420]   That's not it.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:38:59.780]   Or Belize.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.500]   There's always Belize.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.100]   I hear they're very welcoming to entrepreneurs there.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.900]   After years of giving employees iPhones, Facebook--
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.980]   engineers are saying, please, let us taste Android.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.220]   Do you droid food?
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.140]   Switch today.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.180]   They actually have posters at Facebook saying,
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.500]   switch to Android.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.300]   But as you just said, Harry, the experience
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.340]   is crap on all platforms.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.940]   I think the actually the iOS experience
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.900]   has gotten better, hasn't it?
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.100]   Now that it's not HTML5 anymore.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.940]   But I mean, I'm struck by the fact that basically, wherever
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:37.540]   you go in the Bay Area, the iPhone has--
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.740]   as close to 100% market penetration
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.780]   as you'll ever see anywhere when I'm on the subway
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.500]   in the morning, it's often 100% in whatever car I'm in.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.700]   And so it's not surprising that at Facebook,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.700]   it must be extremely high.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.060]   And it's really hard to build a great Android app.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.420]   If you're at a company where people don't really use Android--
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.980]   so I think it makes total sense for Facebook
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.140]   to try to encourage the people who build this stuff.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:00.660]   Here's another.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.140]   Here's the devices that are out there.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:02.700]   Here's another--
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.140]   I wonder--
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.060]   apparently, these posters are just
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.300]   bringing up all over Facebook.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.500]   Here come the Androids.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.940]   And there's a graph, device shipments.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.580]   And Android's spiking and iPhones leveling out.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.980]   Switch today, helpdesk@fb.com.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.140]   They'll give you an Android phone.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.820]   They have to beg people to switch.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.260]   I think they're basically just looking at market share
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.260]   numbers and thinking, we've got to be open to this.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.140]   Market, I know friends and acquaintances
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.860]   are thinking about Android.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.180]   They're looking at the devices or they're mad at Apple
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.860]   or they're sick of the walled garden or whatever.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.420]   I think it's increasing.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.420]   Well, now Facebook has a better relationship with Apple
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.420]   than they do with Google.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.500]   So I think this is just purely a numbers
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.580]   game that they don't want to ignore a platform that
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.460]   has so many customers using it.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:50.860]   Right.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.180]   That makes sense.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.660]   I like the bug reporting tool.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.740]   They call it Rage Shake.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.700]   So you have an early version.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.180]   Whichever platform you're on, they
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.660]   force you to have the latest beta, the early version.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:09.220]   And if it crashes, it employs violently shake their phone.
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.140]   And it automatically logs the current state
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:16.660]   and sends details to the bug squashers.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.060]   I think everything should have that.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.500]   Apparently the Google+ team does that too.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.740]   And now they say they have access to end users.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.260]   Has anybody done a Rage Shake on Google+,
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.660]   I think everything we use today.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.460]   It's good.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.700]   Wouldn't that-- it just feels good.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.540]   It feels right.
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.620]   The iPhone has that shake to undo,
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.820]   which a lot of times I'll activate by accident.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.220]   Just like putting it back in my pocket.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.020]   Well, that's not good.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:45.980]   Shake to undo.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.140]   I didn't even know it had that.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:47.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.460]   Like undo what?
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.460]   Anything?
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   Like text.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.900]   You enter text and you want to undo.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.780]   Yeah?
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.380]   You got a good shake.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.820]   Very vigorous.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.020]   I'll have to try that.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:06.660]   So MySpace, while I was gone, came up with another plan.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.780]   Now Justin Timberlake, the picture appears everywhere
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.660]   when you talk about MySpace.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.700]   But how much does he have to do with this?
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.900]   Is he really running MySpace now?
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.220]   He is an investor, I know.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.060]   News Corp bought it and sold it last summer to--
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:23.980]   oh my god.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.820]   So News Corp bought it for $580 million six years ago.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.740]   They sold it to specific media last summer for $35 million.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.820]   There's a write off.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.060]   Specific media is a private company
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:40.100]   owned by the Vanderhoek family.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.420]   And then they took new funding from the people
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.820]   like Justin Timberlake.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.180]   But I think they're using him as the poster boy.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.180]   So get this.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:52.100]   Since December 2011, MySpace traffic is up 36%.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.020]   How could that be?
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.420]   From a relatively tiny base.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.380]   But they did a redesign.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.380]   It doesn't look as ugly.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.140]   It is actually not bad looking.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.660]   Looks like Pinterest.
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.540]   Right?
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.420]   Still going to lose another $25 million this year.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.460]   So they have a new plan.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.100]   The new plan is to raise $50 million.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.260]   That's my plan as well.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.420]   Then move to Belize.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.540]   No.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.260]   That's my plan.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.660]   They're planning to raise $50 million.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.420]   And then take it-- they're pitching this
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.940]   as an alternative to Pandora and Spotify.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.500]   $10 million will go to marketing.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.620]   $15 to $25 million to licensing deals with the music labels.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.940]   $15 to $25 million, which by the way,
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.380]   this adds up to more than $50.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.380]   But OK, we'll be reserved for general working capital.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.900]   And then we'll go to Belize.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.660]   They're going to run right against a buzzsaw
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.540]   called Apple Computer, which everybody says
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.700]   is going to do a Pandora, right?
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.220]   Yes.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.300]   I think I believe that.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.060]   I believe that.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.020]   And they have the deals.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.260]   They're the ones that can do it.
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:56.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.620]   They have to do it.
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.660]   Do they?
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.020]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.700]   I think-- well, I just think it makes a huge amount of sense.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.900]   Like you said, they have the deals.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:04.780]   They have the arrangements.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.980]   They have the audience.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.500]   It's clearly what people want.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.580]   If you look at Pandora and Spotify and others,
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.180]   they would be crazy not to do it.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.860]   And it's what the music industry wants.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.140]   If there's one company in the music industry,
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.660]   it does not like it's Pandora.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.980]   Really?
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:21.660]   I mean, they--
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.620]   Tim Westerkin says, hey, we pay-- what is it?
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:29.100]   60% of our profits to the artists,
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.140]   they're pumping money into the system.
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.420]   Right.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.940]   But they don't have any deals with the music companies.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.780]   They go through the sort of legal radio royalties.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:41.740]   So it's not like Spotify or the other MOG or Rhapsody.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.080]   Right.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:49.240]   Spotify in particular, which paid out a huge upfront money
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.360]   to the record labels in order to launch and use.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   And Spotify gives money to the record labels
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:55.840]   as licensed fees.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.520]   They have cut deals with each label.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.800]   Well, Apple would obviously do whatever the record industry
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.520]   wants.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.520]   So you think what you're saying is the record industry
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.360]   wants to kill Pandora with an Apple product.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   Or some competing product.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.560]   No industry wants anyone to have a monopoly.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.320]   So Spotify has a radio program, an audio MOG.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:17.840]   They all do so.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.480]   Why is Apple resisted this up to now?
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.200]   Because Apple really could have done this years ago.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.800]   And they've never said-- they've always said, well,
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.680]   we don't believe in a subscription model.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.000]   Well, there's two different things here.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.560]   There's radio, which is Pandora.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.280]   And then there's a Spotify style, $10 a month.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.440]   All you can eat, subscription.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.760]   And they've done neither.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.280]   Right.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.640]   The one that we've reported that they're working on
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.480]   is the radio for sure.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.440]   They're not going to do this.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.920]   They're in late stage deals for the radio.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.800]   The subscription service-- I mean, they're sort of a half
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.680]   step there with iTunes match.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.000]   And you pay $25 a year.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.720]   You get to stream your music.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.880]   But it's only your minis.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.960]   Not like Spotify, where it's all 16 million songs
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.000]   or whatever the--
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:55.480]   Right.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.640]   They haven't really indicated that they're
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.200]   looking to get into the sort of--
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   all you can eat, subscription.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.400]   Why would they want to get into radio?
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.680]   Because they see that Pandora is taking over.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.400]   I mean, Pandora--
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.680]   Bigger than Spotify?
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.560]   Way bigger.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.960]   Pandora's way bigger.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:11.400]   Well, that's it.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.720]   Yeah, I use them a lot more.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:12.720]   Maybe not.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.200]   But I thought that was just me.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.680]   No, it's most people.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.040]   Is that because it's easier, you just turn on a station
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.360]   and then let it play it for you?
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.240]   It's more like real radio.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.560]   As opposed to Spotify, we have to put a playlist together
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.320]   and play it that way.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.240]   Well, they have radio now.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.440]   I mean, most people--
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.600]   People like radio.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:32.120]   Radio itself, old time radio, was a much bigger market
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.320]   than purchasing vinyl or CDs.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.160]   People just like to turn on.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.920]   And especially if they can say, punch in one time,
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.520]   here's the artist that I like and then just play
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.640]   a bunch of different stuff for me.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.480]   I want to hear something new.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.560]   Pandora is US only.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.600]   So when you say it's bigger than Spotify, you mean in the US?
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.920]   They operate in at least one other country now.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.960]   I'm not sure which.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.880]   But yeah, they have a smaller global footprint.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.560]   And they are in cars, somebody in the chat
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.240]   and pointed out.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.680]   So that's an advantage.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.520]   And on all mobile phones, pretty much,
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.600]   you don't need to subscribe in order
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.440]   to listen to Pandora on your iPhone.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.280]   Matthew, do you use Pandora in Canada?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.560]   Are you--
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.280]   They don't have--
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.560]   They don't operate in Canada.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.160]   OK.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.320]   So do you use a radio service or what do you do for music?
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.360]   No, no, I don't.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.280]   Just-- yeah, I just have iTunes.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.720]   You own music.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.080]   I do.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.720]   It feels more and more old fashioned to buy a song for 99 cents.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.960]   I think it is.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.080]   I wonder if Apple didn't just wanted to wait
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.000]   and see whether streaming was something
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.800]   that enough people wanted to do.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.040]   I must admit, I was skeptical about it
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.960]   that that many people would want to.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.960]   I thought, the sort of ownership that people would want to have.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.800]   These are my songs, and they live here, as opposed to just--
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.880]   I get to access them.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.200]   And I know Fred Wilson has argued for a long time
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:02.080]   that streaming would become the way people want to experience
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.720]   music, and he seems to be right.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.360]   It does have the piracy problem, too,
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.120]   and another reason the music industry prefers it.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.200]   They don't have to worry about you stealing music
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.800]   or giving it away or anything like that.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.160]   And everybody pays money.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.480]   It's an annuity.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.120]   We're going to get 10 bucks from everybody a month.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.960]   But being conservative, basically,
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.760]   has worked for Apple really well.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.880]   If streaming was so obviously superior as a business,
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.400]   Rhapsody would be doing more fabulously than it is
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.800]   and have way more users.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.480]   And Apple would not be dominating.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   Apple has managed to dominate the music business
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.320]   by selling downloads up until now.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.200]   I do agree that it's not a given.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.160]   I will be able to do that forever.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:45.960]   Well, now that ACDC is on iTunes, I think there's--
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.840]   so this is interesting.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.440]   You know, it's funny, because when I heard this on the boat,
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.400]   I like ACDC.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.200]   And they did the same thing they did with Led Zeppelin,
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.800]   where it's 99 bucks for all their studio recordings.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.080]   I don't know how many songs that is.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.520]   And then if you want all their studio and they're live,
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.760]   it's $149.99.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.360]   And I clicked Buy.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.360]   And then I went, no, wait a minute.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.360]   Why would I buy that?
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.720]   Because I'll just listen on Spotify or Pandora.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.920]   I actually have an ACDC.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.360]   That's actually an interesting point.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.800]   There's been an ACDC channel.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.560]   I've been listening to ACDC and The Beatles on Pandora
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.840]   for a long time, even though you couldn't buy their music
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.160]   until recently.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.080]   So there's an interesting point.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:29.720]   So forget it.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.920]   MySpace is trying to cash in 50 million bucks
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.240]   before anybody notices.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.760]   They're probably trying to go to the unsophisticated investors
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   before anybody notices that the real player is not Pandora.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.840]   The real player is going to be Apple.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:45.320]   You think when Apple marches in, it's over for Pandora?
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.520]   Well, if their business goes away,
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.560]   if they're targeting the Spotify market, then, you know,
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.600]   that's something that I don't think Apple is getting
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.800]   into immediately.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.440]   So what about somebody in the chatroom, Chuck E. J. says
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.280]   "Turn Table FM."
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.080]   What about the turntables and the groovesharks
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.680]   of the world where you--
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.840]   Yeah, what about turntable?
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   Where are they?
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.840]   How are they going to survive?
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.440]   I mean, aren't they quasi-illegal anyway?
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.680]   I mean, how are they getting around that?
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.040]   Well, they cut some deals with The Labels
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.520]   several months after they launched,
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.520]   but they eventually did.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.160]   But usage there has fallen off big time.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.640]   I remember everybody at one point was talking about turntable.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.880]   Everybody was in a room.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.560]   And I haven't heard about it in months.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.080]   Isn't that funny?
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.480]   It's because everything ended up being dubstep.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.960]   You could start in a country and Western station,
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.520]   and it would be dubstep within 10 songs.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.240]   But it's also like, you know, draw something or--
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.600]   I mean, you remember what that was doing that.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.640]   OMG Pop, what a deal that was.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.520]   So Pandora has been doing a trial service in Australia
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.800]   and New Zealand.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.480]   So you could have gotten off the boat
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.400]   and loaded up some Pandora.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.480]   I could have.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.720]   Now, they have supposedly secret sauce, the music genome
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.240]   project.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.240]   That's actually how it started.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.880]   Tim Westigren said, we're going to get a bunch of musicians,
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.400]   listen to a bunch of music, and classify it
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.120]   based on a bunch of features.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:20.440]   Singer, songwriters, acoustic with banjo is a category.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.120]   And then if you like that, we could--
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.000]   so that's right theoretically.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.280]   That gives them an advantage.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.880]   But in your experience, is Pandora better?
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.560]   Because of that, I don't think so.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.200]   I like slacker better for--
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.840]   Is it also the same idea?
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.560]   Same basic idea, but it seems to be more tweakable.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.000]   Right.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.160]   I can put my own knowledge of what I like into the stations.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.040]   Pandora also will veer off track sometimes.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.080]   Like you'll be listening, then just weird stuff will show up.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.800]   Or repeats.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.640]   You hear the same song again and again and again.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.480]   Yeah, the genome concept only works
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.120]   if you have thousands of people listening to every new song.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:57.320]   Right.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:57.840]   Forever.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.760]   I mean, it started over a decade ago, I think--
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.880]   But how up to date is it?
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.320]   --with just the intention of classifying.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.360]   But still, the catalog can be limited when--
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.520]   the alternative, like Apple Genius,
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.320]   or I think Google does this, is to just crowdsource
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.000]   based on what everyone is listening to to understand
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.440]   relationships, rather than having a few musicians
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.440]   classify the songs.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.080]   Forgive me, I'm still on Australian time.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.120]   It's like 4 in the morning.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:25.640]   No, it's not.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.960]   It's noon or something.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.040]   We're going to take a break.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:30.480]   Come back with more.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.280]   Mark Billions here from Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   Harry McCracken, time.com.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.160]   What have you been writing about lately, Harry?
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.080]   I love this idea that you're using Windows.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.200]   Was this a challenge, the Windows Phone Challenge thing?
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.160]   Or are you just a side of the--
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.600]   I just wanted to live with it for a while.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.320]   And it is-- the phones are nice hardware.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.240]   And the polish of the operating system is extremely high.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.440]   It's probably the closest thing there
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.640]   is to Apple polish.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.600]   But you kind of feel like you belong to a very small club,
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.120]   which has both pros and cons.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.280]   That is the real challenge, though, isn't it?
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.440]   That you can have a really good system.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.200]   And you could even have a good app ecosystem.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.320]   We'll debate whether they do.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.360]   But you could even have a good app ecosystem.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.480]   And still, people have invested in Android or iPhone.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   They're just not looking.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.120]   Is it too late for Microsoft?
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.120]   That's a big question.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.880]   And I think a lot of people buy either the phone, the person
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.760]   in the store recommends to them.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.360]   Or they buy the phone that their friends and family are using.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.720]   And both iPhone and Android are over that hump.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.760]   Everybody knows people who are using them.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.960]   And they're kind of an easy sell if you're a salesperson.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.520]   Windows Phone is not over either of those humps yet.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.080]   Microsoft did make an effort to overcome that first condition
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.680]   by-- they didn't used to offer spiffs to the employees who
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.040]   sold Windows phones.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.040]   They're trying to get in good with the stores.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.080]   So I think it's like $50 or something.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.840]   They're making it strong after they get salespeople
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.320]   at least recommended.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.920]   And maybe they've improved that situation.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.440]   But how many people are moving from a--
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.000]   maybe there's still a lot of feature phone users.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.600]   People who have never bought a smartphone.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.160]   I mean, that's who's going to buy it, right?
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.680]   I mean, depending on whose numbers you believe, something
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.440]   like roughly half or a little longer half.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:06.960]   All right.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.200]   People may not have a smartphone at all.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.240]   So that's a big market.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.040]   It's a huge market.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.480]   If they can capture that.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.640]   Well, interesting.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.120]   Time.com is where you can see here.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:24.440]   Harry's latest talk-- we'll talk about the Wii U.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.400]   Play hard is the headline.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.400]   We'll see what that means.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.280]   That could be-- that's ambiguous.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:30.800]   That could be good.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.960]   That could be bad.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.880]   We will read more in just a bit.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.160]   Talk more in just a bit.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.200]   Also Matthew Ingram from Giga Omar.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.080]   Our show today brought to you by the new Squarespace.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.840]   I know we have a lot of photographers, artists, people who--
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.520]   even if you don't do it professionally,
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.880]   would like to have a website that shows off your work,
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.800]   your art in a beautiful way.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.760]   But that's easy to maintain and not expensive.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.960]   And Squarespace is so good for photographers, filmmakers,
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.440]   writers, painters, animators.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.880]   Anybody who's creating and wants to make
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.320]   a beautiful public presence for themselves.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.160]   You can try it right now for a couple of weeks.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.240]   Free 14-day trial.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.960]   You get full 24/7 support.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.880]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.800]   Just go to squarespace.com and click the Get Started button.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.440]   And you'll see immediately some new things.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.160]   This is the new Squarespace 6, which just came out.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.400]   It uses something called Responsive Design, which
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.920]   is kind of the latest buzzword in web design.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.240]   But the idea is I was so frustrated.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.600]   When you're on the boat, of course--
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.320]   and I'm using a mobile device to look at all the web pages--
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:35.440]   you see how many companies still have mobile sites
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.760]   distinct from their desktop site.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.480]   And they're often terrible.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.960]   And they don't keep updated.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.720]   The new thing in web design is what's
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.280]   called mobile responsive design.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.720]   So you make one site period.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:47.880]   There's no mobile site.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.920]   And it just responds to the platform.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.840]   And this is what the new Squarespace does.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.320]   So when you put a picture up there,
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.600]   they make seven thumbnails, one for every possible site--
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.680]   everything from an iPhone to a 27-inch desktop.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.040]   It's very easy to do your own design
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.320]   with just basically dragging and click.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.800]   Although if you are a JavaScript CSS HTML5
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.160]   whiz, you absolutely can get into the guts of this.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.000]   But when you create this design, whether you
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.880]   just state of the art code generation,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.280]   or you do it by dragging and dropping,
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.040]   it's going to look good at any size.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.200]   It makes it very easy to blog, to post.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.320]   They have tools to integrate into your Flickr,
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.080]   your Twitter, your LinkedIn, your Facebook.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.600]   They even have Google Maps integration,
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.560]   which I think is so cool.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.800]   So I want you to give it a try.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.120]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.360]   Click the Try It free button.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.720]   And you've got two weeks for free.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.200]   If you decide to buy, that's when we come in.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.920]   And don't worry about it unless you decide to buy.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.600]   But if you decide to buy-- first, let me show you the pricing,
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.440]   because this is new.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.400]   They've really simplified this.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.200]   There's just two plans.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.480]   There's the standard and the unlimited.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.200]   The standard plan-- this is as low as you can go if you buy.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.720]   A year's worth is $8 a month.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.440]   That's very low.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.720]   That, by the way, this is hosting and the software.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.880]   You're not just getting the software.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.920]   This is the hosting.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.200]   And if you buy an annual plan, they'll even
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.880]   register your domain name for free
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.560]   and hitch it up to your Squarespace site.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.320]   The standard plan is great for a simple site.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.320]   Maybe it's a wedding or a one-shot deal.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.560]   But let me tell you, if you're planning a bigger site,
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.920]   a blog or a portfolio, look at the unlimited plan.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   It's still very affordable.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.560]   $16 a month, that's for hosting and all the software
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.280]   when you buy an annual plan.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.680]   You get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.880]   So if you're a wedding photographer,
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.280]   you have a different gallery for each shoot, for instance,
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.840]   unlimited bandwidth, no limits in the amount of traffic served
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.960]   to your site visitors.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.840]   And by the way, no matter how many people come to that site,
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.120]   it will be up and responsive.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:48.560]   They have a very clever infrastructure setup.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.600]   This is what I like.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.080]   Not only unlimited bandwidth, but unlimited storage
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.440]   and unlimited contributors.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.600]   So you can have multiple people.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.360]   If this would be great, you want to do a newspaper?
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.640]   Done, $16 a month, that's all.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.120]   And of course, the annual plan gives you the custom domain
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.640]   and all that stuff.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.320]   It integrates with Google Apps and MailChimp as well.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.240]   Published to Facebook pages 24/7 support
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.000]   and a whole lot more.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.320]   I want you to try it.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.720]   Go to squarespace.com, click the try it button,
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.680]   get started.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.600]   If after two weeks you think, this is good.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.160]   You can import all your existing stuff,
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.400]   all that images and links and even comments are preserved.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.720]   This is good, then go to the pricing page, but do use our offer.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.560]   Twit 11, because you're going to get 10% off that price.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.120]   That's why the annual plan makes a lot of sense.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.440]   You get the most savings.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.760]   Twit 11.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:33.760]   Or can you do two years?
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.760]   Nerve says it's even cheaper if you get two years.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.920]   I don't even see that.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.840]   Yeah, do two years.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.200]   What the hell?
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.400]   The more you buy, the less you'll pay.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.720]   And you get the 10% off no matter what.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.240]   If you use the offer code twit11, the 11 means, of course,
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.520]   the month of November.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.600]   We change that offer every month.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:57.240]   So if you're listening to this in December, use Twit 12.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.480]   So the Wii U, did I miss something?
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.600]   This was the big-- this was the big watch
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.920]   while I was on the boat.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:07.120]   Nintendo, we've been waiting for an exciting new addition
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.480]   to the Wii family.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:12.080]   It's the first next generation game console from anybody.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:12.920]   Right.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.560]   Years.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.840]   Microsoft supposedly is doing an Xbox, I don't know,
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.760]   720 next year.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.640]   They'll announce that at E3.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:24.200]   I don't know what Sony's planning with the PlayStation 3.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.280]   But Nintendo's been a little behind, because it's not HD.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.680]   The Wii is not HD.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.760]   It's basically the Wii is basically games
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.600]   and almost nothing but games.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.920]   Yeah, no media integration.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:39.200]   It had Netflix and Hulu, but not too much.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.840]   And the Wii U, I mean, it's Nintendo,
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.760]   so it's clever and inventive.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.480]   You have this game controller that's essentially a tablet
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.480]   that interacts with your TV in different ways.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.960]   So you can like fling stuff up the TV,
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.920]   or you can hold the game controller up and look around you.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:58.040]   I look at the Wii U ads, though, and I think this doesn't--
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.440]   this doesn't look like-- I don't want to use a stylus
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.560]   on a tablet while I'm playing a game on the big screen.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.240]   I don't even understand that.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.240]   It's a somewhat hard concept to get across.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.520]   And the time I've had with the Wii U, it is fun to use.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.800]   OK, you'd like it.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.640]   It's a little hard to show that in a commercial.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.920]   And I mean, the big challenge is,
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.760]   when the Wii came out in 2006, there was no iPhone.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.400]   There was no iPad.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.800]   Facebook didn't do games.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.920]   There was no Angry Birds.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.240]   If you were kind of a casual gamer
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.600]   and you wanted to do casual games,
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.000]   you bought yourself a Nintendo console.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.720]   And there's just so much other choice out there.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.480]   And you don't have to spend $300 in a console and $40 to $60
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.440]   on games anymore.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:37.920]   Right.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.960]   You probably have a device in your pocket
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.880]   and can play the games for free.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.480]   That feels like the biggest risk to me
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.280]   is that the type of games that Nintendo has always
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.320]   focused on are sort of family-friendly,
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.440]   easy to get into cartoon-like characters.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.840]   So that sounds exactly like a social gamer, a Facebook game.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.040]   Whereas the other consoles, a lot of the games
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.000]   are really hardcore first-person shooters or strategy
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:05.840]   or whatever.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.800]   Seems like Nintendo's at the biggest risk
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.080]   from social gaming or web gaming.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.240]   Yeah, I mean, a hardcore player will still happily pay $300
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.520]   for a console.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.960]   And the Wii U does reach out to those folks a little bit.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.440]   They have Call of Duty.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.520]   They have some other stuff.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.120]   It's a little more up that alley.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.600]   But Chad, do you have that graphic?
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.560]   Because so people play Call of Duty online.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.840]   And the new Call of Duty is out and very exciting.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.960]   Probably the hottest game right at the last of this month,
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.280]   so far anyway.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.320]   Very exciting.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.600]   Lots of people playing it on Xbox, PlayStation 3.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.280]   How many people are playing it on Wii U, multiplayer?
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.840]   768.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.720]   Worldwide!
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.960]   Where is that from?
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.080]   Is that from Reddit?
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.360]   Yeah, this is from Reddit.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.200]   And this was posted a day ago.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.280]   That's depressing.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.320]   I mean, Nintendo was never really
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.840]   about these types of games.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.800]   And every time they come out with a new console,
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.280]   they say, we're reaching our hands across the aisle
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.480]   to get as many third party developers building for this.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.640]   And this is going to be the system where people actually go out
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   and buy Call of Duty and Madden.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.720]   And it never happens.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.480]   They've been saying it since the GameCube.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.080]   And they were saying it with the Wii U.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.480]   They still have a pretty strong base of people
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.880]   who will go out and drop $300 to play the franchises
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.960]   they love, like Mario or Zelda.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.520]   That's where they're going to always do.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.080]   Fine.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:28.520]   Right.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.800]   But the business model is a little flipped with this console,
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.880]   which, if I were an investor in Nintendo,
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.080]   would concern me a lot.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.640]   Because they've always made a profit from their systems.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.040]   And this is the first console.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.840]   As far as I know, maybe the 3DS, after they drop the price on it,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.880]   when nobody bought it, after launch,
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.000]   may have been losing money.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.480]   But this console from the start is losing money.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.160]   So they're banking on services and games.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.600]   Here's the ad.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600]   I watched this.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.920]   Well, first of all, they're playing off the fact
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.520]   that it's the whole family, right?
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.160]   He was playing this.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.080]   So here's Junior with his Wii U using his stylus.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.600]   And then Mom's doing karaoke.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.760]   And I don't know why there's all those strangers in her home.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.800]   But I don't know what he says.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.600]   Is he shopping?
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.200]   What does he do?
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.200]   Oh, he's playing Mario Kart.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.000]   The other thing that is potentially a big deal is we TV.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.240]   So there is a TV.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.240]   There's a media component.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.800]   Well, there will be, except a lot of that.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.400]   They're showing that off.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400]   They're not shipped with the console.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.680]   They have some really interesting stuff
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.000]   using this controller.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.080]   But look at that thing.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.040]   It's quirky.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.240]   It does not match up with modern day tablets.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:32.800]   It doesn't.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.960]   It looks like Fisher Price designed it.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.280]   A little bit, although I have to say that it's lightweight.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.200]   It is light.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.080]   Because it's hollow.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.640]   And the latency, at least when I've used it,
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.680]   has been very well done.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.640]   Oh, so that's interesting.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.640]   Yeah, so is it Bluetooth?
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.840]   How is it connecting to the Wii?
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.360]   I'm not sure.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.000]   But when I've used it, Nintendo has set it up.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.240]   So it's not a living room test.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.360]   Yeah, I used it at CES.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.520]   But it's very real time in a way that was pretty impressive.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.000]   I was just using it over the weekend
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.520]   that my buddy's place to play the new Mario game.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.440]   And as you described, there's almost no latency.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.040]   It feels-- I mean, for a family with one big screen TV
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.920]   in the living room, and dad wants to come in and watch
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.000]   football, the kids want to keep playing Mario,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.080]   that's a pretty smart solution to that problem.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:19.880]   What how?
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.240]   Because the kids play it on the--
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.840]   Because you can keep playing on the tablet wall--
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.840]   Oh, yeah, the kids go like that.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.720]   Some new switches TV.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.560]   Play on the tablet, kid.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.320]   This is what they do with iPads now.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:30.680]   Right.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.840]   Just play on the tablet wall.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.340]   Right.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.600]   Something else comes up on TV.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.000]   And it's pretty clear that within the lifetime of the Wii U,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.400]   there will be many games that use a tablet and the TV.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.120]   There already are-- if you have an Apple TV,
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.360]   there already are some games that do something at least
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.600]   vaguely similar with your iPad interacting with the TV.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.200]   Yeah, that's the second screen thing, right?
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.600]   I have to say, to go back to my internal demographic
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.080]   research with daughters and their friends,
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:59.880]   no one is interested in the Wii U even remotely.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.280]   So they're 13, 14.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.960]   All they want is an Xbox or a PlayStation 3.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.120]   And the main reason they want it is because they want to play
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.960]   online with their friends or people around the world.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.240]   I don't think they care about playing with people
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.560]   in the same room as them.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.040]   Do they want the last Wii?
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.400]   Because that did extremely well for an event.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.960]   They did, yeah.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.640]   My little friend, a nine-year-old Michael, has a Wii,
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.800]   has a PlayStation 3.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.560]   I don't even think he's ever heard of the Wii U.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.240]   He wants an Xbox.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   Because he plays Call of Duty.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.760]   He wants Xbox 360.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.000]   It's MiraCast.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.840]   It's a peer-to-peer.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.720]   This is how it talks to--
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.920]   it's a Y4 of Wi-Fi.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.000]   But a peer-to-peer wireless screencast
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.880]   standard created by the Wi-Fi Alliance.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.280]   It's an open alternative to airplane mirroring.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.760]   That's what-- according to the chat room,
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.680]   that's what Nintendo is using.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.960]   People keep assuming that eventually Nintendo
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.560]   will do what Sega did.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.560]   And either downplay or get out of hardware
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.760]   and put Mario and Zelda on everybody else's platforms.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.720]   How is that working out for Sega, right now?
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.240]   It's never been the same.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.520]   Whatever happened to Sega?
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.640]   They're still pumping out Sonic's equals.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.200]   Yeah, I bought Sonic on the--
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.880]   it was the-- go to Starbucks.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.720]   It's the free game at Starbucks this week on the iPad.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.640]   Is it good?
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.840]   Yeah, I love Sonic.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.720]   But it's nostalgia.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.000]   It's the same reason you play Zelda or you play Mario.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.440]   It's nostalgia.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.920]   I love I miss my Sega.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.040]   Sega!
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.360]   And-- Sega!
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.200]   Sega!
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.200]   And-- God.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.160]   I just missed that.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.040]   And so in fact, the Dreamcast was--
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.040]   I think-- well, I shouldn't say this,
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.440]   because I'll sound stupid, but the best gaming system ever
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.080]   made.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.080]   Dreamcast was great.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.600]   It was great.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:38.600]   It was great.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.600]   It was a pioneer in--
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.240]   It was a ran Windows CE.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.960]   It was no 3DO.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.200]   3DO, I had one of those too.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.880]   Loved that.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.120]   You ever had Atari Lynx?
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.480]   There were a lot of good game systems
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.600]   until it was just eaten alive by PlayStation 3 in Xbox.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.000]   And that was it.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.280]   It was all over.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.560]   And I remember getting the first Xbox,
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.480]   and that was all over.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.440]   It was that really was amazing.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.920]   One last word--
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.520]   By the way, the Dreamcast did have a screen in the controller
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.560]   as Mike's point out in our general room.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.200]   Innovative.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.040]   The VMU.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.880]   See?
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.400]   I think people do have this long history
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.760]   of underestimating Nintendo.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.200]   I mean, before the Wii came out, people
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.480]   said the Wii was going to be the number 3 console
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.480]   that Nintendo should get out of hardware.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.280]   So while I think it is pretty daunting for them,
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.440]   despite that, I would keep that in mind.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.240]   People always think Nintendo's going to crash.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.280]   I think it's a niche player.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.160]   That's what they said about the Wii too.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.960]   But it was a niche.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.560]   It was the most successful in that shit out.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.560]   It sold well.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.960]   It out-way outsold the other guys for a while.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.480]   But I think some of that is like the Commodore 64
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.040]   that a lot of people bought it.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.920]   And it ended up in a lot of closets.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.000]   Don't you think?
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.680]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.600]   People got excited about the--
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.520]   Mom got excited about the Wii Fit.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.800]   Wii Fit, yeah.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.840]   And everybody thought, oh, this is cool.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.760]   And you can play tennis.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.560]   And you do it.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.360]   You do it for the first-- for a couple of days,
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:02.960]   it's really fun.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.600]   You play it.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.560]   And then that's it.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.040]   It's over.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.920]   And I got to say, you look at that stuff now,
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.680]   like the controller with the baseball bat and the hockey stick.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.880]   And it looks like it's from 20 years ago.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.360]   It really looks dated.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.400]   And that's what they're still doing with this new system.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.080]   I mean, it's the same controllers,
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.400]   all the same concepts for how you play.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.440]   They've just added a tablet on.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.520]   It's going to be a tough sell.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.000]   Total as innovative as--
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.680]   Wii games sold as of September 30,
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.040]   according to-- well, I don't know who the source is.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.720]   It's on Wikipedia.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.200]   Not so bad.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.960]   500 million games.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.680]   Half a billion games.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.440]   That's NES.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.120]   OK, that's good.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.520]   That's a benchmark.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.240]   The Nintendo NES system, half a billion.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.640]   The Wii-- total Wii games, 842 million.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.240]   Well, that's not bad.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.680]   That's not a niche product, isn't it?
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.440]   And through 2010, that was the best selling machine.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.880]   Sega Dreamcast Total Games.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.800]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.360]   Sonic Adventure sold 2 and 1/2 million.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:10.840]   This is fun.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.760]   I don't know where this came from.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.400]   Total PlayStation games sold as of March 31,
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.040]   only 595 million.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.680]   So Wii sold more games.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.840]   I wonder where's Xbox?
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.760]   Let me see if I can find the Xbox.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.800]   Another fun pick from Reddit was this--
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.600]   I was browsing an antique store.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.080]   Wouldn't suddenly--
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.480]   PlayStation Dual Shock is a blessing.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.480]   Wow.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.200]   OK.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.000]   That's an antique.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.800]   Look at that, Mard.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.000]   I understand the rolling pin.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.240]   What does a Dual Shock do?
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.240]   In a gas lamp.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.920]   In a gas lamp?
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.720]   Total Xbox 360 games sold as of March 618 million.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.320]   So based on this, we wins in terms of games--
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.360]   Well, they won.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.360]   One.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:09:59.840]   They did well.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.640]   I think it won.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.160]   Past it.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.360]   I think it won 2010.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.160]   There's no question.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.160]   2010.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.240]   It did in 2010.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.240]   Number one Wii game--
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.240]   Wii Sports, obviously.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.200]   Mario Kart, Wii Sports Resort.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.880]   Didn't those come with the Wii?
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.880]   I thought it did.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.320]   The original Wii Sports came with the Wii.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.960]   The other is Wii Play, new Super Mario brothers.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:29.400]   We fit 22 million Wii Fits, 20 million Wii Fit Plus's.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.840]   A lot of moms doing yoga on a banking sport.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.920]   How many people are playing those like right now?
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.560]   That's the one.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.200]   Yeah, that's the question.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.160]   People get mad at me, though.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.600]   Every once in a while, people get mad at me.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.600]   I don't know.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.600]   Maybe this hasn't happened lately.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600]   But I used to say that.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600]   Oh, come on.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.600]   Nobody-- and people say, no, I love my Wii.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.720]   Sounds like you're 12 when you say that.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.240]   Stop it.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.280]   Apple shares are back.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.080]   Are they?
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.240]   Shares of Apple went way down while I was gone.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.680]   What happened?
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.320]   I don't have any Apple stock, so it's not like it hurt me.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.440]   But apparently, they've started to come back as of this week.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.960]   They had a one-day pop that I think
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.480]   was one of the largest increases in market value of a company
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.120]   ever in history in a single day.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.520]   Wow.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.480]   Well, let me look.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.320]   What are they?
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.040]   AAPL, right?
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.080]   So they're at 571.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.080]   They're still under 600.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:34.280]   Let's look at the Google finance record for the last one.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.520]   I don't know.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.840]   Months.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.320]   Yeah, look at that dive.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.240]   And they had a big pop on the seventh.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.440]   It looks like the 18th.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.200]   And then they're kind of hovering.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:52.720]   What did this have to do with anything?
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.840]   Was there a news story associated with this?
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.000]   Let's see.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.440]   Well, I don't think it's been exploding since forest all
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.360]   left.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.760]   I think investors are always concerned.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760]   Right.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.120]   One, that something's changing, that the magic's gone.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.760]   And two, just how much bigger can this company get?
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.280]   I think there's a little bit of concern that they've peaked.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.560]   But there's been that same concern for the past five years.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.160]   Hey, but look at their tax bill, only 1.9%.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.920]   That's a-- I invest in that company.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.560]   But they're running their company well.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:32.640]   This was the story that coincided with the bottom, which
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.480]   was that Samsung was going to be allowed
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.840]   to sell other devices in the US.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.640]   Yeah, I think there was a bunch of skepticism around that
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.920]   and a bunch of skepticism around how much bigger they could get.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.080]   And then all of a sudden, everyone
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.680]   decided that it was overdone and the stock bounced back.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.200]   I didn't see a figure-- I think their last year profit,
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.440]   41 billion, I think it was.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.280]   More than Microsoft, eBay, Google, Yahoo, Facebook,
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.640]   and Amazon combined.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.440]   So it's really more the stock market saying,
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.040]   they're big and how can they get any bigger than anything else?
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.440]   It's like, well, we've already seen all the growth
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.600]   we're going to see, because how can you get any bigger?
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.360]   I like this article, Business Insider.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.560]   I know probably not your favorite source world.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.200]   Well, they run a lot of our content.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.760]   Do they?
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.920]   Do they credit you?
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.360]   Sometimes.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.880]   Jay Yarrow says, I love the title.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.840]   Apple's biggest problem.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.600]   Google is getting better at design
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.880]   faster than Apple is getting better at the internet.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.120]   That's patently obvious, right?
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:41.880]   Is that not true?
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.560]   Well, that headline is actually referring to somebody else's
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.200]   story, who made that same point and more or less
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.280]   the same words.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.200]   And that other post was a good one.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.880]   OK, let me find that other post.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.840]   I shouldn't even give credit to these guys.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.600]   It was Patrick Gibson.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.760]   OK.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.160]   Yes, it was--
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.440]   Who used to work at Apple?
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.440]   Oh, yeah, it was a blog post on his Tumblr.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.640]   Yeah, that post was over at the rate.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.760]   Long time Mac user, diehard Apple fan,
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.520]   even I will admit that Apple's approach to the web has been--
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.040]   oh, I can't say the word-- bad.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.760]   And I agree.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.920]   I've been saying this for a long time.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.560]   Apple cannot figure out web services.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.080]   It is a hardware company and a brilliant design company.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:23.960]   But that's what's scary.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.040]   If Google gets good at design and already knows services,
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.240]   isn't this a problem for Apple?
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.240]   So his argument is--
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.080]   So his point is, you should buy Twitter.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:34.640]   I don't think--
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.280]   Because they understand how to run a broadly distributed
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.280]   web service.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.320]   Is that sarcasm?
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.520]   Yeah, that doesn't sound quite right, does it?
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.680]   I don't know.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.760]   I think he has-- he definitely has a point about them.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.600]   Every web service Apple has ever introduced is painful.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.280]   It's not-- it's the exact opposite of what you expect
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.880]   from Apple's devices.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:00.200]   So it's like a punch in the face, usability-wise.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.640]   So you have this beautiful device,
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   and then you try to use one of their web services,
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.480]   and you just get frustrated.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.760]   They need to solve that problem.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.920]   I think the only thing you could say Twitter solved
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.160]   is scaling.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.120]   They've obviously gotten good at that.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.320]   They can handle-- they have handled 327,000 tweets
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.080]   a minute during the election.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.880]   I mean, they figured out how to solve--
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.480]   we don't see the fail-well anymore.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:27.280]   And that's bitter knowledge one hard one, so that's good.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.160]   That would be valuable.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.920]   But I don't think that's the solution to the problem.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.360]   And help you become good at iCloud.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:36.040]   We could have quite a user interface issue about what kind
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.280]   of services, how to provide them,
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.960]   how to make it understandable.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.840]   Apple just--
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.160]   If you look at-- if you look at his post,
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.640]   part of his point is that they don't have the talent.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.160]   Right.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.120]   They don't have the engineers.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.400]   They don't have the developers who can do this stuff.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.120]   Who does?
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.840]   I mean, if they could get some of those by buying Twitter.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.680]   Well, Google does.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.360]   Facebook does.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.000]   Google does.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:53.640]   Facebook does.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.320]   They've sucked up all the talent.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.560]   They're a vacuum cleaner.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.320]   In a certain sphere--
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:04.560]   I mean, if you're a web person or a social networking person,
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.800]   you're more drawn--
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.000]   there's no reason for you to want to go work at Apple.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.040]   And Apple provides very little incentives
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.880]   for you to want to go work there.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.960]   They have this sort of mentality that everyone
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.000]   should want to work at Apple.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.920]   So why should we pay a premium and bonuses?
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.480]   And so when they're trying to expand and to say internet
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.400]   services, it's kind of hard to attract those developers.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:32.920]   On the flip side, point to that article,
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.880]   Google has developed a sort of complex and a disadvantage
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.960]   recently, which I think Apple has the advantage in that it
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.880]   works very well with Facebook and with Twitter,
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.960]   whereas Google is so bullish on Google Plus
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.080]   that in the realm of internet services,
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:59.880]   Apple being Sweden can be an upside.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.000]   That may be true, but just having not the participant.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:03.500]   Right.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.240]   And one big argument against them buying Twitter
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.360]   is, well, they don't have to.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.800]   They have a partnership with Twitter.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.520]   They have a partnership with Facebook.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.720]   They're both integrated into their devices.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.120]   They don't need to buy them.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.200]   I would just have to disagree that the only thing
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.440]   Twitter knows really is scale.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.480]   I don't think they've solved any other problems,
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.320]   including most importantly, how to make money.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.720]   And also, if you look at the design of their--
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.240]   Design.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.160]   --a lot of users just don't plain don't like their official apps.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:30.660]   Right.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:35.200]   The reason-- the reason they can't get people to use the website
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.720]   is because it sucks.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.480]   And third-party apps are so much better.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.160]   And so Twitter's solution-- kill the third-party apps?
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:41.640]   I don't know.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.880]   I don't think--
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.040]   I would agree with Patrick's thesis
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.120]   that Google's catching up fast, but I
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.800]   would not agree with his solution.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.680]   Although one huge challenge Google has
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.480]   is that Google is getting better and better at usability.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.520]   But then they turn Android over to Samsung, HTC--
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520]   Right.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.160]   --and even Motorola who they own.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:01.660]   Right.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.240]   --then undo some of those--
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.360]   Oh, and it was the worst.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.840]   And the Nexus products are great.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.640]   But so far, none of the Nexus phones or tablets
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.040]   are things that they're selling by the tens of millions.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.720]   Matthew, you've got to get the Nexus 4,
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.520]   because apparently it works with LTE in Canada.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.720]   Yeah, that's what I heard.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.720]   That's a weird hack.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.560]   Get my hands on one.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.000]   It is a weird hack.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.080]   It's a care Canada.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.080]   Or by maple syrup.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:34.280]   But yeah, so apparently it has the capability, not in the US.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.160]   There's an LTE chip-- even though they don't sell the Nexus
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:42.760]   4 as an LTE device, it has an LTE chip, which apparently works
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.640]   in Canada.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.840]   All you have to do is dial star pound, star pound 4, 6,
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.240]   6, 6, star pound, star pound, and shake the phone really
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:51.880]   vigorously.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.200]   And--
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.200]   This is like the KONAMICO.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:55.840]   It is, isn't it?
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.640]   It's like a video game.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:57.400]   Isn't it great?
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.200]   Yeah, I was thinking of the KONAMICO.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:18:59.840]   Exactly.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.720]   Up down, up down, up down, up down, up.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.920]   It's essentially--
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.040]   LJ does the optimus, and this is a slight variant on that.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.920]   So it's left-- it's vestigial chip from the optimus.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.520]   But it's missing some other components, right?
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.600]   I think something to do with the processor,
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.560]   or the amplification of the antenna.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.800]   It can't quite achieve great LTE service,
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.440]   so they didn't build that in.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.840]   Oh, OK.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:29.120]   So my sense of the Nexus 4 is it's not state of the AR.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.720]   There are better, maybe Android phones out there.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:32.760]   It's a developer phone.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.760]   It's a Google experience.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:37.280]   Somebody who is so sold on the plain vanilla Google
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.440]   experience, that's a good choice, or if you're a developer.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   But for most other people, I mean, I'm
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.240]   using the Galaxy Note 2, which I really like.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.040]   It's a good phone, but--
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:45.760]   It's not the best.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.320]   Is it the best?
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.080]   No phone that doesn't do LTE, is there?
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:48.840]   How can you say that?
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.040]   A killer state of the art phone.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.360]   But my point is, I guess, they don't care.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.400]   They're not trying to sell a killer state of the art phone.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.960]   They don't even really want to challenge Samsung or HTC.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.720]   Well, they wanted to put out one phone
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.040]   that could sell everywhere, which is tough to do with LTE.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:04.720]   Right.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.200]   OK.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.760]   LTE is still too fragmented.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.080]   OK.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:12.480]   So this story from techradar.com.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.320]   LG admits reason behind dropping 4G and Nexus 4
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:19.720]   because it's secretly an optimist.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.200]   It's another phone.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.400]   And they told techradar this.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.240]   In order to provide the best possible specification
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.160]   for the Nexus 4, LG utilized the same powerful Qualcomm
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.520]   snaps, Dragon chipset, as in the optimist.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.960]   And that's why there's LTE in there.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.600]   But you have to put other hardware in there, as you pointed out.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.800]   So it's cheaper.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.240]   It's in there, but you don't use it.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.000]   That makes sense.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   We're talking-- if we finish the Wii U conversation,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.840]   is there anything more to say about that?
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:54.200]   Is that going to take off like crazy people
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.120]   going to love that?
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.320]   It's pretty daunting.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.960]   We'll see.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.560]   They do have a bit of a window where they're
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.600]   the only next generation console.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.120]   Right.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.920]   But there will be another Xbox, and there will be another PlayStation.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.080]   When will we see another Windows?
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.840]   I mean, another PlayStation.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.600]   I think Sony has been kind of quiet about it.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.480]   So Nolan Bushnell told me in July, he said, no,
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:17.200]   get console gaming is dead.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.280]   Because-- I'm not sure why.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:25.560]   Because the PCs are powerful enough to handle it.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:30.000]   And if you're a casual gamer, you get a PC.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.200]   And if you're a casual gamer--
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:31.920]   You have an iPad.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.120]   You have an iPad.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.880]   And there's no need for a console anymore.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.720]   Well, you do want something connected to your TV
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.360]   in the living room.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.800]   That was Chad Johnson, our analysts from the Red.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.160]   The gaming analyst.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.240]   Yeah, he's the only guy who plays games.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.240]   I'm sorry, go ahead, Harry.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.120]   I mean, I think you want something connected to your TV
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.960]   in the living room that may or may not be a console.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.920]   For most people, that's not yet a PC.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.720]   It might eventually be an Apple TV.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.080]   But look what happened to online.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.840]   I mean, bankrupt, right?
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.160]   Because nobody wanted it.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.320]   Very few people online at one time.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.600]   It was like 786.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.320]   We you call a duty players.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.920]   So it really--
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.600]   I think you're right, Chad, when you say
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.000]   there was a fork in the road, then there's
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.880]   no room in the middle anymore.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.320]   Now, we do want set-top boxes.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.520]   And I think that's why Microsoft has started to position
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.000]   the Xbox 360 as a media player.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.880]   Sony's done it, but it's not as easy to use.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.200]   It's not as well integrated, in my opinion.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.440]   It's a good Blu-ray player, though.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.400]   That's the funny thing, is it's the greatest Blu-ray player
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.320]   made.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.640]   The Xbox is essentially a living room PC.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.120]   With streaming content.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.160]   It was a Trojan horse, I think.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.280]   Really smart move.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.080]   I agree.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.000]   I thought that actually from day one.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.040]   Because Microsoft had always said, we want to make set-top boxes.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.400]   The problem is they were too expensive,
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.600]   so the cable companies would never do it.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:50.520]   They said, no, we're going to buy these cheapos from Motorola
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.120]   and keep--
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:51.720]   aren't Harris.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.960]   And we're going to keep selling those.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.000]   We're not going to get this expensive stuff.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.280]   It's too powerful.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.840]   So Microsoft said, all right, well, we'll get in another way.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.480]   We'll get a foot in the door through gaming.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.480]   We'll get in the living room once we're in the living room.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.160]   Then we can make it be a media device.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.000]   Good point to Ken from Chicago says,
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.280]   and look at the cost of games on iPhones and iPads
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.440]   compared to a $60 cartridge.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.280]   I'm sorry, cartridge.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.280]   No, I'm not using cartridges.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.920]   What do the kids use now?
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:21.000]   There's those little discs that you put in your PlayStation
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.320]   portable, right?
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.880]   That's what they're all using now.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.320]   Yeah, it depends on the thing.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.080]   Blu-ray for--
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.160]   I know what they use.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.360]   I've got an Xbox.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.000]   I've got it.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.640]   You're freaking me out, I'm just teasing you.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.600]   Why don't you kids use these days?
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.000]   Well, I mean, based on the sales of Halo 4 and the new Call
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.920]   of Duty game, console gaming is alive and well.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.040]   And I think that will still appeal to a lot of people.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.560]   And the way that the Xbox made itself
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.280]   into a Trojan horse and got its way into the living room,
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.800]   as Matthew alluded to earlier, is they
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.560]   went to the kids who wanted gaming in the living room.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.000]   And then they shoveled a bunch of other features
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:03.640]   into there.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.600]   And I think they can continue to use that strategy
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.480]   to a large extent with the next generation.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.360]   And I think the piece that people miss so constantly
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.040]   is it's not just about Call of Duty,
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.800]   and it's not just about the game itself.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.400]   It's about the social interaction that comes with--
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.600]   like I look at nephews and friends of theirs using Xbox Live.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:26.600]   It's all about the other people on that network, some
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.440]   of whom live in foreign countries.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.680]   They have no clue what their names are even.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.720]   And yet they're closer than the kid who lives next door,
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.360]   because they play Call of Duty all the time.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   Well, watching this nine-year-old again, a place
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.520]   called Duty, most of his friends are online.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.040]   They're his age.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.800]   And he's got the headphones, and he's talking to them.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.200]   And they talk about real stuff, like friends do.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:49.760]   They're live.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.240]   While they're--
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:50.760]   While they're--
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.440]   He does the same thing.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.880]   He was talking to one kid, and the kid said, where are you?
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.080]   And they'd been playing for months, I think, on land.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.360]   They didn't even know where he lived.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.800]   So he said Kingston, which is a town in Ontario.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.920]   And the kid says Kingston, Jamaica,
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.880]   because that's the only Kingston you've ever heard of.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.240]   I mean, that's awesome, really.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.200]   And I'm thinking, knows where Canada is.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:12.720]   I--
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.120]   I-- you know, a lot of people say, oh, you see,
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.800]   this is the problem with the generations today.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.440]   They don't have real friends.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.640]   They live in a screen world.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.120]   But I don't think that's necessarily bad.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.040]   I mean, that's just new.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:25.960]   It's different.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.040]   And in some ways, I think it's amazing that people know
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.000]   people now all over the world.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.560]   And you could get to know somebody talking to them
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.280]   on the phone or on the headset, right?
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:34.760]   Yeah, I think--
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.680]   You're a young person.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.640]   What do you think?
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.160]   Well--
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.040]   I think for a lot of people, it's a replacement for telephone
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:42.440]   calls.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.520]   You get on with your closest friends.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.360]   It's still a relationship.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.640]   And you're talking to them over the headset.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.000]   Well--
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.560]   Just so you don't have to meet somebody to be buds with them.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.600]   I don't think so.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.040]   Chera Beer?
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.560]   No.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.400]   By the way, Mark, you're not going to get to be the kid anymore,
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.160]   because you're too old.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.920]   We're going to get a young person now.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.080]   When Mark-- Mark, you were how old when you first
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.200]   started writing for the LA Times?
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.280]   You were just very young.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.720]   Yeah, 19 or 20?
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.400]   And now you're 24, 25?
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:09.920]   25.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.040]   See?
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.320]   It's over.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.560]   Quarter-- quarter century, Mark.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.840]   We need to find a new kid.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:15.800]   How old are you, Chad?
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.400]   23.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.760]   All right, get out of here, Mark.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.320]   No.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.080]   People often say, they say, why don't you
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.720]   have young people represented on Twitter?
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.000]   And I say, because I'm an old fart.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.240]   That's why it's my show.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.440]   Get out of here, you punk.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.040]   Let's see here.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:33.920]   We're going to take a break.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.160]   Come back with more Harry McCracken from time.com
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.720]   and Tech knowledgeizer.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.080]   You splitting your time?
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.840]   If you go to technologyizer.com,
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.320]   you'll land inside time.com.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320]   Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.520]   That's just my stuff.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.240]   You write a lot more.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.400]   Time has taken up all your time, so to speak.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.400]   And I also write for the magazine and do features and whatnot.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.240]   You know, the only thing that bothers me sometimes
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.200]   is that I can't read the whole article,
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.520]   because I'm not a time subscriber.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.520]   That's only for the stuff I write for the magazine, which
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.000]   is maybe about 4% of it.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:03.880]   OK.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.560]   OK.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.720]   It did happen to be true for that Nintendo story.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.240]   But then most of the time you can go and you can see the whole thing.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.960]   Almost everything I do original for online.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:11.720]   That's good.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.920]   OK.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.160]   Uh, and what's going on with Bloomberg Business Week
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.640]   these days, Mr. Mark Millian?
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.800]   You happy there?
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.160]   Yeah, I'm thinking of moving on.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.320]   No, you're going to stick around.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   Good.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:24.920]   Good.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.440]   I got--
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.280]   Great brand.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.720]   I really like it.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.560]   Yeah, me too.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.480]   It's good to hear that.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.320]   Really, regularly.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.360]   Got an article next week's issue about hackathons.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.760]   No longer just the territory of--
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.120]   Facebook was famous for these.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:39.680]   Those rumors?
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.960]   What else are you hacking?
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.240]   So I went to a hackathon--
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.080]   For cheesebroogers.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.000]   --about poop.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.920]   It was a poop hackathon.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.920]   And--
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.200]   I don't know where to go from there.
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.120]   Try to--
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.200]   --with ways to deal with poop.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.000]   To improve sanitation and gone.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.480]   Yeah, that's better.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:58.840]   Yes.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.840]   Said poop.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.040]   I don't want to hack poop.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.560]   Ways to hack removal of it.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.080]   Yes.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:04.680]   Poopathon.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.720]   Do they call it the poopathon?
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:07.600]   That's a good name.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.080]   You should consult with their marketing department.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.520]   Lala po lupa.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.040]   Lala po po po.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.520]   No.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.720]   Yeah, so it's the design firm IDO.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.000]   They work with Apple.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.040]   Oh, I love IDO.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:20.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.080]   Yeah, they're trying to fix the world now.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:24.580]   Yes.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.080]   So they have the nonprofit--
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.080]   --non-profit arm.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.080]   That's great.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.760]   They've done some work on building a toilet service in Ghana
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.520]   and social educational tools, internet tools,
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:39.200]   for people in Ghana using cell phones and Facebook.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.560]   I also went to a lawyer hackathon,
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.240]   where they got a bunch of lawyers together.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.240]   We need that.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.240]   Was this the one that Richard Stalman was at?
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.800]   Because there was a conference Richard Stalman
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.880]   was at to figure out what's wrong with software patents.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.040]   We need stuff like that.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:51.680]   Yeah, it wasn't about--
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.000]   --all the minds together.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]   --about privacy policies.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   Same thing.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.320]   Like, we need to figure-- the world has changed faster than the law
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.640]   can keep up with.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.440]   And we need to figure this out now, fast.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.160]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:05.720]   So the concept of this hackathon was
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.280]   to get experts in the law together--
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.120]   Oh, that's good.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.640]   --to read through privacy policies,
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.520]   come up with better solutions.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:16.560]   But also, there was products that came out of it.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.080]   For example, these stickers that would--
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.560]   little icons that would appear on the top of websites.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:24.560]   So you instantly know whether they're tracking you,
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.280]   how long they're keeping your information.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280]   That's good.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.080]   Sort of like a-- nobody reads through privacy policies,
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.880]   but maybe there were a few icons.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.080]   Just give us a little simple thing that we understood.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.120]   Could be grasped.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.080]   I'm chasing you around everywhere you go.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.600]   By the way, we're going to talk about Patrick Leahy.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.240]   I got my eyes on you, Patrick.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.840]   And apparently, he's got his eyes on us.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.960]   So it's even.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.920]   We'll talk about a bill that is going up
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.200]   in front of the Senate this week that
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.040]   is going to just frost your marbles.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.480]   But that's coming up.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.800]   And also, I wanted to--
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:56.160]   Lotus, I didn't know they went out of-- what happened there?
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.360]   This is from Mary's Technologizer.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:02.440]   Yeah, IBM decided to retire that name after 30 years.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.680]   Wow.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:09.000]   I have to admit, Lotus 123 loved, still hit slash key sometimes
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.600]   when I'm trying to use Excel.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.200]   Lotus Notes?
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.920]   Lotus Notes, not so much.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.200]   And we had to use it as if Davis.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.200]   And it was kind of like a--
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.240]   It was like email, but like broken.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.880]   Yeah, my brother, he just left an accounting firm,
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.360]   but they were still using Lotus Notes as of--
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.520]   You know who uses Lotus Notes?
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.000]   Howard Stern.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:30.840]   Why?
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.600]   It's like, why suffer like that if you don't have to.
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.400]   I see people tend to be fans of the notes,
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.200]   or at least they were for a very long time.
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.080]   But Lotus also did.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.240]   Get ready for this.
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.000]   Remember CC Mail?
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:41.680]   Improv?
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.840]   I have somewhere a box this big for improv.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:45.680]   Jazz?
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.200]   Jazz.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.720]   They did a lot of cool stuff.
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.560]   There was a time--
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:48.560]   Symphony.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.560]   Before Microsoft Office.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.080]   Symphony.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:50.920]   Symphony.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.000]   There was a time when they were synonymous with productivity
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.760]   software and they did some cool products.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.920]   Those were the days, my friend.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.320]   All right, now that you mentioned poop,
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.240]   I've got to go to the bathroom.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.040]   So let's find out.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:03.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.160]   Overshare.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.560]   Team, too much information.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.280]   Let's find out what's coming up on the week ahead, Mr. Tom
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.360]   Merritt.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.760]   Hey, welcome back, Leo.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.440]   You look hand rested and ready.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.360]   It's good to have you back.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:13.680]   Here's a--
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.180]   Thank you.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:15.720]   The things will be keeping an eye on in the week ahead
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.920]   on Tech News today.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.200]   Tuesday, November 27th, couple of conferences.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.240]   Weema NFCUSA.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.360]   That's a near field communication conference in San
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.080]   Francisco.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.840]   Also, Amazon holding their first global customer
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.160]   and partner conference for Amazon Web Services,
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.440]   AWS Re-event.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:35.000]   And Ignition Future of Digital happens in New York.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.760]   Wednesday, November 28th is Cloudbeat in Redwood City,
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:38.640]   California.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:41.640]   And Friday, November 30th, the Nintendo Wii U
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.840]   launches in Europe and Facebook and Windows 8.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.400]   Hackathon kicks off in Palo Alto.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.040]   That's a look at what's coming up in the week ahead.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.280]   Bye, you Leo.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.760]   Previously on Twitter, before you buy--
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.440]   It smells funny.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.600]   I don't like the smell of it.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.520]   It smells like--
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.520]   I'm trying to figure out if it's like perfume and cough
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.160]   syrup fused together or something.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.120]   Is this something you normally do?
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:03.840]   You smell your people?
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.760]   I always smell my products before I use them.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.600]   True story.
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.920]   Frame rate.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:11.640]   Increased, doughy, wimpification of the governor
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:15.240]   and his little romance with Andrea.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.080]   What are you doing?
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.560]   You're the human woman's haters club.
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.560]   You can't have a relationship.
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.440]   You can't find love, Brian.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.120]   It's not the governor.
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.960]   This week in computer hardware, it's
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.720]   like the worst feeling in the world for me.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.440]   It's like, oh, yeah, I'm getting CES meeting requests already.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.360]   And I'm like, oh.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.200]   I got my first like three weeks ago,
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:33.360]   and I just started twitching.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.120]   I'm like, this is way too early.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:39.240]   October is too early for CES 2013.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.200]   Ham Nation.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.560]   This is an old cassette recorder with a George Wright
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.240]   pipe organ tape in it.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:50.040]   And I take some wire clips, plug it into the headphone jack,
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:54.280]   and actually put that audio down the coax line.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.720]   And I put those clip leads to the other end.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:00.480]   And if I hear George Wright pipe organ music,
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.200]   I got the right coax.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.800]   What do you think, George, is that kind of silly or what?
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.520]   Tweet.
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.160]   Tech, just like you like it.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.000]   See that ham nation thing?
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.600]   I think that's when people hear, oh, you're
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.800]   doing a technology network.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.280]   They think that's what the whole thing is all about.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.840]   Well, I'm not a pie boarder to do a banana clip over to the--
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:21.960]   I love that.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:24.520]   How often do you get electrocuted doing that sort of thing?
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.880]   I don't know, because I don't do it.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.400]   I don't play-- you know, I'm a ham.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.520]   And we have this ham here over here.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.040]   And that's the main reason I don't do it,
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.920]   because I'm afraid of getting electrocuted.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:39.360]   It's a dangerous sport being a ham.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.200]   So there are a number of things people can get upset about
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.720]   this week.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:47.280]   Just pass this along to you.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:51.440]   The UN, the International Telecommunications Union,
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.280]   is going to have a meeting.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.640]   And there's-- Google's upset.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.360]   Everybody seems to be upset, because they're
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:07.080]   afraid that the UN is going to take over the internet.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.200]   I don't know if this really is the issue.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.720]   This sounds almost like black helicopters, because when
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:15.560]   you say UN, that's a hot button for some people.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:18.720]   Like, oh, the international lawyers conspiracy
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.160]   or something is going to take over.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.400]   And you know, Google's got their tin foil hats on, too.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.880]   They put out a statement saying, you know, these governments
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.120]   shouldn't be getting together without the companies
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:32.720]   and the stakeholders being present here.
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:34.720]   Well, first of all, I would like to point out
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:38.880]   that the US does not own the internet, right?
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.400]   This is true.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.560]   We invented the TCP/IP protocol with help
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.440]   from the Defense Department.
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.840]   But the World Wide Web, which most of us
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.880]   consider the key thing in the internet,
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:52.840]   was invented by a British guy in Switzerland.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.520]   And the internet is, in fact, a global thing.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.680]   So for a long time, it was, in fact, the Commerce Department
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.600]   that kind of regulated the internet through ICANN.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.280]   Who should regulate the internet?
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.000]   Should there be an international body?
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.760]   The ITU does a lot of this because they're
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.520]   the International Telecommunications Union.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.760]   And it is a UN body.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:17.440]   But I don't think that this is-- in fact, Michael Geist,
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.480]   who I really love.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.080]   He's a Canadian-- do you know Michael?
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:22.640]   Matthew, all you Canadians know each other.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:23.160]   Yeah, I do.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.280]   We're good friends.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:30.000]   So you will, I'm sure, vouch for him,
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.360]   completely trustworthy in this regard.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.240]   Various students.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:38.480]   He says that the UN internet takeover
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.000]   rumors mask a bigger problem.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.760]   You can read about it on his blog,
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.800]   but this actually goes back to June.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:50.360]   But he had a recent post on--
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.800]   I can't remember some newspaper.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.440]   And I-- the Toronto Star.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.400]   That's right, the Toronto Star.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.080]   The Toronto Star.
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:04.840]   So the Globe and Mail is like the big newspaper in Toronto.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.280]   It's a national newspaper.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.400]   And the Toronto Star is just for Toronto.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.680]   OK, got it.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.720]   So the UN internet meeting is not about who pays,
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:15.080]   says Michael Geist.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:15.840]   No, it is about who pays.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:19.120]   It is about who pays, not who rules.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.080]   And this is-- so don't get fooled by this whole notion
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.600]   that the UN wants to run the internet.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.960]   What's really going on is the European internet service
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.360]   providers, through a group called Ettno,
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:33.280]   wants to change the way the internet works.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.400]   So right now, it's a peering model.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.840]   The sending-- they want to replace that.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.680]   So right now, OK, if I--
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.080]   correct me if I'm wrong, because you guys probably
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.520]   understand this better than I do.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.000]   But the idea is that I pay for an on-ramp
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.880]   to this big data pipe, the backbone.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.680]   I pay my internet service provider.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.200]   And they pay some money to get on the backbone and so on.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.160]   Google pays their internet service provider
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.720]   to be available on the internet with servers.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.520]   So we've all paid our internet service providers.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.280]   The data can now flow between us.
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.160]   The problem is-- and I remember AT&T
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.120]   was bitching about how much data Google uses and said,
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:13.440]   Google ought to pay for access to our subscribers.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.720]   It's effectively double-dipping.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.840]   They want me to pay them--
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.640]   my internet service provider for access to the outside world.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.680]   But then they want Google to pay for access to me
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.200]   as their customers.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.560]   This is called the Sending Network Party Pays model.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.760]   And I can see when you have something like Netflix, which
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.040]   uses 40% of all prime time data now in the US.
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.760]   People watching movies like crazy that you might want to say,
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.960]   well, gosh, Netflix should pay to access our customers.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:39.880]   But here's the problem.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.680]   You don't want this as a customer.
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:45.560]   You don't want some providers to have more access to you
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.840]   because they paid Comcast or Verizon for your access.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.200]   And some to have--
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.920]   and I'll tell you who really is worried about this as me.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:55.560]   Because I'm not Netflix or Google.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.720]   Google can afford to pay a little extra to get YouTube
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.560]   to everybody.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.880]   But I can't.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.480]   And I'm on the free and open internet.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.200]   And I want a free and open internet
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.800]   so that you can watch our podcast.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.200]   You can watch our video.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:10.640]   And if Verizon then says, well, are you
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.760]   going to access our customers better, you ought to pay us.
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.000]   So this scares me.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.640]   This idea of sending network party pays.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.360]   That's a scary model.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.320]   Ettno's asking for that.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.240]   It also wants new quality of service rules,
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:27.560]   according to Michael Geist, that are
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:28.840]   with threatening net neutrality.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.320]   The idea is we want to be running-- we
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.760]   want a more reliable network like telecom.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.760]   It would threaten the idea that all internet traffic
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.560]   is created equal.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.000]   So Geist-- and I think he's absolutely wonderful--
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.960]   says, don't you're getting distracted
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.960]   by this idea that UN is going to run the internet?
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:48.640]   That's not the problem.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:52.520]   Watch out for these ISPs who are making a power play
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.600]   and threatening net neutrality.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.120]   I hope that the ITU understands that and doesn't go for it.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:05.440]   You guys are completely silent on this.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.920]   I tried to explain this on the radio show too.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:11.360]   And that's exactly the reaction I got.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.960]   I think Michael makes a great point.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.720]   It's one thing to say that the UN is going to take over
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.200]   the internet.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.240]   Obviously, we don't really want that.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.160]   But I think this danger is more realistic, which
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.520]   is that the ITU and its members are
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.320]   trying to use this as a way of selling their own pockets,
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:32.800]   the telecom companies that are members of this union.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.200]   That's what they really want, is to squeeze more money out
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.840]   of ISPs and users.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.840]   And also, what's wrong with an international body
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:45.840]   regulating the internet?
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.760]   Who should internet?
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.560]   Not the US Commerce Department.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.680]   Well, I can.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.680]   Play is a pretty--
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.880]   But I can is kind of run as--
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:58.200]   I'm not clear on this, but I think the US Commerce
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.840]   Department, unless they've washed their hands of it.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.320]   Yeah, several years ago.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:01.760]   Oh, they did.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.520]   So they're out of it.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:03.080]   Yeah, completely.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:03.600]   OK.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:03.600]   I can't--
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.320]   It's a good point.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.960]   --and international, right?
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.640]   It's not the US.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.760]   I mean, it's based in Marina del Rey, but they--
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.120]   Well, that's the US.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.680]   But they have people all over the world.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:19.440]   They hold conferences in Europe and all over.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.280]   So I guess you don't want the UN running it.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.160]   I'm not sure why.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.720]   You want an international body running it.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.640]   What does running it even mean?
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:31.720]   Well, one of the risks with the ITU proposals
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:33.840]   or one of the things that people are afraid of
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.400]   is that countries like Russia and China and--
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.280]   They don't like a free and open internet.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:41.320]   Right.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.040]   So the risk is that they're going to try and use their votes
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.880]   and sway others to impose sort of restrictions
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:52.200]   on what we think of as the free and open internet.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.200]   Well, that's reasonable to be worried about as well.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.760]   If that-- I mean, that's reasonable as well.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.800]   You basically have a couple of bad actors here.
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.240]   You have internet service providers,
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.480]   and you have governments, both of whom
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:11.000]   want to control and regulate and exploit the internet.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.600]   And what we want is a free and open internet.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.240]   All right.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:15.120]   Anyway, we'll watch that.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.720]   That's this week the ITU meets.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.040]   But unfortunately, they meet kind of in secret.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.080]   So that's another reason to worry.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.760]   Now, this is the one that's really making me crazy.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.480]   So Patrick Leahy, who has kind of a checkered past
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.840]   when it comes to privacy, he's written some good privacy
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:32.240]   bills, and he's also written the IP Protect Act
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:34.840]   and the Patriot Act, part of it.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:38.560]   He has proposed a law scheduled for vote
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.360]   next week in the United States Senate that
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:44.400]   would allow law enforcement agencies
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.720]   and other government agencies, more than 22 government
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:52.640]   agencies, warrantless access to everything you've
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.240]   got on the net, your email if you're an American,
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:58.960]   your Google Docs, your Facebook wall posts,
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.320]   even Twitter direct messages.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:02.800]   Leo?
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.920]   Is that the CNET article you're looking at?
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.840]   Because they did an update for a follow up.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.320]   Oh, good.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.800]   Leahy has basically said that he has no intention
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.600]   of putting that bill forward.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.040]   It wasn't his idea.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.920]   He's not interested in doing those things.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.400]   He's completely repudiated--
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.080]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.200]   --the interest that he might have had in it.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.920]   This is Declan McCullough writing at CNET.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:27.080]   Thank you for updating that.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.360]   Yeah, this was updated at 5 PM.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.000]   It says, so I don't know how he did that five minutes ahead
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.320]   of time, but 4.28 PM.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.300]   Thank you for Matthew for noticing that,
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:41.160]   because this just was updated.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.440]   Seemed like an update that would be more useful
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.640]   at the top of the story.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.440]   Yeah, because the whole story goes on.
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:50.120]   Well, in any event, this is something to watch out for.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.560]   God, this would be-- and by the way,
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.720]   this was not just like the FBI and the CIA.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.880]   This was the Security and Exchange Commission,
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.280]   the Federal Communications Commission, OSHA.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.560]   So he's saying-- lay he's saying, I didn't write this?
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.320]   He's saying he never pushed for that,
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:10.480]   that this was a document that was presented for discussion.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.680]   But it wasn't.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:14.600]   His proposals, and he had no intention of supporting them.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.520]   That sounds convenient.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.520]   That's convenient.
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:19.680]   That sounds like he says, this maybe they
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.640]   floated a little triable.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:23.760]   Hey, would anybody notice if we did this?
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.120]   Oh, they did.
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.440]   I didn't mean it.
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.320]   All right, well, let's keep an eye on that one,
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.920]   because that is exactly what they want, right?
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:35.880]   They want emergency powers, and they're getting closer
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:38.160]   and closer to that.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.160]   Already--
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:39.720]   Go ahead.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.400]   I think some of that fear about that sort of thing
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.080]   came up during the Petraeus thing as well.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.280]   Well, exactly.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.800]   Any number of people say to me, if the head of the CIA
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.840]   can't keep his email secret, then who can?
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.920]   Well, apparently what happened is in this investigation,
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:01.040]   the FBI asked permission from Google, or maybe subpoenaed,
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.200]   or maybe even they had a warrant.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.320]   We don't know.
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.000]   And said to Google, we want to see
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.520]   Petraeus' personal Gmail.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:07.840]   This is not his--
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.920]   now, they have a national security issue.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.440]   And I think that they probably, in this case,
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.200]   because he is the director of the CIA,
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:15.360]   they wanted to see if he had released any secrets in his
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.200]   Gmail, but of course, in the process, the scandal erupted,
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.920]   and he had to quit.
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.520]   But I don't think that that's unreasonable.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.760]   If you're the director of CIA, you
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:26.480]   don't have the same expectation of privacy in all likelihood
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.520]   that I do.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.160]   Nevertheless, it just shows you, with the proper piece of paper,
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:36.120]   people can read anything you put on that.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.680]   Google may--
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.800]   I mean, they may try to fight for your privacy,
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:42.400]   but if it comes down to it, they're
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.120]   going to adhere to the laws in the US, just
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.400]   as they adhere to the laws in China.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.360]   One more thing you might want to get burned about with--
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:52.200]   Guys, please, because I'm ready to get angry.
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.080]   Facebook said they're planning to change their privacy policies.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.480]   But I couldn't figure out what that meant.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.040]   What are they doing?
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.280]   Their terms of usage--
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.280]   A couple of years ago, they had introduced this measure
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:09.520]   where if there was enough feedback to a particular proposed
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.160]   change to their legal documents, their terms of use
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:18.000]   in privacy policies, then they could put it up
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.560]   to a vote with the users.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:23.160]   And if enough users voted, which they never did,
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.040]   but if they did--
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.480]   Because they didn't tell us.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.720]   They left it in-- there was protected by a leopard,
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:30.160]   I think, in the basement.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.920]   They also said they needed 30% of their--
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.920]   Just 300 million people.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.960]   OK, that's going to happen.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.400]   So they did change it or not, or they're going to change it.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.680]   They're planning to change it.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.720]   And is it changing it in a bad way?
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.160]   Well, they're just taking away that sort of voting aspect
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:48.520]   to it.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:54.440]   So they're setting up a help line if you want to send an email.
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:57.160]   You're allowed to be upset about it if you did vote in the past.
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.680]   And if you didn't, you really shouldn't complain.
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:03.440]   Or you just can quit Facebook, guys.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:06.400]   Nobody makes you use Facebook, right?
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.480]   Except your parents' friends' family, high school girlfriend.
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.280]   But other than that, no, but you don't
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.440]   have to use Facebook, right?
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.640]   Vote with your feet.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.400]   That's a vote.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:19.120]   Get out of there.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:28.160]   Here's-- there is an Xbox 720 rumor.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.080]   There's an Apple rumor.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.280]   I don't care about rumors.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:34.320]   The Color app, they got $41 million adventure capital.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.160]   They ended up shutting down.
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:37.880]   And who bought their assets?
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:38.600]   Was it Apple?
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.880]   Apple bought some stuff for a few million.
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.200]   Some folks for like 8 million.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:42.700]   Yeah.
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:46.080]   I'm bored.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.640]   [LAUGHS]
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.720]   I'll tell you what, let's take a break and come back
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:55.520]   with a final word with Mark Millian Bloomberg Business
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:55.720]   Week.
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:57.360]   I had to do it once.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:59.160]   I didn't believe that was the second time.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:46:59.800]   Second twice.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.880]   I had to do it twice.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.040]   Three times, actually, if you're counting.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.120]   Harry McCracken of time.com.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:06.720]   I can't do anything with that.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.480]   Technologizer, I could do something with time.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.440]   Can't do anything with that.
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.160]   It's time.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:11.960]   Crispin simple.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.560]   Crispin simple.
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:19.040]   And from gig ome, the redoubtable, Matthew Ingram.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.720]   I don't even know what that means.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:22.240]   I think it's good.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:22.960]   It is good.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:23.960]   I believe it's good.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.560]   Our show today brought you by audible.com.
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.680]   And I just want to thank Audible because I had a 14-hour
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:33.200]   plane flight to Australia and a 14-hour plane flight back
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:33.800]   from Australia.
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:35.320]   And if it weren't for audiobooks from Audible,
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.920]   I probably would have punched the person next to me.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.520]   Who was a nine-year-old child?
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.800]   So that wouldn't have been very good.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:44.960]   Audible is a great way to pass the time.
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.200]   Now, I always say reading.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:46.720]   You're not reading.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:47.760]   I understand you're listening.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.320]   But you're listening to the greatest books.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.400]   Over 100,000 titles.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:58.000]   I listened to Pete Townsend's autobiography, Who Am I?
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.600]   Who I Am?
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.880]   And then I just started, and I'm really enjoying it.
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:09.040]   No easy day, which is the Seal Team 6 recount of the story
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.560]   of shooting Osama bin Laden.
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.480]   It's really dramatic.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.400]   You got to admire those Seal Team guys.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:14.760]   It's good.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:15.800]   I listened to the gym.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:21.560]   It makes me-- because he talks a lot about PT and as a Seal Team
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:24.360]   member and all the sit-ups they have to do in the runs.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.120]   And so I'm working in the gym, and it makes me feel like, gee,
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:27.840]   this is nothing.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.480]   I should really probably lift a few more pounds on this.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:31.800]   A very good book.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.000]   Lots of good books on here.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.840]   And I'll tell you how you can get a couple for free when
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.920]   you visit audible.com/twit2.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.000]   So if you're not already a member, and I doubt there's
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.840]   anybody listening who's not, because I talk about it all
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:42.520]   the time.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:43.840]   But if you're not already a member,
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.520]   go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.760]   And you can sign up for the platinum plan.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:49.600]   That's two books a month.
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.840]   But your first month is free.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:54.480]   And your first credits are free.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.520]   You can cancel at any time.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.040]   But the books are yours to keep forever.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:03.160]   Two credits come in your way, audible.com/twit2.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.880]   But I don't know what to recommend.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.200]   I would recommend that No Easy Day.
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:06.600]   I'm not sure.
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:09.520]   Unless you're a big who fan, Pete Townsend's book is not.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.040]   It's a little--
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:13.080]   it's one of those things where you have a lot of names
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:15.280]   and a lot of people that you don't really care about.
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:17.800]   But there are some juicy stories in there.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:19.320]   If you've not read The Hobbit yet,
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:21.880]   and you're going to go see the movie, please,
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.160]   don't see the movie until you've read the book.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.280]   You would be doing yourself a big disservice.
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:31.280]   They have a variety of JR Tolkien books on audible.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.480]   Some of them readers.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:36.080]   Some of them acted out.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:36.920]   This is a great one.
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.160]   Robbingless narrates the book as written.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.280]   And you can get this for free.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.240]   The Hobbit.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.640]   Bill Bo Baggins, that is, was the fabulous Bella Donut Took,
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.080]   one of the three remarkable daughters of the old Took,
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.640]   head of the Hobbit, to the exhaust of the movie.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:56.120]   I'm just going to get this because my mom read this to me
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:56.640]   when I was a kid.
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:57.880]   I love this book.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.360]   You must have already read it by now.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.440]   But if you haven't, don't go see the movie.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:04.560]   And get the books spoiled.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.800]   The book is the book.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.960]   Read the book, then see the movie.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:10.640]   I am excited about the movie, though.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:12.080]   A lot of great books on here.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:14.960]   For kids, for adults, fiction and nonfiction,
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.840]   I listened to business books, classics.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.880]   I listened to a lot of history because I love history.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.640]   Audible.com/twit2, pick two books.
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:25.320]   You got two credits coming your way and enjoy them.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.040]   And let me tell you how you can get a third book.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:28.920]   If you go to audible.com/santerson,
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.560]   they still have Legion available for free for anybody.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.120]   If you're already a member, if you don't even want to join,
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.560]   you just want to see what it's like to listen to an audio book.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:40.200]   This is a really good novella by Brandon Sanderson.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.280]   It's at audible.com/santerson.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:45.840]   Legion is fantastic.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:47.840]   I have to say, I love that.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:52.200]   I ate that up before dinner on the plane, actually.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.600]   It was easy.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:56.720]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:59.040]   See these reviewers in sci-fi fantasy too?
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:50:59.560]   That's fun.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:03.680]   You can see who likes which books.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:10.320]   It's really like a fun bookstore with the best audio books.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.280]   You only get one for it.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:14.200]   You have one job, one first.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:18.320]   Here's suggestions for first audio books.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:19.360]   So great.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:20.160]   Oh, man.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.560]   It makes me want to read more.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:22.800]   And that's what's great about Audible.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:23.680]   It makes you want to read more.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:27.800]   Audible.com/twit2, we thank them for their longtime support
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:29.800]   of the Twit Network.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.120]   Let's see.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:31.720]   I'm looking through our list of all these.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:33.520]   See these Chad Johnson works so hard.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.200]   It puts a list together of all the things that happened
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.320]   while I was gone.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:40.640]   Is there any one story that I've left out--
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.480]   I see you scanning through a Mark Millie-- and anything
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:47.280]   that you wanted to talk about before we wrap this thing up.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.320]   We talked about the UN.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:50.800]   Eric Schmidt says parents should talk with kids
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:54.160]   about being online before they talk about sex.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.760]   Did your parents talk to you about being online
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:56.840]   when you were a little big?
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:58.360]   Go get your yard work.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.280]   Oh, I'm getting an ad.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:00.360]   Skip the ad.
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.160]   Thank you.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:04.320]   Thank you Forbes for that fine ad.
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:06.960]   "We need to fight for our privacy or we'll lose it,"
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:09.960]   says Eric Schmidt.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:12.760]   He says, "The justice system wipes a kid's criminal record
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.000]   when he or she turns 18.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.720]   But if a teenager does something incredibly stupid
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.920]   on the internet, it's going to follow you
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:18.680]   for the rest of your life."
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680]   This is a good point.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:23.640]   "So teach kids," I'd argue, says Eric Schmidt, "for those of you
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:26.360]   with teenagers and preteens, probably have the online talk
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.000]   before the sex talk."
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.400]   I think that's probably true because there's
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.840]   anything that they do is going to live forever.
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.200]   And you can't wipe a clean.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.240]   New survey from the Pew Center and the Berkman Center
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.920]   says that actually parents do do that.
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:45.320]   They talk.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.000]   Parenting advice from Eric Schmidt.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:49.960]   Yeah, he's a parent.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.040]   He has kids.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.880]   His daughters.
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.080]   Parents particularly freeteped out
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.160]   that their kids mixing it up with strangers online,
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:59.000]   but reputation management.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.360]   That's a good way to describe it.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:01.760]   And impact on future opportunities
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:03.560]   were also rated high when it came to the worries that keep
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:04.440]   them up at night.
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.440]   And across the board, parents are worried about the information
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:11.760]   advertisers are collecting from their kids.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.200]   Good.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.080]   And they're telling kids what to do.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:15.960]   Those parents who understand the internet.
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:19.520]   Anything else?
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.520]   Did I leave anything else?
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.800]   Richard Stallman on software patents, he said,
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:24.120]   just get rid of him.
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:24.840]   He said, you can do it.
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.760]   RDO has launched VDO.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.440]   Have you tried it?
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.440]   And it's private beta.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:33.880]   It's like, oh, yeah, I haven't seen it yet.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.080]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.560]   It's a video kind of RDO.
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:41.720]   Thanksgiving day retail traffic, 71% up.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:44.880]   I think that's online, right?
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.360]   I don't-- there were not--
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.760]   were there big lines that these Black Friday Walmart used
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.840]   to be-- there'd be crowd out there three in the morning.
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:55.080]   There'd be people killed in the rush to get--
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:55.840]   I was just reading.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:56.600]   There was a guy.
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:57.440]   There was a guy killed.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:58.360]   One guy.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.640]   There was somebody who pulled a gun at a Sears
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.320]   and the other guy hid behind a refrigerator
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:05.440]   to get out of the line of fire.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.480]   You shoot the refrigerator?
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.960]   He didn't actually shoot.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.640]   But those are isolated instances,
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:13.760]   because I think it's not as bad as it was,
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.480]   because I think, as more people are buying online,
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:19.760]   online traffic increased 71% in 2012 versus 2011,
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:23.520]   as the top 500 retail sites received more than 181 million
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.960]   total visits on Thanksgiving day.
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:28.960]   So forget Black Friday, or maybe this is people planning
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.360]   their assault.
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:31.920]   I'm glad-- no, it's Amazon, too.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.360]   I mean, Amazon got a lot more traffic.
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:34.560]   16% increase.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:37.560]   92% day over day increase in Walmart.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:40.120]   80% of Target, best buy 104%.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:42.520]   Sears, 90%.
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:46.040]   Thanksgiving day, the third highest transaction day in 2011,
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:50.480]   probably number one in 2012.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.280]   Thank you.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.360]   That's from Experian.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:54.720]   They know.
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:55.880]   Matthew Ingram, thank you so much.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:56.880]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.240]   I appreciate it, Matthew.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.080]   I know it's getting--
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.080]   Thanks for having me.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.920]   It's getting late in Toronto.
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:05.200]   As winter-- yet, is it cold there?
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:07.960]   It actually just hit yesterday, I think.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:11.120]   It had been really warm, and then all of a sudden,
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:12.840]   wammo was zero and snowing.
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:14.200]   So yes, it'll do that.
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:15.760]   It'll do that.
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:17.160]   Well, I appreciate your being here.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:20.400]   GigaOM.com is absolutely great.
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:24.520]   I'm really thrilled to have three really prestigious tech
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:25.680]   journalists on here with me.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.840]   It's nice.
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:28.280]   Harry McCracken, time.com.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.880]   That's where the technology is.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.600]   The site will now lead you.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:32.280]   Great to have you.
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.040]   Appreciate your making the trip up.
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.280]   And it's a pleasure.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.640]   Same to you, Mark Millian.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.040]   Great to see you again.
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:41.280]   Good to see you.
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.600]   And I thank you all for being here.
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:43.200]   I missed you.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.080]   I'm glad to be back.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:47.120]   Thanks once again to my filling host, Sarah Lane,
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:49.920]   and Father Robert Ballester, who did great jobs.
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:51.880]   I'm sorry I missed the alt-tech TV to it.
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:53.200]   That would have been fun.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:55.080]   I'll have to watch that one.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:57.400]   If you didn't see it, that sounds like a lot of fun.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:02.280]   Martin Sargent, Sarah Lane, David Prager, and Kevin Rose,
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:05.000]   who didn't show up.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.360]   Oh, yeah, you got it.
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.760]   We did it to it every Sunday, 3 p.m.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:11.840]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.720]   And that is 2100 UTC.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:17.120]   And I'm going to start saying Australian times now,
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:22.240]   because I know that it is five hours earlier there.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.680]   So it's 10 a.m.
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:27.080]   Sydney time.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:27.840]   Sunday morning.
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:30.120]   No, 10 a.m. Monday morning.
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:30.800]   That's the problem.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:31.800]   It's the date line thing.
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.480]   It's a different day in another country.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:36.520]   2,200 UTC.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:37.040]   All right, thank you.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:39.920]   Thank you for joining me.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.280]   And I hope you'll come back.
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:42.200]   Watch live next week.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.240]   If not, don't forget we always have on demand versions
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:46.860]   of all of our shows available on our website,
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:48.400]   twit.tv.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.280]   Yes, your chat, John.
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.120]   And we're coming up on the end of the year.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.320]   So if you would, submit your favorite picks
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:55.840]   of moments during the show.
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.560]   It could be any show whatsoever.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:00.840]   And you can submit those at twit.tv/bestof.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:03.200]   Bestof.
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:05.920]   OK, twit.tv/bestof.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:06.920]   So we're going to do that.
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.360]   We're not going to do that with all the shows.
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:09.800]   But I think some of the big shows we're going to do.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:11.480]   And also, I hear we were nominated
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:15.560]   for some sort of award, the IATW.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:16.120]   Yeah, I do.
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:18.240]   Interactive Association.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:19.440]   WTV, I think.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.800]   Of web TV.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:21.300]   Right.
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:22.880]   IATW.tv.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:25.840]   It's from the UN, isn't it?
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:28.680]   I want the UN to run web TV.
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.800]   I'm not afraid to admit it.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:35.200]   So I guess we'll find out at CES, whether we won.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.320]   But we were nominated for news, best news show.
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:37.960]   Best news show.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:41.360]   And then you were nominated for Best Host of a Live show.
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:42.000]   Wow.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:42.960]   Yes, I did.
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:45.160]   You have two nominations.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:47.160]   Thank you, Mark Million's very kind of you.
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:50.640]   The International Academy of Web Television.
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:51.640]   It's an Academy.
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:52.320]   Wow.
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.800]   So that shows you how important this is.
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.400]   The IATW.tv award.
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:01.920]   Can I get the audience to vote?
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.200]   Look, Felicia Day.
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:05.080]   I believe it's actually done by an Academy.
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:06.080]   So damn.
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:10.000]   So unfortunately, we have such a good audience
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.760]   that we can win any award if I can hit the audience to vote.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:14.440]   This is amazing.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:15.880]   Oh, well.
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:16.600]   Hey, thanks everybody.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.800]   We'll see you next week, another Twitch.
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:20.560]   He's in the can.
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.140]   (upbeat music)
