[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   It's time for Twint this week in Tech. What a great show Patrick Norton is here.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.880]   Brianna, whoo, both in studio. We're going to talk about the Baltimore City
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.840]   govern being held for ransom. Hackers probably have your social if you ever
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.080]   bought a house. And the first gaming handheld with a
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:27.200]   crank is all coming up next on Twint.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:38.400]   This is Twint.

[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.400]   It's time for Twint this week in Tech. The show we cover the week's tech news. We brought a very
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:55.040]   estimable paneling to the studio today. Patrick Norton is here. Hey. techthing.com.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.520]   This week in computer hardware and apparently the Joliet prison.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.920]   Glad you brought your souvenir. This is from your coffee mug collection, sir.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.880]   Mine says don't die stupid. Even better. Even better. Great to have you, Patrick, my old friend from
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.520]   the screen savers. Also, in studio, I've never met her before. I've only done many shows together.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.000]   Canada for US Congress and the Massachusetts 8th. Hey, Brianna. Good to be here. So nice to see you.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.160]   I know this is surreal. How do you do this without Frank moving your microphone in play?
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.920]   Right. We just show up. He's over in San Francisco. You were doing a campaign event.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.640]   I was. We obviously raise a lot of money from the Bay Area because this is the area that
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.720]   understands tech policy. Silicon Valley. They really want somebody in Congress that
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.960]   is a statistic. They really do. Absolutely. So good to go well. Yeah. It went really well.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.720]   Nice. Standing room only. So that's a good thing for campaign. Good news. Yeah.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.200]   Last year, you were primary to out this year. Same candidates. Same candidate. Professional team.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.960]   We don't like this guy, by the way. The more I hear about him, the less I like him.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   I'm not a fan. You're running against him. I am. I am. He's a Democrat, but that's- He's a
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.000]   Democrat. He's not a great Democrat. We actually raised more money from individuals than a 20
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.440]   year standing member of Congress did last quarter. I think AOC's triumph in New York is a template
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.760]   because she also beat a well-known machine, Paul. Absolutely. No one gave her a chance.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.600]   She trounced him. That's absolutely true. Yeah. And then the party circled the wagons and changed
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.280]   the rules. So it's hard for incumbents to come in. Large corporations have been paying millions
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.920]   to elect our people for years. How dare people try to represent the people at a local level.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.720]   All right. Well, there are a lot of tech stories that you will have something to say about that
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.360]   Congress can get involved in for sure. But you said, you were reading the rundown
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.480]   how blown away you were by the number of breaches we have this week. It's been a rough week for
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.400]   cybersecurity. It's terrible. The biggest one of not only the week, but of the year, I was reading
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.320]   Brian Krebs. Krebs on security does a great security blog on Friday. He tweeted, "Stand by!"
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.880]   Massive breach news. And he broke this story of First American Title. Now, I don't know if you've
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.200]   ever bought a house, but if you have, chances are pretty good that the title company, the company
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.800]   that kind of does the title insurance, maybe the escrow was First American Title. They are,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.680]   I think, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, they're a Fortune 500 company. They have 18,000
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.840]   employees. They're revenue 5.7 billion last year. So it's a big company. They had a little feature on
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:54.400]   their website. I think a lot of companies have, actually. I know a lot of sites, when you go to your
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:05.840]   account, it's got a site name, firstamerican.com/questionmarkequals. And then there's a long number, your account number.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.880]   And one of the favorite things hackers like to do is decrement or increment that, right? Well,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.400]   one down my two weeks in week, seven, three, four, nine, four, four, five, seven, two, let's try seven,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.480]   three. Turns out you can, in fact, you could, in fact, do this with the links that you were sent
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.040]   with your title information. This would be your home application, including your social security
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.480]   number, your credit history, your driver's license image, your home address, your email,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.840]   your birthday, any possible kinds of information, the kind of information you give a title company
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.480]   when you buy a home. And by the way, not just the buyer, the seller. And it turns out that record,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:58.960]   you could decrement, decrement all the way down. Brian went down to 0,000, 000, 75, which is a title
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.000]   record from 2003. And then incremented all the way up. And that's where he gets the number,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:19.920]   880,000 records. I mean, the worst breach since Yahoo. And of course,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.880]   OPM was pretty bad. OPM also, but that one went to the Chinese, right? So they never put it on the
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.320]   dark web. So hey, you're pretty secure. It's just the US government, the Chinese government. And
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.160]   you know, it's pretty safe. We don't know who, if anybody accessed this information,
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.120]   because it's been there since 2003. Yeah. Odds are pretty good. Yeah, because it's a common
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:48.720]   sound, a common technique. Yeah. It started the really sad story. As soon as Brian called them,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.080]   they turned it off. So it's fixed. But the sad story is that a developer named Ben Shovel
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.560]   found it. And he said, he tried to get ahold of first American, they just blew him off.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:11.280]   So he ended up calling Brian and Brian has a little more cloud and was able to
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.760]   get them to pull it down. But that's about as bad as you can get. 885 million plus
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.720]   stuff. Well, it also includes things like routing numbers. You know,
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.800]   but you're right. It would include bank information. Tax information. It's all out there. I mean,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.480]   I don't, you know, I've long said this. I don't think the free market can solve privacy, because
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.240]   neither the buyer nor the seller wants to pay for it. So, you know, in a situation like this,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.680]   I don't know why they shouldn't face lawsuits for this. This is so unbelievably egregious.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.640]   And like how this could go on this long without anyone, you know, like code auditing the system
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.320]   or taking a serious look at it. And the thing that really gets me about the story, Leo, is,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.560]   you know, if you look at their Twitter account, they're radio silent on it, or at least they
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.640]   were the last time I checked it. And, you know, it's just if you're going to put everyone else's
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.120]   information at risk with this, they're just keeping their head down and waiting for it to blow over.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.960]   They also might simply be so completely gobsmacked. I mean, it's interesting, right? Because, you
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.560]   know, one of the other big stories this week, of course, the attack on Baltimore. Baltimore's
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.880]   been shut down for like three weeks climbing up from a ransomware attack. But we'll get into
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.120]   that in a minute. You know, but half of what's going on right now, you know, when a lot of these
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.400]   attacks come out is the first thing they have to do is figure out if anything's been leaked,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.320]   can they trace it, can they find information has been out there, they circle the lawyers. And this,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.760]   I mean, you could look at your, your web logs, if you had them going back and see when those pages
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.200]   were accessed, how many times they were accessed. And if they were accessed a long time after the
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.520]   transaction, that kind of thing, that would be a giveaway. Assuming the crack team that put
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.400]   together the website also kept on their logs. And I apologize if anyone out there is part of that
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.680]   crack team. No, no, the CEO of First America has paid $8 million last year. You could take the hit.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.600]   Competency and taking care of your customers has nothing to do with executive compensation.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.880]   Let's get that straight right now. I love this statement released by First American.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.480]   You might might sound familiar. First American at First American security, privacy,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.560]   and confidentiality are of the highest priority. Unless we have to do anything.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.920]   We are committed to protecting our customers' information. As long as it doesn't cost anything.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.080]   We will have no further comment until our internal review is completed. Because our lawyers are
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:40.960]   freaking the delete expert about it. Your information is important to us. Please, hang on.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.720]   We can't make the $5.7 billion a year we make if you don't continue to give us staggering amounts
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.880]   of information. They also could be trying to figure out, you know, can they fix it? What else is wrong?
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.200]   They probably have pen testing teams in there screaming through everything they can. Right.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.640]   Because now that the horse is out, they should probably rebuild the fence in the barn. But this was
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.040]   not the sad thing is really, I mean, maybe they were also penetrated. But this didn't require a
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.440]   spearfishing attack and advanced persistence. Just a web browser pretty much is all you need.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.360]   I mean, why is it so important about this? As I've started running for office.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.960]   Liability, please.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.480]   Liability. Absolutely. We need liability laws on this. But I've talked to so many people that work
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.160]   on the infosec teams at these large corporations. And they've talked to me about why these disasters
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   happen. It's typically not because the people in charge of the security architecture or
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.360]   inept or they don't care. The truth is they're not supported by upper management.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.440]   So they'll go to management and say, we got a problem.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.160]   Correct. And they get blown off and they don't have the resources. This is why I feel it's so
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   critical that we up the legal liability there when it's more expensive to do this wrong
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.000]   than it is to do it right. That's when you'll see them take this seriously.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.640]   Of course it does. Although putting a password on each of those pages wouldn't have been that
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.920]   hard. Now it wouldn't have. I think the code monkey could have done that that day.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:10.000]   In Baltimore and beyond, this is the New York Times today. This is actually a great,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.720]   great writing from the New York Times credit to Nicole, Pearl, Roth, and Scott Shane.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   As you know, Baltimore for three weeks now has been shut down by ransomware. It's frozen thousands
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.400]   of computers shut down. Email disrupted real estate sales, water bills,
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.680]   health alerts, and other services. Here's the bullet and they put on the City of Baltimore webpage.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   The City of Baltimore is currently unable to send or receive email. If you need assistance, call us.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:44.720]   The ransom $100,000 city officials to their credit refused to pay it.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   And aside, no, we just I just read an article. I think it was on Motherboard that a lot of the
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:57.120]   companies that get hired to remediate ransomware. What do they do? They pay the fine. They add 10,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:05.360]   20% for profit. Really job done. Oh, so do not pay the Bitcoin ransamists. Okay, I'm just saying.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.520]   But here is what this is the great writing again from the New York Times, Pearl, Roth, and Shane.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.960]   Here's what frustrated city employees and residents do not know. A key component of the malware that
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   cyber criminals use in the attack was developed at taxpayer expense. A short drive down the Baltimore
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:28.880]   Washington Parkway at the National Security Agency. This is peace evident. This is eternal blue.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.760]   You remember the shadow brokers leak of a bunch of NSA exploits some years ago. I mean,
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.200]   never really, and it's ain't ever really explained how it happened. Although if you piece it together,
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.600]   it sounded like an NSA contractor decided to take those files home with him. So not so he could
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.160]   steal them, but so he could work at home. He was running a kaspersky antivirus on his machine.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:54.320]   One of the things Kaspersky does is quarantine threats, whether intentionally or not Kaspersky
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.400]   recognized that the guy had a bunch of really good hacks on his machine. So they quarantine him
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:08.400]   and send him back to the home office, which happens to be in Moscow. The Russian secret police apparently
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   have people working at Kaspersky. It's unknown how close Kaspersky is to the Russian secret police,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.520]   but they certainly have access to those quarantine files and the rest is history.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.720]   The thing I said on the radio show today, I think this and I wanted regular people here,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:31.520]   not geeks, is this is the problem. The NSA, the top spy agency in the United States,
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.320]   the most security focus, these guys really know their stuff, couldn't keep this stuff
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.880]   internal for long. And you want us to put back doors in all the encryption.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.400]   Thank you. Right. Right. If you can't keep these secrets, are you going to keep the back door
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.080]   secret? You can't. Well, you couldn't even if you didn't sell. So what that means is anything,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:01.200]   any weakness you put in any software is eventually going to be used by bad guys against the United
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.160]   States. And this is Leo, this is where I really want to give Microsoft credit,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.920]   because they really took a risk in moving forward. And they came out. We should say
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.640]   eternal blue is an SMB exploit. It's like an old version of SMB, Microsoft's
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:22.320]   file sharing. Sure. Absolutely. But their legal team has come forward. And they've had a lot to
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:29.920]   say about the NSA stockpiling zero day weapons and talking about how we need to have a national ban
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.040]   on them doing that. Because what happens is these zero days are out there. It prevents people
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:41.600]   from patching it. And rather than kind of using this for cyber warfare and being able to use it
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   to get their own way, we should have them working proactively with Microsoft with other architecture
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.400]   to plug these holes and address it because it's exactly, as you said, it's just going to get,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.080]   you know, weaponized against the American people from the same article, eternal blue,
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.960]   the SMB exploit that allowed these malware programs to be more mobile so that it's one thing. If you
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.520]   get one computer in the Baltimore city government with ransomware, but what happens is it worm uses
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.080]   eternal blue to worm its way to all the computers. Yeah. Eternal blue was so valuable. Former
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:18.400]   NSA employees said that the agency never seriously considered alerting Microsoft about the vulnerabilities
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.480]   and held on to it for more than five years before the breach forced its head. The breach was two
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:32.880]   years ago. So for seven years that SMB won flaws existed. Right. So but Brianna, let me please,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:43.120]   how are you? Clearly, you know, national warfare struggles espionage is all going to become cyber
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:54.160]   based. That's where we're headed. Right. If our NSA is not allowed to develop tools to do cyber
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:01.200]   warfare, then aren't we tying both hands behind our back? I think it's a good argument for that.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.040]   Have you read Countdown to Zero Day about Stuxnet source? It's a great book. It's a fantastic book.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.680]   And I won't like go into all the details, but I will say the the technical wizardry that they
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.640]   use to basically shut down the centrifuges in Iran, it was brilliant. Like it's a it's certainly
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:26.800]   that kind of cyber warfare is going to go lives were lost, but it's kind of an optimal solution,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.280]   but there was a collateral a lot of collateral damage because this worm was spread all over
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:38.160]   the world. So look, I'm not right. If you fire up a windows machine that is not patched for Stuxnet,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   you will get it. Yes, you will. It's endemic on the net. It just constantly out right.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.280]   Absolutely. So this isn't all or nothing, Lea. Right. Like it's we live in a dangerous world.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.800]   We do need to take this seriously, but in this particular case, the NSA was unable to keep this
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   safe and I would invite you to say five years until somebody who deserves to get there is no
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.400]   patch for a human stupidity t-shirt decided to take to do work from home. If you're working
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.360]   at the NSA, you don't take I'm pretty sure I mean, I could be wrong rules may have changed. I don't
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.000]   know anybody the NSA that well, but we spent I got to spend a couple like a day with the NSA.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.160]   They have some pretty they're they're uptight people. Right. They're really uptight.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:23.920]   And they have rules in place. And I'm pretty sure didn't stop Edward Snowden and then several
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.760]   years later, did not stop. Well, there is no patch for humans that could be the short version.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.480]   Right. You know, until the government is not run by humans, I think we've got a problem.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.320]   I feel like we're not going to give up developing these tools. Right. Right. But I think there is
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:45.200]   an analog here and that is biologic weapons. So there is also a lot of incentive for governments
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.600]   to create biological weapons. But we have a I don't know if it's Geneva Convention, but we
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.720]   have an agreement among governments that they won't do it. And the reason is these pathogens that
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:02.080]   probably do exist in labs, I'm thinking, should they get out would wipe out the population of the
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.680]   country? Right. So so there are restrictions on this kind of warfare. Maybe we need
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   even is it even possible to get people like Iran, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, China, Russia to agree
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:22.320]   to some sort of cyber moratorium? I think if you're talking to people at the NSA, if you're
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.760]   talking to info sec experts, they are talking about this. The United States cannot go it alone
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.480]   and solve these kinds of problems. If we're talking about truly unilaterally disarming,
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.320]   if we do exactly. So we've got to do exactly what you're talking about. Form
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.680]   form alliances with other nations. We're so good at that right now. Well, it's not great.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:48.480]   We could change that. We can change that. So, you know, the truth is we just can't isolate
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:55.200]   ourselves. We need to engage with other people. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's so tempting to say,
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.560]   well, but this is all this is all this is all one giant mess. You know, for example,
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.120]   I am fine. He's cryptography. Fundamentally. I don't know how she doesn't get it. I don't know
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.040]   if she I think she totally gets it, but her priorities in terms of, you know, national security,
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.080]   that's much more important to her than than maybe not every bank account in the planet getting
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.880]   hacked. I mean, it's it's, you know, the the prior you talked to people at different levels of
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.320]   government. I mean, one of the fun things about Defcon is who you run into drunk at two in the
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.600]   morning. Yeah. And people who are at the front lines have a very different perspective from people
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.200]   at home. And if somebody spends their entire day, well, you know, we get, you know, we get hit by
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.880]   this, we get hit by this, we get hit by this, we get hit by this, and people are constantly,
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   the whole cyber warfare thing, you know, there's little skirmishes going on all the time. There's
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.640]   all sorts of mayhem going on. Just I just read an article about there's a little island off of
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:56.480]   Manhattan that we do practice cyber attacks on the grid. And it was just in the times today, I think.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:02.240]   And and every six months they bring down the grid and see how fast we can get it back on this island
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.480]   that nobody's allowed to visit. It's a private, you know, military installation.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.960]   I just want to bounce off what you were saying with that Diane Feinstein. You know,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.480]   she voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act. She voted to basically, she's very against cryptography.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.320]   In my experience, I think it's faulty thinking to think any particular political party is going
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.640]   to come to your rescue on this issue. When I talk to people, I'm not talking about political
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.000]   party. I'm talking about one of the senators of the state. It's going to be as
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.080]   diametrically opposed to the companies that generate the majority of the revenue. Absolutely.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.120]   And in her state, and a lot of the citizens, I'm writing as a Democrat. I think it's time to,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.960]   for us to have a conversation saying we have not been good on this issue. And the axis of conflict
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.160]   here isn't one political party versus another. It's informed versus uninformed.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.280]   Yeah. And then we just need to figure out how to separate all the special interests.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.160]   It's not just the US though. And that's the real problem. Because
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:04.080]   Eternal Blue was first used by the North Koreans. They used it to bring down the British hospital
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:10.640]   system, the national health system. That was the first use of it. They brought down German railroads,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:17.440]   200 organizations, 200,000 organizations around the world. Russia used it with not Pecha. So
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.000]   North Korea had WannaCray, which used Eternal Blue. Not Pecha used Eternal Blue. It was aimed
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.200]   at Ukraine. But it ended up leaking out FedEx, cost them 400 million, Merck cost them 670 million.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.360]   So these companies could reasonably lobby and say, look, we got to do something.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.840]   But I think you also have to convince these countries. And I think it's a case of you have to say
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.920]   the damage, the collateral damage to your and promise, how do you convince North Korea?
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.160]   Yeah, here's this. Here's the island, by the way. Have you ever been to Plum Island, Patrick?
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.680]   No. Off-long island sound? No. Well, you can't go there. Good.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:58.400]   And it's where DARPA runs war games for a massive cyber attack. Oh my goodness.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:04.960]   Yeah. It's owned by the Department of Homeland Security. Major attractions are a defunct lighthouse
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.080]   and a center that studies infectious animal diseases. Strangely, though, their power goes out every
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:17.440]   six months. It's an exercise. I suspect they fire up the generators, the generators before they
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.760]   they run the board. They should kill the power on the bow. No. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Well,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:30.320]   I think they probably warned them ahead of time. So every six months DARPA fairies,
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:36.160]   over experts on a ferry and a boat who worked to jumpstart a dead grid while
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.200]   warding off a series of cyber threats. At least we're war gaming this stuff. We're preparing.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:48.560]   I can't tell you, Leah, I've had some scary conversations that share with people. Have you
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.840]   kind of secret deep, deep backgrounds? Well, I would just say sometimes you try to talk to
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.040]   people in positions of power about this and you expect there to be a certain amount of
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.560]   technological literacy and my experience is when it's not quite there.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.240]   Here's the other issue. North Korea is like the battle star Galactica.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:14.400]   Right? Yes. You know what I'm saying? They've cut themselves off from modern technology.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.560]   So you can't really say to them, or you got to watch out, want to cry, could bite you too.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:24.000]   No, it can't. Oh, so we just do an EMP above the country. Oh, don't say that, Patrick.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.880]   People think you're serious, although they're not serious. They also would affect them.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.440]   It wouldn't affect them. They're the battle star freaking Galactica.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.640]   They're using phones with wires and dials. We'll talk about EMPs later.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.200]   We'll break those two. Does it break a fine Western electric phone made of hard rubber?
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.040]   That's a really good question. I bet it doesn't.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.480]   I've been no neutron bomb. We'll blast that out of the sky.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.840]   So the Department of Homeland Security last year issued a dire warning
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.320]   that state and local governments are getting hit by a particularly destructive malware
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.560]   that is relying on eternal blue. Microsoft, this is the Microsoft Center,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.360]   the eternal blue tracking center. Notice they have one of those fine surface hub.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.400]   Mostly I just like that at least one person's wearing a camouflage thing.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:17.280]   You can't see me. I'm invisible right now. You don't know where I am.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.120]   This feels kind of staged. I don't know. Maybe it's just me.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.560]   It looks kind of staged. But it's funny because there's a blog
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.160]   that I love to read called "Green Ole Shagand." What he talks about mostly is how things are
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:40.400]   evolving in communities and why Big Box. He walks through the sort of how towns and cities
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.320]   got to where they are with the ex-urban production and then how Big Box stores are dying and this
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.000]   sort of endless series of rings. I understand. That's what it's coming in.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.520]   They can barely run their own infrastructure without having to deal with upgrading.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.280]   Welcome to Petaluma where the housing office is open four hours a week.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.040]   Good luck getting a permit. The streets are decaying because nobody has the money to fill the
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:08.800]   potholes and this is a typical excerpt, small town. I can't imagine what the cybersecurity is
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.000]   in city hall. The answer is like not Korea. They don't have a network. Hello?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.280]   The answer is obviously that there's not going to be any Leo and this is why there's very clearly
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:28.080]   a federal role to play in securing this. If the NSA is going to stockpile these weapons,
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.360]   we need to have a process to be able to get emergency patches out. That's why I do think we
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.200]   need to be funding free and open source software for local city governments to use.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.720]   Maybe that's one solution. Stop using proprietary software.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:50.400]   It's a nightmare. It locks all these. OpenSSH was a mess for, we found out it had been a mess for years.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:57.120]   Fair point. As I've gotten to know every single independent government, they get locked into a
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.320]   different contract with another vendor, then you've got technical debt and you can't swim and swap
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.080]   it over. This is clearly a case for federal leadership. The last thing I would say is I forget
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.000]   what year it was exactly. Was it '94 that we closed down the Office of Technology assessment
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.680]   in Washington? It makes no sense. It makes no sense.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.280]   A very well run agency that was helping members of Congress understand technology.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:31.520]   Now they've got nothing. Now they've got Jack Dorsey. In an interview in March, Michael Rogers,
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   the admiral who was in charge of the NSA during the leak, said this. Well, I don't think he said,
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.840]   "Well, but he's thinking it." If Toyota makes pickup trucks and someone takes a pickup truck
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.600]   and wells an explosive device into the front and crashes it through a perimeter into a crowd of
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.280]   people, is that Toyota's responsibility? The NSA wrote an exploit that was never designed to do
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:27:02.240]   what was done. Yeah, no. Yeah, it was. It's exactly what it was. Yeah. I couldn't think.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.600]   Microsoft's response, Tom Burt, Corporate Vice President of Consumer Trust,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:13.440]   said you can't compare cyber weapons to pickup trucks or the NSA to Toyota.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.520]   Yeah. These exploits are developed and kept secret by governments. This is exactly what you
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.360]   were saying, Brianna. For the express purpose of using them as weapons or espionage tools,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.400]   they're inherently dangerous. When someone takes that, they're not strapping a bomb to it. It is
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.240]   already a bomb. Yeah, I was going to say this is more like if somebody finds a bomb
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.040]   outside, like on the front lawn that fell off the NSA truck and then welds it onto their pickup
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:40.320]   truck, then I'm kind of getting the analogy. But it's it's so there is. I didn't know this, but at
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.680]   the end of the article, last year, Microsoft, along with Google and Facebook joined 50 countries
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:52.240]   and signing on to a call by French President Emmanuel Macron, the Paris call for trust and security
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.920]   in cyberspace to end malicious cyber activities in peacetime. So 50 countries sign it, but who
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.200]   didn't sign it? China, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, and the United States. Right.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:08.160]   So the biggest actors, the ones that are most likely to get into a scrap, are not participating.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.000]   And I understand why, because they say, but we don't want our hands time off of course.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.640]   I it's not how I would go. It makes us more unsafe to not be working with other people.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:24.880]   I think that there is an eternal optimism in these agencies that no, no, no, this time
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.800]   will keep it to ourselves. This time, nobody's going to get this time. It's going to be fun.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.040]   This time, it's going to be fun. I really think that that's how they that's how they think, right?
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.600]   We figured it out. We're not we're locked it down. You don't worry. It's going to be our
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:45.280]   right. More often, it's more like, wait, what happened? What? He did what? Excuse me? Like,
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.760]   for some reason, I'm not sure exactly why. So Baltimore City officials,
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:56.160]   because they couldn't use their system, started using Gmail and Google shut them out.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:04.560]   It's because apparently the security systems detected the creation of several accounts in
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.760]   a short period of time and shut them down. But Google is happy to say we restored access to the
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.960]   Gmail accounts for the Baltimore City officials. It's because they created a million accounts all
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:22.000]   at once. So just next time that happens to your city, slow, make one every 15 minutes.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.640]   I think that's a valid edge case. I know. Yes.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:33.280]   All right. Oh, there's one more I got to do. This is an example of why we're screwed.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:41.600]   So the Air Force is investigating the Navy. I saw this. I couldn't believe it.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.720]   For a cyber intrusion into its network, this is a memo obtained by the military times.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:52.960]   Apparently, a Navy prosecutor decided to embed hidden tracking software into emails
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   sent to defense attorneys, including an Air Force lawyer involved in a high profile war crimes
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.000]   case of a Navy SEAL in San Diego. The tracking device was an attempt to find out who was leaking
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.800]   information to the editor of Navy times, a sister publication of the military times.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:15.520]   It was also sent to Carl Prine, the Navy Times editor. So the Air Force is treating this malware
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:22.560]   as cyber intrusion on their network and have seized the Air Force Individual Military Council's
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:29.040]   computer and phone for review. It's like that Spider-Man meme where they're both pointing each other.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.200]   The Air Force is accusing the Navy of cyber warfare.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.840]   There's no hope, Brianna. Are you sure you want to run for Congress?
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:44.000]   I do. I had to say there, though, like trying to figure out information late for military,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.960]   you know, use that's not an unreasonable use of that kind of technology to me. I mean,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.080]   that's high stakes there. They also define what it is.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.680]   Because this could be just as benign as something that calls like a lot of one
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.880]   an invisible pixel or a lot of, like, for example, a lot of companies or PR companies or sales teams,
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.920]   they actually automatically track the email they send out so they know if you open it,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:14.160]   if you respond to it, it's incredibly common. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people use that.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.120]   I want to be there for that. I want to be there for the jag argument.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:29.120]   Let's take a break. Great to have you, Brianna Wu, visiting our little, our fair coast,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:37.120]   running for Congress, US Congress, Massachusetts, 8th. Brianna, of course, is a famous game developer,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.760]   but we don't call her Space Cat Galan anymore. My team made me change that.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.120]   It would not be appropriate. She is @Brianna Wu on the Twitter.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.840]   But do you still, do you do any technology stuff? I mean, are you still running that company?
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.640]   I wish. I hope we got you guys to talk about Playdate today. I saw that. It uses Lua.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.880]   I want to like learn that so I can come to it. Lua is cool. Yeah. Lua is really a cool language.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.720]   It seems very easy to do. Yeah. It's kind of a nice scripting language. A lot of stuff.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.240]   Photo Lightroom is written in Lua. Oh, really? Yeah. A lot of stuff.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:12.880]   Wow. You know that you see that a lot where these low level, no, these programs are using
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.640]   internal scripting languages because then it's easier to, you know, it's like Zork.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.160]   Right. Right. You don't want to write that from scratch. You create these Zork interpreter
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.600]   language and then you write it. I don't even know where to go with that. It's a DSL, a domain
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.760]   specific language and Lua didn't, I don't think it started. Maybe it did start that way.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:38.400]   We're thinking about putting out a game. We have it nearly done basically about information warfare.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.360]   Oh. It's basically simulated. It's an opportunity. Yeah.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.440]   To use the crank on the Playdate? Yeah. Well, not with the Playdate. This would be for iPhone.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.960]   That would be fun. But it's basically, it's about information warfare and, you know,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.760]   paid trolls and botnets and all of that to kind of say, hey, this is a serious problem.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.080]   We're very, we have it written. It's just getting it out there. I signed up immediately
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.760]   for the Playdate. I did too. It looks so good. Yeah. We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:09.360]   We got three Playdate. We could have a Playdate. Such a good day. It'll just be two hours of us
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.960]   cracking your handle. So our show today brought to you by my mattress. You know, I love Casper.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:22.000]   I love my Casper for years. Casper is a sleep brand that was the first to say, first to realize
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.760]   that the market mattress stores were making was more than 100%. And the only benefit was you could
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.600]   lie in the mattress for five minutes in the broad daylight while salesperson looked at you like,
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.720]   what are you doing? Take your shoes off. Let alone really trying a mattress for what it's intended
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:48.320]   for. I'll let you fill in that sense. But honestly, they said, we don't have to do this. We could sell
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.600]   direct to consumers. Some bright boy said, well, yeah, but wait, how are they going to decide
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.920]   whether they like it? And they came up with this brilliant plan. Here's the new Casper mattress.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:02.720]   I'm about to open it. They said, like my jammies? Great Casper.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.720]   They said, well, what if we let people try it in their house for 100 days? This is the brand new
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.120]   hybrid mattress collection. Now rewind this for a second because I'm going to tell you something
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:24.000]   and you're not going to believe it. So, wait a minute, don't rewind it. That is comfort. Isn't that nice?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.480]   With your LLB sheep slippers off. You recognize those, didn't you? They're wicked. They're wicked
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.920]   good slippers. I have those too. Yeah. They're so the best. So let me tell you something about this
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:41.360]   mattress. This is very different because in the past, Casper mattresses have combined foam and
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:50.400]   a variety of materials. He's really creepy. He's dead. Oh, he's not dead. I got the kitty. I got
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:35:00.480]   the kitty. Kitty liked it too. That's Sammy. Okay, I really thought they would fast forward this. I
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:06.000]   didn't think it would go this slow. I'm just saying. I don't know what channel this is.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.640]   He's like, what is going on? Who's that guy? The police. What does he have a mattress in his
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:19.680]   foyer? So the deal is Casper is now making a new kind of mattress, the hybrid mattress collection,
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.800]   which combines the pressure relief of their award-winning foam. But get this, it has springs.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.760]   What durable but gentle springs doesn't mean you still can't fit it in that surprisingly compact
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:37.520]   box. It doesn't mean you can't open it up just like I did and open it. You take it out of the
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.120]   bag. They must have one of those giant vacuum machines you have for when you got a lot of meat.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:50.320]   It's the size of a mattress. I have the small one too, but I want a mattress-sized one. So they
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:56.880]   suck all the air out. So it's really compact. The new hybrid mattress collection, I have to tell you,
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.520]   is the best Casper I've ever slept on. It offers luxurious, comfort, and resilient support,
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.120]   elevated lift for active support, durability for all body types. Here's something I really like.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.960]   So on some mattresses, when you're trying to get out of the bed, I don't know if you've noticed this,
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:16.480]   the edge is not stiff. So the mattress, as you're getting out of bed, collapses.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:23.200]   You sort of slide on. It rolls you up. So they've got enhanced edge support. It has a firmer perimeter.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:28.160]   So if you've ever had that experience, this supports you as you're getting out of bed.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:32.720]   A security tub. It's like, yes, you have an edge. You could press up again. I don't know how to
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.200]   describe it, but it's awesome. You get out of the lift from the springs. They're still open-cell
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.120]   foam, so it sleeps cool, which is really important. You don't want a hot mattress.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.240]   The coils are, of course, individual. So the air can flow around them, but also you can sleep next
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.880]   to somebody and each have your own kind of comfort zone. I think this is the best mattress they've
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:00.160]   ever made. It's so soft and comfortable. The only sad thing is we already had the Casper,
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.280]   and foolishly, I told my brother-in-law, "Oh, we're getting one, but you can have it."
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.760]   So by the way, it's gone. He took it within a minute.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:15.520]   Showing Debbie, it's gone. I said, "Where'd it go?" Oh, no, they took it. So now I want to get
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.000]   another one. You gave it to them. Well, I have the original Casper, which I love. I did give it
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.800]   to him. I didn't know how much I'd like this one. Have you tried the Glo light? Have you seen that?
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:33.360]   No. That's so cool. It's not a mattress. It's a light Casper cells. It's hard to describe,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.880]   but you can lift it up off. It's not connected to anything. It's got a battery,
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.200]   and it glows, and it will dim down as you're going to sleep. Then in the morning, it slowly
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.800]   comes up like the sun. Slowly comes up. If you have to go to the bathroom, you pick it up,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.240]   and you shake it, and it gives you a very dim glow that you can get to the bathroom and back.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.120]   Oh my gosh. It's hard to describe. It's really, anyway. I think this is like a side business,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.400]   but that just shows you they've got engineering to spare. A lot of brains, because you know why
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.520]   they got brains? They get good night's sleep. If you don't get a good night's sleep, you're not
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:09.680]   thinking solid. Here's the deal. You can get $100 towards select mattresses when you go to
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:15.520]   Casper.com/twit1. Use a promo code "twit1." I should say, I didn't mention the most important
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.080]   part. You got 100 days to sleep on this. If you say, at any time of those 100 days,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.280]   "I want to go back to my own mattress," they come and get it. You don't have to fit back in the box,
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:32.560]   because unlike Patrick, we don't have mattress-sized vacuum sealers. They come and they get it,
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.400]   and they refund you every penny, so there's literally no risk. 100 days to sleep on it.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.920]   I love this new hybrid. This is tri... Well, yeah, try it out. I guess that's what you say.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.200]   Free deliveries and painless returns in the US and Canada. A 100-night risk-free sleep on a trial.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.240]   You got to love Casper. They just keep... They knock it out of the park and continue to do so.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.600]   Save $100 towards select mattresses by going to Casper.com/twit1, entering the promo code "twit1"
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:04.320]   to check out terms and conditions apply. Thank you, Casper. Thank you for a good night's sleep.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.000]   I really... There's nothing like it. I thank you for supporting us by using that URL.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.240]   Casper.com/twit1, promo code "twit1". So you brought up so we can talk about it.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.320]   Yes! The first gaming console with a crank.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:24.640]   This is... I love this. First of all, it's from Panic Software, who I have loved for years,
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.080]   because they do transmit and Koda. They're a Mac software company.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.280]   Yeah. Not a hardware company, a Mac software company.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.360]   And then came Firewatch. Firewatch, yeah. What's Firewatch? They do that? Is that hardware?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.680]   Yeah, they made Firewatch. It's a game. Just go home and buy. When you're done with the show,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   it's a game you can play. It's a software. So it's not like a very competitive shooter game.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:53.120]   It's a story-based game that is slower and it's... Meditated. It's very meditated.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.840]   Takes place in the Wyoming wilderness. It's fourth-year time.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.560]   Oh, okay. So they obviously like Casper. They have engineering cycles to spare.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:07.920]   So when they're not writing $50-60 FTP software, which by the way, Panic transmit,
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.800]   it's a must-have. Very much worth it. It doesn't break. It's like, wait, wait, are you
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.360]   saying developers should make money so that they can eat and continue to buy an excellent software?
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   Yeah, but who would think you could... You have every computer comes with FTP built in,
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.960]   and yet. And yet, I bought it. I've always... I love all of this.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.440]   But part of what's crazy about Playdate is the idea there's the console. It's like 100
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.200]   console, the handheld, whatever we call it. It's a yellow... It's a game voice.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.760]   It's black and white screen. It's kind of eink, I hear. And they're going to do a flight of...
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.320]   It's a high resolution black and white screen. Just let that settle in for a second.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.040]   Where do you even find a high resolution black and white screen?
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.960]   But with the price, which is not cheap, by the way. It's 150 bucks.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.360]   Okay, I guess that's kind of cheap. You drop that at dinner how many nights a week?
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:02.640]   Tonight. But it comes with... They're calling like a season or a flight of 12 games. One a
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.160]   month for a year. Is that right? Is it worth... No, it's like one of them all at once.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.840]   Yeah, they're going to release once a week. They already paid people to develop these
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.600]   little mini games. Some are long, some are short, some are experimental, some are traditional.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   But like... You want to write it because it's in Lua. You could write one.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.200]   Yeah, I thought it would be a lot of fun. It would be fun. Now I want to write one.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:25.840]   What am I complaints about the video game industry? I work with Unreal, which is a giant,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:34.560]   unwieldy engine. I really feel like with creativity, limits really help you make a better product.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.880]   Like I always think about that. If you ever seen Dr. No, the original James Bond movie,
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:45.600]   that great first set in there where Dr. Strangway's comes in, it's got that great light on him,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.880]   that terrify is just a table and a room and the light up there. That happened because they ran
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:57.520]   out of money for that. It's the most striking shot with that. Limitations can really help
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:05.440]   creativity. So the way I feel is, I was looking on my PlayStation 4 and looking for games to buy
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:11.520]   this month. I'm bored with everything, our industry is shipping. And I just really loved this idea
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:19.760]   about putting out a really small graphically bad handheld that's all about the gameplay in
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:25.200]   these cute little gimmicks. I think it'll be fun. One game a week for 12 weeks, a little LED flash
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:31.360]   is when a new game comes out. You have no idea what it's going to be. The Crankins Time Travel
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:38.560]   Adventure is basically the guy that developed Katamara Damasi. And it's just like, and the
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.480]   list of game developers they have is really, really cool. Apparently they're doing a game
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.080]   too called Untitled Goose Game. It's an lovely morning in the village and you are a horrible
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:57.040]   goose. Oh, this is like that goat game. I like the goat game. It's a game by House House.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   Is that the Quap people? All right. Here it is, the Untitled Goose Game. I love the name,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.240]   by the way. It's coming to the Switch and computers. So the panic sounds like panic did not
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.920]   write this, but they're publishing it. That's what it looks like. It's a very interesting business
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.280]   model. Are they Australian? I feel like they are. I don't know. I don't know. I don't.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:20.240]   I don't know. Play day? Or do you mean panic? Yeah. They're in Portland. Oh, close.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.720]   Yeah, it's sick everybody like Australia, but just north of us.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:31.440]   About 11 hours. Wetter. I could walk there. What does it popular? They have a soccer team.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.280]   They're still somewhat upside down.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:41.280]   So this is a bad goose. I love the graphic style. Looks a little like 10-10 or something.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:47.840]   And the music. So anyway, I do think I completely agree with you that it's nice to know that there's
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:55.680]   room for kind of indie, quirky indie stock creativity. Right. And the budget to develop
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.160]   something like this, like there's a hard limit to how much that's going to be on something like
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:05.520]   Play Day. Yeah. I mean, 150 bucks. You can't really, you can't make money. You can't do much
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:11.360]   with that. I do think it's worth saying, you know, they haven't really established a dev
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.840]   pipeline to get on the device. They haven't really talked about the store, how that will work.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.240]   There are a lot of questions left about this device. Kind of like a Kickstarter.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   Yeah. Except they didn't ask for money yet. You can only only your email address.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:31.120]   Turns out, according to the way and gadget, Facebook tried to buy panic, but failed.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:38.080]   This is actually in Edge magazine. So let me actually let me go to the Edge story since they
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:47.520]   came up with this. It's deep within the story, apparently. But let me see. Oh, wait a minute.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.720]   Here's something brought to life by renowned Swedish industrial design firm Teenage Engineering.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.360]   So that's who's designing the Play Day. That's who designed basically came up with the idea for
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:06.000]   the crank. So the crank is a UI. It's a, you got the normal plus button and then, you know,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.240]   the cross keys and then the normal AB keys, but there's crank and they say the crank will be,
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.520]   gameplay will involve the crank. I suspect that's going to get very gimmicky, very quickly. Like
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:23.520]   the 3DS 3D screen. I don't see a lot of people using that. They got Amy Henning, who did the co-creator
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:32.160]   of the driving games. That's true. What game? What do you up your car before you get? What do you use
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:38.240]   the crank for? It's a steering wheel. Okay. Just think of it as any game that you
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:49.680]   use a joystick in a circular fashion. I think like old time movie camera guy. See how still you
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.560]   can keep the camera while you're cranking the film. Well, it's interesting, but the first game is
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:01.120]   they're using the crank to allow their character to move slower or faster than real time while all
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.760]   of the obstacles are coming at the character. Oh, so it could be like a time-changer. Yeah, it
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:12.320]   literally is a sort of time shifting game. But I mean, it's also, again, I've got, okay, two buttons,
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:17.600]   a thumb pad and a crank. What can we do with this? Right. Right. It's exciting to start thinking
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:26.240]   about that. So the crank is a D-pad, but it can be used as a D-pad with not with no up and down.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.000]   I think you're overthinking this. I'm just trying to think of uses.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.120]   Yeah, I hope I get one. I mean, I imagine they're going to be sold out very quickly, right? Play
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:42.560]   dot date if you want to quickly get on the list. It's yellow. It fits in your pocket. It's got a
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.880]   beautiful black and white screen. It's not super cheap, but it's not super expensive. It
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.640]   includes brand new games from some amazing creators. Plus it has a crank.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:58.080]   It's very Swedish. I don't, you know, I'm very poor.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   Portland. Portland. The designers from Sweden. Didn't I just say that? I thought I just say that.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:12.720]   Yeah. Save that. I saved that. Okay. Fascinating. And you want to write games with this, Brianna,
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.040]   because if I have time, you'll be sitting in Congress in the house. I know what's going to happen.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.760]   You're going to be sitting there. You're going to stop by the candy desk,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.160]   picked up some candy. You're sitting there. They're waiting for a cloture vote. You're going to,
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.360]   we're going to see you on C-SPAN. Wait a minute. What is going on down there?
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:36.960]   Is representative Wu? Is she cranking something? What is going on? The Sergeant in Arms is coming
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:43.120]   over. I don't know. You're going to have to get a permission to bring it. I think, is there
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.440]   limits of what you really want to know? If you get elected and you're wandering by the desks during
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.960]   a vote, how many people are playing games under the desk? How do you want to know?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.960]   How do you want to know? You want to bust every one of them.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.560]   We want the story. That's the insight. This is what I want you to think about. A speech
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:02.320]   and how many final fantasy references I will drop to the speech. Oh, I would vote for you just for
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.640]   that. It's going to be great. You know that the Pat Naswald thing where he comes out?
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:13.760]   Azilda once told me. Like the epic Star Wars Star Trek crossover that he does to
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.520]   filibuster a Trek thing. I'm going to do that. It's going to be great.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.840]   It's going to be so good. I hope to.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:25.440]   Twenty-two hours and we're up to the beginning of chapter two. I hope to God you get elected.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:32.160]   I just think this is going to be very exciting. All right. We had a little, that was a little
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.640]   Amuz Bush, a little Sorbet, a little refresher. A pallet cleanser. A pallet cleanser in between
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:45.760]   the havoc that is today's Tech News. We mentioned last week that grinder,
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:52.240]   that the Cepheus, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States,
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:59.360]   is ordering the Chinese company that bought grinder some years ago to sell them.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.720]   And in the meantime, not to put give any data to the Chinese.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:13.040]   Well, now we know why. It turns out that Beijing Kunlun Tech Company, which took control in January
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:22.080]   of last year, stepped up management changes, consolidated operations, cut costs. In the process,
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:27.520]   some of the companies, engineers in Beijing got access to the grinder database for a few months.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:34.880]   Now, grinder, in case you don't know, is a gay dating app. It's Tinder for gay people.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:43.520]   And of course, I think the real concern is blackmail. If you're a closeted member of Congress or in
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.160]   the defense. Well, it also includes information on HIV status. And there's a lot of incredibly
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.840]   good information. Very personal. It could be used against you. It could be used for blackmail. It
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.640]   could be all sorts of things. So I agree it should be sold. But I think now we know that the
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:04.400]   security was very lax. Reuters, which reported this, found no evidence the apps database was
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:10.800]   misused. Nevertheless, the decision to give engineers and Beijing access to grinder's database was,
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:17.760]   well, a misstep. And that was one of the reasons Cepheus said, "Yeah, you're going to be selling that."
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.840]   I mean, I think that's very clearly a valid worry that people could be blackmailed or
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:27.040]   extorted about that. And it's not just grinder. That's not the problem here. It happens with
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:33.760]   large data aggregation. And we need to be thinking a lot more critically about Facebook. I got
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:41.120]   some things to say about them. I got some talking. So that is one thing that I've been told by
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.920]   security experts is if you don't see the data, for instance, from this first American title breach,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:50.800]   if you don't see it on the black market on the dark web, then it was almost certainly China.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:56.560]   Because that's what happened to the OPM data. That's what happened to the Anthem
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:02.400]   insurance data. It just disappeared. Like the data was exfiltrated, but disappeared. And the theory
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:09.040]   is the Chinese government is using it to track agents, to blackmail, to keep an eye on Chinese
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.480]   citizens abroad, that kind of thing. And so that's why they're breaking in. I would bet you the first
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.640]   American title. Actually, there's no breach there yet. They're just a flaw.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.480]   Yeah, we don't know any reporting on that. We don't know. Yeah, we'll keep an eye peeled.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:27.200]   Chinese students, as long as we're talking about China, and then we'll get to Huawei.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.920]   Oh, there's a lot to say there. There's a lot to say about Huawei. This is tragic.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:41.680]   Chiu-John Schuan, Chinese student leader of the Marxist Student Association of Payking,
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:52.720]   Chinese students apparently are making farewell messages, videos, among its crackdowns on labor
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:59.760]   activism. I could show you it's in Chinese, so it probably wouldn't communicate to most of us. But
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:06.320]   this is a way of saying, you know, he's saying I was interrogated, I was tortured.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:16.800]   It was done on campus. He says, if I disappear, it'll be because of the Chinese secret police,
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:24.480]   Beijing police. He disappeared April 29th. It's very reminiscent of Tiananmen Square. You have
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   happened when I was just a kid. It was all about people wanting to be able to express political
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   opinions more openly. And I think it's very notable, like China has actually, that's one of the most
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:42.400]   scrubbed incidents on the Chinese incident is Tiananmen Square. They just refer to it as the Tiananmen
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:50.240]   incident. It's very, very troubling. So I mentioned this only to underscore that the Chinese government
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:56.160]   has not a great history of human rights and so forth. So when we talk about Huawei, it's someone
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:03.520]   understandable that maybe, I mean, if the US government or the defense agencies have
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:10.800]   evidence that Huawei was co-opted by the Chinese government that they might become
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:18.000]   adversaries, whether it's industrial espionage or cyber warfare, that that would be reasonable to
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.720]   say we got to stop using Huawei stuff. And that's kind of what's happening. At this point,
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:31.280]   Huawei is persona non grata in a lot of ways. It started last week when President Trump signed
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:39.360]   an executive order banning the use of Huawei gear in the and actually what he banned was
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:45.360]   selling United States companies selling their gear to China to Huawei, which pretty much puts
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:51.280]   Huawei out of business shortly thereafter. Google said, okay, no Android license. They did
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.760]   subsequently say, well, we're going to give you 90 days and we're going to keep giving you patches,
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   but it doesn't I don't know if that 90 day. This is part of what's so confusing about this.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.480]   Is this back and forth thing? If I'm correct about this, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   it was the US Department of Commerce, and then they were added to the entities list. And the
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:16.320]   entities list is basically a list of companies. The American companies are forbidden to do business
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.760]   with unless they have a specific written exemption with that. Okay, you know, you know, the politics.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   I mean, the thing about the operating system is probably the least troubling things. They can
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.240]   replace the operating system. And more importantly, they can get access to because it's so much
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:35.920]   of it is open source. Arm licensing has apparently been shut down. So arm, the English company has
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:42.160]   said now we're going to withdraw license Qualcomm, which makes arm chips used by Huawei says we're
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.040]   not going to sell you anymore chips. Huawei makes its own Kirin processors, but those are arm chips.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:55.040]   Huawei can't use micro SD cards in its phone. Huawei can't buy gorilla glass from Corning
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:02.000]   while I mean, while I can't buy memory from micron. So the order which Trump signed Wednesday
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.120]   prohibits the purchase or use of any communications technology produced by entities controlled by
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   a foreign adversary, and likely to create undue risk of sabotage of US communication systems or
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.840]   catastrophic effects. So that means we can't buy their stuff. The Commerce Department now has
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.840]   150 days to produce rules that can identify particular countries or persons as foreign adversaries
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:30.240]   according to Politico. That's very likely to name China and Huawei or both, or either or both.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:37.200]   So Leah, I feel like I have a lot to say about this. Can I say one more thing? Then I'm going to
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:47.840]   give you a chance because the latest is interview with Donald Trump. This is awkward. This is
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:54.800]   Thursday afternoon. Remember Trump addressed the press and was asked about Huawei. This is what
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:56:00.240]   the president said. Huawei is something that's very dangerous. You look at what they've done from a
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:05.440]   security standpoint, from a military standpoint, it's very dangerous. So it's possible that Huawei
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:10.240]   even would be include. Wait a minute. Now this is where, okay, got it. They're very dangerous.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:15.520]   Then the next sentence is, so it's possible Huawei even would be included in some kind of a trade
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:22.080]   deal. If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei being possibly included in some form, some part
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:28.000]   of a trade deal. Reporter, how would that look? Trump, it would look very good for us.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.920]   Reporter, but the Huawei part, how would you design that? Oh, it's too early to say. We're just very
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.880]   concerned about Huawei from a security standpoint. So there's two different things he's saying here.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.480]   Right. One is they're dangerous. The other is, well, once we have a trade deal, they're not so
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.520]   dangerous. As if that will be included. So this is all along with my concern.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:53.280]   And then I'm, Brianna, I'm going to ask what you think. But all along my concern is it's unclear
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:58.160]   because we haven't been given evidence is we know Huawei's kind of a crappy company.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:02.800]   We've, Father Robert said, yeah, the Huawei guy was winding around the trade show,
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:08.160]   taking pictures of the competitor's stuff. They've been caught doing not such great stuff.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:14.240]   Yeah, not corporate espionage, not security stuff. I also, every day scumbag,
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:20.800]   normally many companies, one of the accusations is they flew tech reporters to Paris and London.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:26.560]   Well, every freaking company I've got offers every week go to, hey, I'd like to go to Compute
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:32.480]   Tech. All expenses paid. I mean, that's very common. So that, I don't know if that's,
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.400]   I mean, it's not good, but it's not national security bad.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:41.280]   Right. They haven't shown us national security evidence, but maybe they can't because that
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:46.720]   would reveal sources. So I understand it. So I think it's really important to go back in time
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:52.800]   here and kind of establish a timeline. Okay, good. So, you know, let's, let's think back with 2016
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:57.440]   and goose for 2.0, like basically penetrating the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:03.920]   And that was, we now know Russia, GRU. Exactly. Exactly. So information security on these devices.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:10.320]   This is a very legit concern. And I want, I want to tell you, Leo, I have gotten warnings
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:17.120]   to not use Huawei devices on my campaign to not let anyone from the Democratic National Committee
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:22.400]   as suggested by our intelligence agency. And the DNC is rightly a little jumpy about this.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.920]   There after, after 2016, it's a valid concern. So I want to, I want to preface my remarks by saying,
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:34.480]   infosec, like cybersecurity, this is 10 out of 10 importance, the right thing for us to be thinking
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:42.800]   about as a country. But what is the evidence so far that Huawei is spying on the United States?
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:48.880]   There's nothing, there's nothing in the public domain. There's not been any evidence shown to us
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.880]   or any kind of information security person that we can point to and say, this is an unusual threat.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:59:01.200]   The best thing that they've come up to show is basically different forks of Huawei software
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:06.080]   could potentially be, you know, code signed in a malicious way and weaponized against us.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.880]   Yes, stuff for the voter vote. It was the UK stuff.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:15.280]   You know, again, a valid concern with every single company that is like not doing cybersecurity
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:20.480]   correctly is going to end up on this entities list. Like this can be a lot of people out of
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:29.120]   business in the United States. Right, exactly. And I really want, I want you to think for a second,
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:35.440]   what happens if China does this back to us? What happens if China says, you know what,
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:42.320]   if you're a Chinese company, you can't do anything with Microsoft software or Google software,
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:49.920]   or they decide to throw Apple out of their country again. Like this really could be a digital cold
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.080]   water. But the fact that it could backfire guys, this shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:59.680]   Of course, it's the right problem and it's a wrong approach. What would you suggest?
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.920]   Well, Huawei, what they themselves have come forward and said is like, look, we understand
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:09.680]   you have concerns. We're willing to let you in show you our hardware, show you our software,
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.440]   allow code auditing, like process it. It's worth pointing out it's very hard to prove a negative.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.240]   It's very hard to prove that there's not a secret backdoor in hardware or software.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:26.320]   But it's a step in the right direction. So I think we should, if we have concerns about spying,
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:32.160]   I think we should bring them in, should try different solutions to verify that this is not
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:38.080]   being used maliciously against us. And then if we have to take it to DEF CON, DEF CON 4, we can.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:44.720]   But I don't think we're there yet. It is. This is the other price. This is so difficult because,
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.600]   and Trump just really confused it because if he said security, security, security,
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.920]   I'd feel more comfortable. But when he says security, security, but oh, if we make a trade deal,
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   never mind, that really sounds like it's a good possibility that this is purely political.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:07.600]   On the other hand, we've talked about this before. In fact, there's really no reason to
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.560]   allow Huawei or any Chinese networking gear in because most of that is software-driven and
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.800]   there's nothing to stop them. Maybe Huawei is completely pure as a driven snow right now.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.120]   Not a lot of evidence that they are, but let's say they are. There's nothing to stop the Chinese
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.040]   government in a month from saying, oh, by the way, here's some little code that you could insert into
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.640]   the switch. Would, you know, don't. Well, if you want to not disappear, use this. I mean,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.200]   there's also been a lot of anecdotal evidence that come out and that has come out. And one of
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.080]   the things that has come out in some cases is you will find that stuff that has been shipped
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:47.360]   from factory X, from company X, has been rerouted and things have been manipulated.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.680]   Editor box has been opened somewhere in between leaving the factory and hitting the
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.960]   plastic supply chain. Yeah. And it's interesting, right? Because there's a lot of
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.680]   places for the wheels to fall off. There's a lot of places for things to go wrong.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:08.000]   Code is incredibly complicated. Maintaining code is incredibly complicated. Like, oh, wait,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.400]   did we just forget to update the code? Or did we put the wrong code on that one? Because some
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.200]   technician was up for 22 hours trying to get everything packaged for the delivery and screwed
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.320]   up and saw the wrong software. It's really, really messy. Yeah. Imagine if someone got the
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.960]   code signing on and they passed an update to it with the backdoor. It's, but the solution here
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:35.760]   isn't to blacklist one company here. It's for us to have a really serious conversation as a nation
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:41.200]   about cybersecurity to work with other nations to develop a framework about this stuff.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.520]   And that way, it's not just American safe. It's people all over the world. This isn't just an
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:50.640]   American problem. This is a worldwide problem. Yeah. Can we blacklist five more companies?
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.600]   Well, this, yeah, by the way, the US apparently, according to Bloomberg, is considering blacklisting
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.680]   five Chinese video companies, none of which I'd ever heard of. Go to Amazon. Look for a cheap
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.200]   camera. Well, that's the thing is there's a lot of those cameras on Amazon.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.480]   Many of them may not be branded with those particular brand names. Here's a Russell
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:15.280]   Brandum writing on the Verge. It's a convincing case when it comes to restricting Huawei's role
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.720]   in network infrastructure, as I just said. And it's a case a number of officials have made in that
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:27.360]   context. But it makes a lot less sense for exported hardware. Why shouldn't Corning Glass or
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.880]   Micron Flash Memory be sold the Huawei for use in phones? They're not even bound for the US. They
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.440]   can't sell them. They don't sell them here. They're bound for Europe. So the infrastructure security
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:43.120]   argument makes no sense for those phones. And if the problem really is just that China has a
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.760]   history of intellectual property violations, which is what President Trump says, and trade
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.280]   secret theft, the same logic could easily apply to other Chinese companies like Lenovo and
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:59.520]   Drummaker DJI with catastrophic consequences for those companies in the industry at large.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:05.200]   Most of these companies make a lot of money on the West, particularly on the US.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:12.000]   We know ZTE is practically nonexistent after the similar restrictions last year.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.760]   I could imagine Huawei, even though they're pluckily saying, no, no, we can soldier on. We don't need
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.920]   Android. We don't need your stinking Corning Glass. We've been stockpiling parts for years. We can
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:32.560]   continue on. They have three months worth of parts, probably. To muddy the waters even further,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:39.760]   one of the arguments about this is, oh, the real challenge is that they're trying to clear
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:45.280]   the way for American companies or other companies to create basically all the 5G hardware that's
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:51.760]   going to run the network. They're clearing the path for other companies so that Huawei doesn't
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.480]   get all the business, despite the fact that Huawei's prices may actually be cheaper or their tools.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.640]   There's the other one that's like, oh, the American government is pissed because
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.840]   the Chinese government will have the back doors instead of the NSA having the back doors at the
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   switch level. I mean, the number of, because there's no hard information, the number of backstories
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:17.280]   and conspiracies on this, just every couple of weeks, somebody's got another theory.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.760]   Can I say something about that? It's utterly legit with 5G though. There's a philosophical
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:29.840]   difference that the Chinese government wants to embed certain kinds of technologies within the
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:35.920]   5G infrastructure code for the standard they are advocating that will allow them to basically
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:42.880]   back trace who says what to basically track where communications come from.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:50.000]   The American standard that we're pushing for is far more privacy oriented. So again, my solution
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.840]   to this is we've seen this in the EU, this danger of balkanizing. I'm laughing because I'm like,
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:03.520]   create the perfect device for ruling an authoritarian state and you'll be able to spy on everyone else
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:09.120]   in the world if your equipment is deployed. It's completely possible to me, in fact, seems likely.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.720]   There is a security threat. The Trump doesn't really understand that. He understands trade.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:21.280]   So he conflated the two and that if he would try to make the resuscitation of Huawei
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.640]   agenda with his trade agenda, that the infat intelligence agencies will say,
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:32.960]   no, no, Mr. President, you can't do that. So I guess we could take that part out of the equation.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.440]   Sure.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.280]   Here's what Bloomberg said, and this is actually scary. Bloomberg's headline
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.960]   is the tech cold war has begun. And this is how they wanted it. China now has no choice but to
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:52.480]   pursue technological independence and will burn the cash to achieve it. Stretecory Ben Thompson
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:58.320]   who lives in Taiwan and is very familiar with Chinese culture across the straits there,
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:06.720]   says this is something China has been preparing for. It is actually a very Chinese thing. This goes
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:14.160]   back to the Boxer Rebellion and China closing its doors to the West. Culturally, I think, and I
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:20.080]   may be a no expert, but culturally, I think there's a long history in China of rejecting the West
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.360]   and say, we are the middle kingdom. We're the center of the world. We don't need you.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:32.080]   And in fact, if they decided that, I think what would show up is maybe they don't need us,
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:38.160]   but we sure as hell need them. Well, that's a big problem. You were talking about before the show,
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:44.080]   rare earth materials. The rare earth is probably a big issue is like where all of our laptops
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:50.560]   going to be manufactured. And our smartphones. I mean, our game consoles and our televisions.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:58.560]   India, Brazil, South Korea, I mean, but it's a Samsung part of its, it's not as simple as just
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:05.120]   relocating a factory. There is a massive collection of businesses that all work together in that
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:11.520]   reason that give them at this current state some pretty significant advantages in terms of producing
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.680]   electronics in a timely and efficient fashion. Tim Culpin writing in Bloomberg says, even the
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.920]   briefest of bands will be proof to them that China can no longer rely on outsiders. We can now
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.000]   expect China to redouble efforts to roll out a homegrown smartphone operating system,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:32.240]   design its own chips, develop its own semiconductor technology, including design tools and manufacturing
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:37.840]   equipment and implement its own technology standards. This now they've got the resources to do that,
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.920]   whether they'll do it well, I don't know. But this can only accelerate, he writes the process
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:46.960]   of creating a digital iron curtain. Right. That separates the world into two distinct mutually
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.280]   exclusive technology spheres. That doesn't on the face of it seem like a very good thing.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.320]   It doesn't. We're seeing a balkanization of the internet. You policy?
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.880]   Splinter net. They call it. Splinter net. Yeah. I do want to just say,
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:07.120]   this is not my opinion. I'm just sharing my father-in-law's opinion, who is, you know,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:14.160]   he immigrated here from China. I would ask most Americans to take a breath and to realize many
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:20.080]   Chinese people feel an immense sense of pride with Huawei. It's the company that's kind of gone
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.240]   toe-to-toe with Apple. They do consider it a national treasure source.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.480]   Currently the number two phone manufacturer in the world.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:34.240]   Exactly. So, you know, again, my instinct here is we should be working with these people and
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.800]   trying not to balkanize the entire technology industry.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:48.480]   I think you can make a case that our national security is better served by
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.040]   free and open trade with an adversary than by closing the doors.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.600]   Entangled interests, absolutely. Exactly. As long as China has an economic interest in the
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.880]   United States, it's highly unlikely that they're going to attack us.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:07.280]   And so it worries me. It feels like the wrong direction.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:15.040]   And I don't want to underestimate the cyber security dangers Huawei presents to our network
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.640]   and our allies networks. But there's got to be a better way than closing the door entirely.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.480]   Absolutely. That doesn't seem like the best policy.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.240]   It's the right problem, but the wrong solution, basically.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:31.440]   And by the way, China's hackers are pretty good too.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:37.840]   So the other risk is that what we were talking about earlier is of an all-out cyber war.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:48.720]   I think you could make the case that the US in a traditional warfare would have a strong case.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.480]   But I don't know if we have the same advantage in a cyber warfare.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.480]   I don't know if that's if we do.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:03.120]   This was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. China is really, they're focusing their military
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.520]   currently on AI and machine learning and deep learning technology to basically have machines
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.600]   that spend all day every day trying to penetrate our systems here.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.120]   It's very William Gibson at this point.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:21.760]   It really is. It's terrifying. And to a certain point, I think my job, if I were fortunate enough
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.360]   to serve in Congress, would be to fund countermeasures for that.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.480]   But we need to not underestimate our enemy or potential enemy here.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:37.920]   It doesn't matter how many tanks, guns, planes, we have, if we can't like transport the fuel to
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.880]   fly them. It's not going to do any good if the grid shut down. Exactly.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.960]   Ben Thompson, good article as always from Stretecherie, final paragraph.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.200]   This is the true war when it comes to technology censorship versus openness,
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.840]   control versus creativity, and centralization versus competition.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.000]   These are, of course, connected. China's censorship is about control facilitated by centralization.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.120]   That though should not only give Western tech companies and investors pause about China generally,
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.200]   but it should also lead to serious introspection about the appropriate policies towards our own
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.560]   tech industry. Openness, creativity, and competition are just as related as their counterparts.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.240]   Infringement on any of them should be taken as a threat to all three. So it's an interesting take
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.760]   on all this, which is we should double as China doubles down on closing its doors,
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.680]   we should double down on opening our doors. Very interesting take from somebody who's very smart.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.400]   All right. Meanwhile, I sure want to get that playdate game machine.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.880]   That sounds cool. Yeah, I brought my old school 80s Game Boy on this trip. I should have brought
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:52.160]   it. We could play some Tetris. My husband. Do you enjoy it? My husband, he loves old tech games.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:58.320]   It's at a level where you feel in control of it. So we play a lot of Tetris from the 80s Game Boy.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.120]   You're in good company. I see if I can find this picture.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.960]   It's a good game. Oh, it's supposed to be very good. That's a depressing game because there are
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.840]   people. Yeah. Why is it depressing? Because there are people that have done nothing but play
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:19.280]   Tetris since the 80s and they will destroy you. I'm sorry, but that's true for me for every game.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:27.360]   If I'm going to worry about dangerous games, I get waxed minute I play any game.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:33.760]   Let me see if I can find this picture. Here it is. This is somebody you might recognize and his wife.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.800]   They too really enjoy their Game Boy. Sorry, it's a very large photo. I was taking a while to
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:45.280]   download it. Let me see if I can get it again. Oh, so big. Come on, baby.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:54.640]   It has a challenge of 35 megabits. Sometimes the internet is just so slow. One more time.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.400]   Well, I could just zoom in on the thumbnail. Zoom in on the thumbnail. Look at that.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.640]   Somebody you might know. I do. And by the way, notice they have the Game Boy interlink.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.760]   I love it. That's the key. They're playing head to head. Probably Tetris.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.840]   That's Steve Washington. One of the only people taking it off to get that running.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.040]   Isn't that awesome? I had to take that picture when I saw them in the lobby of the hotel.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.840]   This is fantastic. Cruise we took to a South American community.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.400]   Which Game Boy is that? That looks like the Game Boy color.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:27.040]   Oh, sure. It's the best money could buy. It wouldn't be because the Game Boy advances a better screen.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.160]   What about the 3D? Or VR? Game Boy VR, man.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:39.600]   Our show today brought to you by Cash Fly. Oh, man. I literally brought you by Cash Fly.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.040]   If you, when you go, people tell me this all the time, you know, I don't know what you guys
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.480]   are doing when I go to download the show, whether it's from your website or with my podcast application.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:54.240]   You know, it's always just comes right in fast. I never have a problem. There's never any
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:00.560]   hiccup or pause. That's Cash Fly, our CDN, our content delivery network. We've been on Cash Fly
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:07.520]   for 10 years now. When we first started to it, it's kind of funny. I mean, I grew a little faster
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:13.440]   than I anticipated. At first, I was just having them downloaded from my website, which immediately
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:18.160]   I ran out of bandwidth. So then I started using BitTorrent. I said, "Please, seat our show."
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:24.960]   And then other people will be able to get it. Thank God, Matt Levine at Cash Fly came over to me.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:31.760]   It's probably 2007 or 8. He said, "Leo, can we just... Let's fix this." And ever since, it's been a happy
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.200]   match. Twit and Cash Fly. We love Cash Fly. You will too. If you have to deliver content,
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:46.560]   software, a web app to your customers, power it with the Cash Fly CDN, you will be 30% faster
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:51.600]   than the competition. Cash Fly delivers rich media content up to 10 times faster than the
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:56.240]   traditional delivery methods. It does that by having servers all over the world close to where
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.920]   your customers are, but it's also 30% faster than other major CDNs. And because they have servers
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.920]   all over the world, they can give you a 100% SLA. I'm not talking for 4-9s, 5. I'm talking 100%.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:13.040]   Cash Fly guarantees the best user experience for all your customers, no matter where they are,
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:19.760]   what device they're on. LG, Microsoft, Adobe, R's, Technica, and Twit. We all use Cash Fly's
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.360]   reliable network. I love Cash Fly. I've never gotten that call three in the morning.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:32.560]   CDNs down. Never. The other thing that's great about billing, Cash Fly will work with you because
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:38.800]   they know a lot of bandwidth usage is spiky, right? We get lots of downloads Sunday night and it
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.600]   slows down through the week. Cash Fly will work with you to get a custom plan tailored to your needs
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.440]   based on your yearly usage trends. So you know what you're going to pay. You want to find out how
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.760]   much you can save. Go to twit.cashfly.com and you'll get a free, completely detailed analysis of your
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:02.800]   current CDN billing usage trends, no sales pitch, just straight facts. So you'll know if Cash Fly
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:09.840]   can save you as much as 20% on your CDN or more, twit.cashfly.com. We love them and we're so glad that they
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:16.720]   help us out and I think you should try them too. They could help you out. twit.cashfly.com.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.320]   Let's find something fun.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:28.080]   No, that was a heavy topic. Oh my gosh. Panasonic by the way is also suspending transactions
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.880]   for the Huawei. That means no batteries. That's where they get their batteries.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:36.960]   No. I just, I feel like this, they're going to, we're going to put this company out of business
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:44.160]   and it's going to happen fast and it might be something we regret. By the way, I love the Huawei
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:52.240]   P20 and the new, what is it? P30 is amazing. Both the ROTs, images are fantastic. I've always wanted
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.480]   that made book. That's, you played with that. Oh, it's great. Yeah. Yeah. It's better than a
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.360]   MacBook. Christina raves about it. Yeah. Oh yeah, that's right. You work with that Christina.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:09.360]   Christina Warren. She's dangerous. It's a good podcast, by the way. If you're looking for more
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.800]   podcasts to listen to, you're still doing it during the campaign? Yeah. I love, I love Christina and
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.080]   Simone so much that even if I was elected, I would not quit rocket. We would find a way to
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:26.320]   do it every week. Really? Yeah. Well, I couldn't accept any sponsor money at that point legally,
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.960]   but you'd have to like when the ad comes along. Well, you'll let Simone do it anyway.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.040]   We do. When the ad comes along, you'd have to just leave the room. I would do that and just give
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.640]   Simone and Christina. I don't know what's going to happen next, but I'm not going to be here.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:44.720]   I guess more about not accepting the money. Yeah. That's a couple of years ago. I'm sure
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:51.200]   Mike and people had to keep your share. I mean, think about like a podcast from Congress every
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:56.000]   week talking at the tech policy going on. That would be a good show. We have gone back and forth
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.920]   Lisa and I about saying, can you do that show for us, please? No, no, no. I'm envisioning certain,
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.400]   I'm taking certain quotes I've heard from various congress critters and senators and things like,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:12.080]   yes, that would be an interesting. It'll be me and Marsha Blackburn on the show. It'll be great.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.560]   That would be great. No, we've talked a lot about doing a tech and politics show. I think that
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:22.240]   it does, yeah. Unfortunately, angering everyone, the new tech and politics phone with network.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:28.080]   But well, this is a problem for us because when we first started when Patrick and I were working
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:34.640]   together 20 years ago was computers, maybe a little internet thrown in. There were political
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.360]   discussions at times. But technology is now in every facet of our lives,
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.440]   every single, it's everywhere. There's really no more a distinction between, well, this is a
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.880]   tech subject and this is something else. It's all mushed together. So it's very, it's challenging.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:54.800]   I mean, I wish I would be so happy to be sitting here talking about, you know, those new Intel
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.840]   i9 processors, eight cores at five gigahertz. What do you think, Patrick? I think I want to actually
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:05.120]   test one and see if it works out in real life. But no, I mean, it was funny though, because
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:09.840]   they had a conversation with a relative and they were just like, oh, net neutrality is bad.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.640]   And I'm just like, neutrality. Oh goodness. Bad. Where did they get that? Well, that's the
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:20.880]   problem. I had somebody call me up on the radio show exactly that. It's bad. I said, why is it bad?
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.680]   Because I don't want the government making any regulations. I said, sir, do you wear a seatbelt?
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.960]   Sir, do you drive on the highway, sir? Do you trust the drinking water coming out of your tap?
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.680]   Well, yeah. Well, gosh darn it. That's called a government regulation. Sir,
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:41.280]   when you walk out of your house, do you fear? Do you worry that somebody might come up and hit you
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.560]   in the back of the head? Well, no. Well, that's called laws. That's what makes this. We're a nation
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:56.240]   of laws. It's okay to make a law. Okay. I agree. Meanwhile, Intel just announced
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:01.760]   nine, nine, nine processors. So Intel traditionally, historically, has been unable
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:07.680]   to cross four gigahertz. They can't get below 10 nanometers. They can't. So I think they've
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:11.920]   given up on the 10 nanometers, honestly, they say they're going to do them, but they haven't.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.360]   Well, they're trying. No one's, no one's denying they're trying.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:22.480]   You've got companies like TSMC making seven nanometer processors, but anyway, okay, I'm just
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:29.120]   saying, but Intel has apparently been able to crack the four gigahertz barrier. They are now.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:38.320]   This is an I-9, the 9900KS, eight cores, all of which can run at five gigahertz all the time.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.560]   Well, I mean, and this is actually a big deal because, you know, you always see it's running
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.000]   at like 1.3 gigahertz and 2.7 gigahertz in turbo modes. Speed step or whatever. Yeah.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.240]   But it's like basically, okay, for one brief moment, your processor will shoot up to this fast,
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.480]   one will one core of your processor. And then thermals will shut it down immediately.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.640]   Yeah, exactly. Like it basically makes something move a little faster than mine. Otherwise,
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.360]   you know, if this is, I mean, this is directly,
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:11.840]   this would be very exciting if it's true. Yeah. And I want to see, I want to see benchmarks
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.200]   on these. I want to see benchmarks on these cars of the rise. I want to see the rise in three,
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.240]   right? Which is going to be coming out. Yeah, which is going to be coming out like, you know,
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.360]   seven, seven, seven nanometers, seven. We've got the AMD Intel competition is bad.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.080]   Oh, yeah. Well, it's more because Intel stumbled.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:32.240]   Because AMD is so great. Maybe yes, no. AMD is doing some extraordinary things right now.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:38.240]   Don't take any credit away from Dr. Sue and the team at AMD. They're doing some badass engineering.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:43.760]   They're also doing some badass pricing. And yes, Intel left a badass door the size of a house
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:48.720]   for them to drive through. You know, Intel for a long time was like, you know,
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.200]   Ryan and I used to talk about this before he went to go work at Intel.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:57.520]   About how Intel. What are you talking about, Patrick? I don't know anything.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:04.320]   You know, the, the, and DAs are fine. And, but the, but what we were talking about is,
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:09.440]   is that Intel didn't really care about PC users. They didn't really care about PC power users,
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.600]   especially. What was their market? Well, the majority of us know what I mean,
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.000]   so they make a ton of money in a lot of places. We don't want to get that granular, right? But
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   in terms of, in terms of, I know. Yeah. Well, so what happened, right? Is,
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.960]   is, you know, Intel, much like Microsoft never really made it in handhelds and mobile. And that
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:33.440]   was a huge problem because the vast majority of the planet is going to interface with the internet
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:38.160]   and computers in the form of a phone. That said, you know, and then they, well, okay, so we're
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:41.600]   going to do, we're going to do Raspberry Pi competitive. Well, that didn't seem to work out.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.920]   We're going to, okay, we have this amazing, that the Edison, right? Yeah, they killed a lot of stuff.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.720]   And they went back like, Oh, you know, we can make really fast processors for enthusiasts and
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.200]   professionals. But the majority of the market though is actually laptops, you know, and, and
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:00.160]   what's in a certain price. I love my MacBook Air, which is running a U processor is slow, but
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:06.560]   it doesn't seem slow. I have a, I have the $5,000 iMac Pro. My desktop, I don't go running in there
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:10.640]   when I want to do something. Yeah. Because I have my nice thin light, Macbook Air. I'm very happy.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.640]   When I'm browsing the web, a laptop is what we do 90% of what we do. It doesn't need fast anything
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:22.640]   fast. Then we get a little messy when you get into, you know, photography video, rendering gaming.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:28.080]   Yeah. I have a confession. When I do call time, I have final fantasy 14 opened up on my Mac.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:34.160]   Don't say this. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. No. It's like you're doing video. You're doing
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.200]   crafting. Where's your campaign manager? I do keep that open on my Mac. It's going.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.680]   We should explain call time is something that is the great shame of the United States.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.640]   Oh, it's horrible. It's horrible. Which is that most significant percentage of the time that
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.400]   anybody elected in an elected office, at least at the federal level, spends calling donors asking
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.720]   for money. Right. Shaken the money tree. Oh, it's true. It's called call time. It's called call time.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.000]   Gotta be the most miserable time of your, how much time do you have to spend? Oh, I actually love
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.040]   it. I love it. I'm going to love it. But there is a lot of downtime between each call. So that's where
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.120]   it's held. Right. That's where I'm doing that. But my point with this is, you know, I just love
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:20.400]   that vision of you. It's like, well, it's your crafting and final fantasy 14. We've got, we've got,
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.600]   I don't know who we got. We've got the the Koch brothers on line three. Hold on.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.040]   Okay. The Koch brothers are on line three. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:35.120]   almost there. The Koch brothers on line three. I'll just screw it. I'm busy. So we would say that.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:41.280]   My point is though, I am interested. George Soros on line four. I would pick up the call.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:47.680]   My point is, I do think that there is a, I personally have a need for better
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:55.280]   processors in my Macbooks. But the fact that Apple is really handicapped, the processor
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.280]   architecture with the thermal design. I don't think it's Apple's fault. In fact, Apple,
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.080]   at their quarterly call said we would have made more. We would have sold more. But we
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.240]   couldn't get the parts. They didn't name Intel, but they knew, but everybody knew. This is Apple
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:13.520]   effectively spanking Intel because Intel is not Apple that could have given a rat's
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.840]   ass about the computer lines for what better part of a decade because most of their money came from
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.360]   iPhones. Yeah, but I'm not sure that I think Apple would have liked to have done better and more
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:31.120]   because they, Mac is important to them both internally because everybody uses a Mac at Apple.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.320]   But also to developers, you can't, you don't get any Mac OS or iOS software if developers don't
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:44.960]   have Macs. I have literally melted two MacBook Pros running Maya, which is a very heavy 3D program
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:50.080]   on a MacBook Pro because the thermals are so bad and the heat eventually caused the logic board to
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:57.520]   fail. But it's silent. Right, exactly. So, you know, when they're talking about the new Intel's
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:03.600]   in the new 15-inch that they just launched, I'm like, I have to, mentally, I'm like, what's the
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:09.040]   freaking point? I had my finger poised over the buy button until I looked over to the right and
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:18.160]   I said $5,000. And I went, whoa. And honestly, I'm buying Windows PCs because I can't bring myself
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:23.200]   to buy. I can't use these keyboards. I can't bring myself to buy what Apple's making. I just bought
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:29.840]   a ThinkPad X1 Xtreme, which I'm very happy with. And I just put Linux on it. Yeah. Because I,
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.080]   I'm not crazy about Windows either, but Linux is pretty damn good these days. Yeah. And it's amazing
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.400]   because we've installed that Linux, you know, Shannon's installed Linux on a bunch of laptops
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.800]   in the past few months. And it's amazing how, you know, it used to be like, I'm going to install,
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.320]   yeah. It's a very complete experience. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's a real desktop operating system.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.920]   Lately, I've been using pop-o-less support for, you know, I mean, it's not like you're like, oh,
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:54.160]   I can't use. I mean, video support's all this weird, non-free stuff. I've been using pop-o-less,
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.640]   which is system 76's spin on Ubuntu, which is a spin on Debian. I'm not, I don't like that
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:07.840]   aesthetically, but it installs everywhere. It runs very well on everything. And suddenly, you know,
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:12.720]   and, and, and there's analogs for everything. And if you want to use Microsoft Office,
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.680]   they have a very credible web app that runs just fine. All the office apps runs just fine on the
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.160]   web where you can use wine if you want, if you really need it, or you can use Libra Office.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.320]   There's plenty, I'm using dark table and raw therapy instead of Photoshop and Lightroom.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.360]   Really? Yes. Actually, raw therapy is very good. I would recommend it. I'll give it a go. I don't
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.840]   want to give Adobe anymore. Am I, I was terrible ever since they moved to cloud computing.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:41.840]   It's done. Well, the cloud, creative cloud service. Yeah. I do keep windows running on that thinkpad
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:47.680]   in a small partition because there's a few windows apps, you know, mostly it's petro's 99.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:54.640]   Yeah. There we go. So this I 99900KS, we don't know what the TDP will be.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:02.560]   It's going to be more than 95 watts, I'm thinking. I don't know how much more. A 910% maybe.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:08.560]   All right. Not even, not even 150 watts. Well, but we've also seen a lot of TDPs where when you
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:13.680]   actually flat everything out, the actual power consumption is considerably higher than the TDP.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:19.200]   Light up Manhattan with the power. Not quite, but certainly a room. Intel has kind of
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.720]   muddy the water a little bit from last year's Compute Text. By the way, Compute Text is coming
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:29.680]   up. That's why this conversation is going to, they, they kind of pretended that they were running a
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:37.360]   28-core Xeon CPU at 5 GHz, but they were using a lot of cooling that subzero chiller.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:44.560]   And maybe there was, there wasn't even all of the information like overclocking.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:50.000]   Yeah. The other thing that gives me a pause, but Intel is, you know, after Spectra Meltdown came out,
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.040]   basically, you know, vulnerabilities in the Intel processor was speculative execution.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:01.040]   And we, we got a whole new, basically list of vulnerabilities that came out.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:04.640]   Yeah. Zombie land. The new one is zombie land. We're really surprised.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:07.520]   We were talking about zombie load. Zombie land is a great movie.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:12.000]   Don't feel bad. I did the same thing in the title three times.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.960]   Not to be confused with the movie, zombie land. No zombie load. And it takes a
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:20.240]   bunch of speculative execution. And the real problem is that when you turn off
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:25.840]   speculative execution or you somehow mitigate these threats, you cut performance by, in most
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:32.000]   cases, significant, more than noticeable amount. Isn't it just in like cloud computing applications?
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.320]   That's where it's a problem. Steve gives in on security now, and I'm sure you say the same thing,
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:41.040]   Patrick, says, "End users don't really need to worry about it. We haven't seen any exploits in the
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:48.800]   wild. If you're running a server, multiple users on one processor, absolutely, because any one of
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:54.880]   those processes could be malicious. But it's hard to get a malicious process on my computer at home.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:31:00.400]   That could then get the right chunks of data in me. Sounds like a challenge for someone else.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:07.040]   I may be wrong, but I don't think there are any exploits in the wild. It was discovered.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:13.440]   It was patched, and then it was announced. But we've seen numbers anywhere from three to nine
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:19.200]   percent for typical home users scenarios with a patch to as much as 40%. A lot of the numbers
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:24.720]   you heard were for the latest generation and the latest model processors. That's scary. But then
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.640]   as they get older, it tends to have a more dramatic impact on performance.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:35.760]   And I asked Steve this, and he thinks it's possible, I'm not sure it's possible to mitigate in a newer
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:41.840]   design without turning off speculative execution. He says you can, and I don't know enough about
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:48.880]   processor design, but he says that the flaw is this leakage of information between processes.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.560]   And he says it's completely possible to still have speculative execution,
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.640]   but to have policies in place that keep information from going to it.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:00.720]   I feel comfortable in saying a lot of people that are much smarter than I will ever be
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:04.960]   are working furiously at that problem with staggering amounts of money behind them right now.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.840]   Yes. Isn't the problem with the ring states for the processor and not the speculative
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:15.200]   Oh, interesting. So the leakage, I don't know where the leakage occurs.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.400]   And then it's, I mean, hackers are good these days. I mean, things like, and by the way,
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:24.320]   these are mostly white hat hackers because the black hats are just using scripts, but the
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:28.960]   white hat hackers, the people like Tavis Armand, they seem to be able to be using fuzzing and
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:34.640]   all sorts of interesting techniques. The timing techniques are the ones that amaze me.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:40.400]   Yeah, I'm not even I've I it's hard. It's hard to believe it even works, but it does.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:46.960]   Okay, so see, I got a little processor talk in there. It's processed. There was leaks of new AMD
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.320]   GPUs in advance of architects. Yes. That's of AMD.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.520]   Yes. You know, the company. Why don't we do a little Computex preview, Patrick Norton?
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:57.280]   Well, that's the big thing I'm excited about is essentially like the 3080 and 3070,
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:02.320]   which are comparable to a 2060 and a 2070 in performance, but for about a hundred bucks less.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:08.560]   And no, as far as we know, there will be no RTX support, which I don't particularly mind because
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:14.960]   there's only like five RTX games and we're RTX is this ray tracing technology that's in both,
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.280]   I think, and the ray tracing technology that looks amazing in technology announcements,
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.960]   but in real world games at this point is not a huge difference.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.720]   Which, oh really? So even the games that are using it, you don't see it.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.480]   It's early days, man. I saw that.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:34.800]   Relaysings. Was it doom? The demo where they used ray tracing and it was pretty good looking.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.400]   I was doom. It was pretty 80.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.960]   Yeah. I'll show you. What makes sense? Carmack is like, well, at least his legacy is on that team.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.840]   No, he's not. Yeah. He's more quick. It was quick.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.920]   Quake 2 real time ray tracing. This is using RTX 2.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.520]   And I don't know if this is before or after, but the lighting effects.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.880]   This is after. This is the after. Oh, look at that. Yeah.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.720]   Yeah. So the textures aren't going to get much better, but look at the lighting effects.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:06.080]   And then things like, I'll scroll ahead a little bit. Things like the light coming in through windows,
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.000]   which is the kind of thing you'd expect ray tracing to.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.280]   So have they released the open source version of this yet? I don't know.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:16.080]   Have they? Well, this is like a project from NVIDIA.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.880]   Yeah. Well, it's a proof of concept, Patrick.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   I'm down with proofs of concepts, but making a really old game look better
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:28.160]   using a technology that requires an expensive GPU is not as impressive to me as making a
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.840]   contemporary game look better on your expensive new GPU.
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:37.440]   Okay. I have to tell you, like, as a 3D professional and a little expert,
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:41.120]   I don't see anything there you couldn't fake with other memes.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:47.040]   I'm ashamed to admit I let our 16 year old buy and play Mortal Kombat 11.
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.920]   Oh, gosh. Wow. I'll walk by everyone.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.120]   I go, oh, but oh my God.
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.400]   But just a spine. He's playing it on the switch.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.080]   Yeah. And I and it's all trickery, I understand, but it looks like.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:04.480]   Amazing. They did a good retopology pass on it. It looks pretty good.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:07.440]   It's amazing. Yeah. But it's also a lot of what our takes.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.640]   One is so realistic.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.360]   By the way, did you see the story that and it was an anonymous developer
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:21.760]   at Mortal Kombat who was suffering from PTSD because in order to model the blood splatters
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:26.160]   and what it looks like when a spine is ripped from a body, they actually have
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:33.360]   images, real images to work off of. And the guy said after months working on this,
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.200]   I can't sleep. I can't, I have PTSD.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:42.000]   I don't doubt that. I'm just trying to figure out where exactly you find the images of spinal
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.520]   columns being. Oh, if you ever talk to an animator, they have the weirdest photo folder you will
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:51.920]   ever see in your life. It's like fortune, but on your next door neighbors. It's really.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:59.760]   I got PTSD just walking through the room. It is. I saw a, what do they call that final?
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.960]   School, huh? Nothing you wouldn't see at med school. Yeah. If you can't stand the heat,
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.560]   get out of the kitchen. I mean, generally in med school, they're dead on a table and you cut
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:13.040]   them open with a big anatomy book. It's a little different from actually watching.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:17.520]   I think there is a kill move that like that actually. I've seen them all.
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:24.560]   I saw one. Oh my God. I'm watching this stuff. This guy's 16. I can only think this is going to,
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:30.240]   but no PTSD is a very sweet innocent. It's a game. He understands. I don't.
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:36.160]   There was a move. One of the guys, he has a chain and he gets it in the person's mouth.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:47.520]   And he basically tears their head off. Ew. Ew. GD. Let's talk government.
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:53.440]   Okay. Because you want to be in government. I do. You crazy person. GDPR.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.320]   Now, I looked and looked for conflicts of interest from this site because I'm not familiar with it.
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:09.120]   TruthOnTheMarket.com. I think this is actually a fairly balanced summary by Alex Step of GDPR
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:17.280]   after one year because it was exactly a year ago. The fines, $55 million, most of that for Google,
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:27.600]   cases, 281,000 cases, 37% are ongoing. Only 0.1% appealed. Now, here's the unintended consequences.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:34.560]   Some of these I agree with some of the I don't. Article 15, right of access. You can access the
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:41.440]   data the company keeps. Unfortunately, sometimes the data goes awry. Amazon accidentally set 1700
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:48.080]   Alexa voice recordings to the wrong user following a data request. This one I've got to read more
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:52.880]   about. This is from Jean Yang. I don't know if this is true. Jean writes, "Today, I discovered an
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.360]   unfortunate consequence of GDPR. When someone hacks into your account, they can request and
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:04.320]   potentially access all your data." Yes. If I sit down at your machine and you've left it open,
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:10.080]   I can pretend I'm Leo and companies don't know any different.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.520]   She says, "Whoever hacked into my Spotify account got all my streaming song history
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.920]   by requesting it." Oh, yeah, because they're you. I get it. That's not GDPR.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:26.480]   But it is because GDPR forces them to give you that information. In the case of the Amazon story,
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.920]   somebody's like, "I'm going to find out what Amazon's keeping on me." They got this giant
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:35.520]   collection of 1700 clips. Somebody else. This is not me. It doesn't even sound like me.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:40.320]   Who's that in my house? These things happen. He's always in my house.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:48.320]   I think it would be very hard to find anyone familiar with GDPR that wouldn't say,
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:55.200]   this is a well-intended law with a bad execution for it because the companies that they're trying to
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:01.120]   basically limit what they can do, they're able to get around it very easily. It's closed down,
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:08.000]   it affected a lot of small businesses. That is a real issue. They talk about the
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   compliance costs. Astronomical. For companies with more than 500 employees, it could reach $150
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.840]   billion. It's an aggregate. 75,000 data protection officers will have to be hired.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.680]   That's one of the requirements. This is a telling one. Microsoft has 1600 engineers working on
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:32.640]   compliance. That's 1600 people who have jobs, but they wouldn't be doing it if it weren't for GDPR.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:39.760]   What we have to also wonder is how many businesses have just shuttered because they can't do it.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:46.000]   We also went up. Microsoft has 135,000 employees. Yes. Good point. They do this for a living.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:55.280]   Here's the more subtle issue is that a big company can do it. A big company is going to be
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:03.200]   fine. It inadvertently locks in monopolies. I was more worried about what we would have to do
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:08.240]   for GDPR. I was nervous that we, in fact, after this new copyright law, I'm worried that we would
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:14.640]   have to block European listeners because, frankly, the entire show is us commentating on other people's
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:20.960]   stuff, including this. Under the new copyright law, that might be something we are no longer
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:28.640]   allowed to do. There's no fair use commentary. Oh, this is good. There's Poland. Poland has now
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:35.360]   filed a complaint against the copyright directive. Good luck, Poland. We're rooting for you.
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.640]   God bless you, Poland. I'm trying to see what they don't like. They've challenged it, saying the
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:47.440]   legislation would bring, "Oh, they're right. Unwanted censorship." They filed a complaint with a
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:52.800]   court of justice. I guess one thing you could say about GDPR is its well-intentioned. Maybe over time
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:59.120]   it will be the edges will be sanded off. It'll get better. You don't know what the consequences are
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:05.520]   until you try it. Look, this is something you, Leah, have thought about this so much. How,
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.680]   when you're saying tech policy with government, I think everyone in this room would probably agree.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:15.520]   We don't want Congress setting the standards with that. But it's not Congress, too.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:24.400]   Maybe the answer is for certain things you bring in the certification board. USB is the standard.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.120]   This worked pretty well. Maybe the answer is to empower more standards boards.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:35.120]   The civil process holds people to comply with it. Has said something like this? He said,
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:41.200]   "There should be courts for these specific issues, like especially dedicated courts to adjudicate this."
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.920]   Does it make a lot of sense? Yeah. You have this in biotech, so it makes a lot of sense to me.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.080]   It's a private state court. Oh, I'd love to see that.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.120]   I think part of it is a problem is some of these companies are so large and the problems are
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:56.400]   scaling so large is you cannot really have enough judges to deal with, say, Facebook and privacy,
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:00.560]   or Google and privacy. Well, that's why I'd be almost a separate, entirely separate court
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.160]   with separate judges. No, I mean that you'd still need a big court.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:11.040]   Do you want to talk about this is a big one? I don't know if we're going to have time.
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:17.040]   Julian Assange. So this is a challenging one because no one likes Julian Assange.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:23.600]   And apparently he considers himself a Christ-like figure. This is the picture of him being dragged
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:29.760]   away from the Ecuadorian embassy for, among other things, letting his cat poop all over the place.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.280]   Do we find out if this cat is okay? That's very important to me.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:42.720]   I'll check. The issue is now the US government is going to indict on under the Espionage Act.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:51.360]   And whether you like Julian Assange or not, and honestly, early on, I was rooting for him. When
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:59.200]   WikiLeaks released the drone strikes that killed journalists and innocent civilians,
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:06.480]   that was an eye-opener. And I think they did a service. He's being indicted now though.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.480]   And the original charges from the US government were for helping Chelsea Manning
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:19.200]   or not even helping offering in a chat to help Chelsea Manning hack the Defense Department.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:25.840]   The new charges are an expanded indictment obtained by the Trump administration
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:35.360]   that the Espionage Act is extremely broad. 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:40.640]   And this is where it's problematic for obtaining and publishing secret military and diplomatic
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:48.000]   documents in 2010. That is, by the way, something journalists do all the time.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.760]   Of course. Pentagon papers.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:53.120]   It was just, Danielle Ellsberg has done some pretty interesting interviews on this,
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:58.960]   where he basically says, "This is bad." Obama's administration declined to do this. They
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.720]   loved the thought about it. They wanted to. They hate him. But they said, "You know what?
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.360]   The risk to the First Amendment is too great. We can't do it."
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:13.040]   I mean, in my opinion, if you want to bring a case against Assange, if you have evidence that he
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:18.800]   or people in his employ were directly responsible for hacking attempts in the United States,
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:24.480]   that is more valid to me. But like it or not, WikiLeaks is a publisher.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:32.960]   And this is an attack on the First Amendment. So I think there is a case to be found here that I
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.960]   could feel good about. This is not it.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:41.200]   Janneel Jaffar of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University says this is the New
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:47.120]   York Times. "The charges rely almost entirely on conduct that investigative journalists engage
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:52.560]   in every day. This indictment should be understood as a frontal attack on press freedom."
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:45:00.400]   No, governments don't like leakers. And I understand why. But the First Amendment protects
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:07.200]   journalists who publish those leaks. And Bioso, the Obama administration was as hard or harder.
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:11.920]   Absolutely. Then almost anybody we've seen in decades on whistleblowers and leakers.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:18.320]   But even they declined to go this far. It's interesting. There's a great film that came out
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:24.080]   last year, The Post, which is about the Washington Post, and the publisher and the editor and the
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:28.480]   reporters and the story and the court case. And it's really interesting when you look at this,
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:35.200]   because there's a great moment with the lawyer shows up for The Post and he looks like he's 12.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:43.360]   In a sort of shiny, all-American kind of Midwestern way. And the editor for The Post is kind of like,
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:49.920]   "Here are counsel." But he's dealing with these arguments like, "Well, the Washington Post
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.960]   had published details of the D-Day invasion on the day before the advance." He's like,
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:57.200]   "We're talking about a historical survey and looking at information going back decades."
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:05.600]   And it was horrifying. When you start looking at what the Pentagon Papers leaked,
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:12.320]   you start realizing that everybody knew everything was screwed over there. And then tens of thousands
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:17.680]   of more people died. Because there was no-- Could make the argument that the Pentagon Papers
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:23.760]   saved lives by-- Absolutely. --bringing a quick end to the war. Or at least a change in the American
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:31.760]   attitudes towards the war. I mean, there are-- I'm very sympathetic to the military in particular
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:36.320]   when to safeguard that information. Leo, earlier in the show, you mentioned that we don't want to
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:42.400]   compromise sources and methods by our intelligence agencies. That is utterly valid. But these things
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:48.480]   are a balance. And this is just a very extreme act. We'll watch this with interest. One of the
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:53.760]   reasons the Obama administration did not pursue it is they were concerned about being overturned
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:47:02.800]   by the Supreme Court, because of the First Amendment. So obviously, if this prosecution goes forward,
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:08.240]   first he's going to have to be extradited. I wonder because the British law prohibits extradition
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:17.840]   if additional charges are filed. In other words, the US could extradite based on the initial charge.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:22.720]   But if they start to pile on charges, apparently, I read British law says, "Yeah, well, we're not
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:31.200]   going to extradite him then." So this may affect that as well. Of course, Assange's lawyers say
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:36.160]   that he's being charged with a crime for encouraging sources to provide him truthful information
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:43.280]   and publishing that information. And so any fig leaf that this was about hacking is now gone.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.440]   This is going to get really awkward. Yeah. Yeah. And it's going to go on for a while.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.960]   It's going to be terrible having to defend this guy because he's so bad.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:55.760]   As long as he doesn't bring his cat to court, I think we'll be okay.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.360]   Boy, there's so much more. We're just running short on time here.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.520]   Which we ended up, is there a positive note to end?
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.760]   Oh, yeah. The World Health Organization has said that the gaming disorder is a recognized
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.120]   illness. I'm looking for waters being squirrels here.
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:15.360]   Did you see the, I really thought this was interesting. Oh, this is so interesting.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.160]   This is now using these AI networks and generative adversarial networks are
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:26.800]   going to be a good game. And with, so in the past, we've seen, of course, deep fakes and the ability
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.240]   to take a picture of somebody and make it look like they're doing something else.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:37.280]   But this research is very interesting. It's from Samsung taking a single still image.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:46.160]   I'll turn off this bad Samsung music, taking a single still image and using another image
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:50.080]   to actually make the, for instance, the Mona Lisa talk. Let me see if I can.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:54.080]   The best one. Wasn't that amazing? Let me see if I can.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.720]   And I don't know if I find this comforting or relaxing.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:00.000]   We know it's coming. Okay. You don't like this one either.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.400]   No, no, no. I still was either full of terrible things.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:06.400]   From a technology perspective, it's deeply fascinating. But it's also,
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:13.040]   you know, in the context of what's going on in terms of elections and also, I mean,
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:18.560]   just the pure teenage misapplication possibilities for this is awe inspiring.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.280]   Facebook scrambles for middle gr- Oh, yeah. What about that?
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:26.160]   The, I mean, this is not an AI and I know all you had to do is take a video of Nancy Pelosi,
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:31.920]   slow it down 50%. She sounds drunken and swearing. But you could do that with me too.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:35.360]   Maybe they can fix the sonic movie with this.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.200]   There you go. There's a story we were looking for coming up.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:46.160]   The sonic movie, what, what weird devilish mischief is afoot.
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:49.600]   That's coming up at first a word from Kefterra.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:54.640]   Kefterra is the way to find business software. How many people, I gosh,
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:58.640]   this is a story of my life. I'd go to a new company and we're going to a radio station in San
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:04.400]   Francisco. This is in 1984. I was the new music director and they said, yeah, we generate our
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:13.360]   playlists for our DJs using this PDP 10 or 11 with a giant eight inch floppy. And they said,
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.400]   here, you just put the floppy in, you close the door. The head on the drive would go,
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:24.400]   conch. I mean, loud, and then it had a teletype, one of those old dot matrix things.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:31.440]   And put out a playlist. For some reason, within a few days, that eight inch floppy stopped working.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:37.200]   I don't know what happened. And we bought a PC. Thank you very much. Business software is
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:44.240]   notoriously bad. Truth. Are you running Windows XP, IE eight, so that you can run that very
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:51.600]   important line of business software that some, you know, the bosses, nephews, neighbor, wrote
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:55.520]   when he was in high school, but now he's left and he we haven't seen him in 20 years, but the
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:01.920]   software, that's all we got. Kefterra. There is great business software out there for every
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:08.880]   possible business. CRM. We're actually looking right now using Kefterra at new CRM solutions.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:16.400]   IT project management, e-commerce link management tools, web conferencing, or yoga studio management
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:24.720]   or veterinary business management. There are 900,000 reviews on here, 700 categories,
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.560]   thousands of products. And the best thing is you can filter it down. You pick the category,
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:33.200]   filter it down, say, I want only the best reviews. It's got to be a web application or a local
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:37.520]   application. I want it to be able to take care of this many customers. Whatever it is that you need,
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:43.280]   filter the results, compare them side by side up to four at a time. They'll even show you a list of
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:49.520]   related categories for further options. And then read the reviews. There are there are a thousand
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:55.840]   new reviews every single day by verified users. Kefterra is great about making sure those reviews
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:52:00.400]   come for people actually using the software. So you can actually find a program for you
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:07.280]   that and read the reviews and know it's right. No more Google search, no more calling Joe

[01:52:54.400 --> 01:53:02.000]   Maybe they should use some of this GAN AI on Sonic the Hedgehog.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:10.960]   So what was it? Was it a tweet? How did we see this image of Sonic? It was ugly as sin, right?
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:15.760]   That's from the trailer. Yeah. Was it from the trailer? Yeah. That's the trailer. That's the
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:21.600]   actual trailer. The trailer came out and the internet exploded. They said we were getting
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:28.400]   nightmares. Talk about PTSD. Now didn't furry Pikachu cause the same kind of reaction? No,
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:33.920]   not in the same way. People love furry Pikachu. I'm just not going to be able to get out of my
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:38.720]   head for the rest of the day. People love furry Pikachu especially south of market.
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:44.640]   That's what the son this is the trailer that gave people nightmares. So I love Sonic. Grew up
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:51.680]   playing Sega. Is that Podge? That's a dude from Westworld. Oh shoot. He looks kind of like Podge.
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:56.000]   I don't know. Maybe he's just me but I thought that was chips all over again.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.600]   So well let's get to the Sonic part. He's just going to run it stuff. What's coming up? Yeah.
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:15.600]   Is it coming up? Oh it gets worse. Okay. So for once the movie studios listen to the internet.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:22.000]   They have put this movie on hold for at least three months. So then Sonic can be fixed.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:31.840]   The release date was originally November. They pushed it three months.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:38.240]   Now I have to say normally your prestige films come out around Christmas time because that way
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:45.600]   your Academy award chances are better. And usually when a movie comes out like a week or after the
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:51.520]   Oscars you kind of admitting no it's a turkey. They moved the date to February 14th.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.160]   I think this is basically saying yeah we're sorry. I'm sorry did you think a movie based on Sonic
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:03.200]   the Hedgehog really had a chance at comic. Did you detect it? Could you do a solid? I'm not saying
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.200]   you said Pikachu did. I'm saying that but you know okay Oscar what am I saying like the idea of a
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.960]   movie based on Pikachu doing you know being critically reviewed well is also different. Yeah
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.800]   they're not going to win an Oscar for that either. Okay I mean Jim Carrey is total Jim Carrey and
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:24.480]   being Dr. Robotnik. So like it's got good stuff in the trailer. It just doesn't look anything like
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:32.800]   Sonic. But Pikachu didn't either. I mean I never saw a furry Pikachu right? I guess I see that and I
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:39.600]   just see a first emulation or a skeletal mesh and that's I don't know. We should also mention
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:45.520]   this is another happy story. Elon Musk we've been giving him a lot of trouble for his
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:52.720]   Craig Kray stuff that he says. Including last month saying that next year there'd be 30,000
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:56:01.440]   self-driving Teslas on the road. Really? Where's than that? Operating like Uber as ride shares.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:06.960]   So that a Tesla owner which only you know he only uses his Tesla on average 22 for two hours
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:11.760]   a day. So there's 22 hours of unused time would flip a switch and say go ahead go out go out
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:17.200]   little Tesla. Where out your Tesla faster so I can tell it's a little more. It'd be a 30,000 a year
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:21.760]   letting me bring out your hundred thousand dollar car. Well three years you make your money back.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:27.680]   And buy a new car. I am not going to let the general public drive my car. Have you ever
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:33.680]   rented a taro and seen what the general public does? So the taro's with a cool idea which was
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:38.400]   that you could do that. I love it. And you love your car person. Oh yeah I love them. Yeah every
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.960]   time I got a taro's are like in bad shape when you get in them. It's always so I am and I know
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:47.920]   you disagree with me on this. I'm a Porsche fan. You're an ice girl. I know. Well though I want
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.640]   that ticon. Oh it's great. It's great. It looks so good. I will buy the boxer the second they put
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:57.680]   that out. Okay electric boxer. But it's like if you look at the cars on taro they will get a
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.520]   beautiful Porsche boxer and they will just destroy it and you'll get it and the vents are falling off
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:09.440]   and the clutch doesn't work well. We know this. Renders don't treat the property with the same
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:16.720]   care that the owner does. It's just the way it is. So anyway I wanted to give Elon credit because
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:24.160]   he's we give him a lot of you know. This is this is good. But he has done something once again SpaceX
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:30.160]   launched. I don't know if you watch this on Friday. I did. So excited. It was so cool. This is at
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:34.880]   Cape Canaveral. I love that. I would love to go to night launch because it's so beautiful. Oh it's
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:42.400]   great. They had a couple of scrub launches but round about 730 p.m. Pacific they were able to launch
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:51.600]   Starlink the Falcon 9. And here's what Starlink is going to do. They want to place 12,000 satellites
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:58.160]   all over the world to provide high speed gigabit low latency because it's in low earth orbit
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:03.280]   internet to every corner of the planet. That part kind of freaks me out. Well yeah. I like being
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:09.040]   able to go places and have no internet. Well too bad Patrick. Tell I want to do the podcast from a
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:15.600]   boat. And it looks like I might be. I'm I'm I'm deeply fascinated by this and I also I've read up
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:19.200]   enough of it to be like okay it's going to be less of a latency issue. I'm really curious to see
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:22.160]   what kind of bandwidth they'll be able to deliver. It's also funny with the idea that you know you
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:26.720]   may have to go to northern Nevada where the population is below like one person per square
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:32.400]   mile to get you know the badass bandwidth but it's it's fascinating. I bet I bet we'll get
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:35.360]   I do say every user on the satellite.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:43.840]   I think there's 12,000 of them. Oh of course there's a lot like how many people are there
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:50.240]   Bill. Yeah okay. Being here in a major city you know we're outside a major city. I think you can
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:54.640]   really take for granted that a lot of the United States still does not have access to decent
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:59.600]   internet. So big problem. Even in Massachusetts people think of us as a rich like you know
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:05.120]   advanced state. There are huge portions of the state where you're people are still on dial.
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:10.080]   No I remember in the early days of mapping apps on phones. I was like you know I told
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:16.080]   someone like I really need a nap that stores all the day locally and I was basically told that like
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:20.480]   I live in California what is my damage. I'm like I drive 15 minutes north of my house so still
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:26.160]   in San Francisco and I don't have network access. It's still like that. And that's even without
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:30.400]   getting into the really empty parts of the country. Sure sure. But it's also worth saying
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:36.400]   Tesla's a long history of promising the moon and then they put it out. We still don't have that
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.600]   solar tiles on our house or the energy wall. Like we got some work to do on that. Yeah.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:47.520]   And consumer reports just ding. Are they? Did they? Yeah actually I could get one they call me.
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:51.760]   Oh yeah I missed that. That's good to hear. Yeah they call me. It's basically you know what it is.
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:56.560]   It's just the Tesla battery pack on your wall. I buy it. That sounds great. I would love to have
[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:00.240]   it. Keep you know we have solar panels. We charge up the energy wall and
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:03.680]   night would run off that. I would have a concrete fence not attached to my house.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:08.880]   Are you afraid it's going to explode? I'm just saying all it takes is you know one
[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:10.720]   one of batteries ever exploded.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:20.000]   Let me tell you a story about a phone driving his Model X around. By the way consumer reports did
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:26.400]   ding the autopilot. Apparently Elon really wants to get to the point where the cars you just say go
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:31.120]   and they drive. And one of the key features would be the ability to change lanes.
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:37.840]   Consumer reports that do not use the new automatic lane changing feature. It's worse than a human
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:46.080]   driver cuts off cars. In some cases it breaks laws if you turn it on. And they said you know
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:52.480]   normally we think of these things as driver assist. In this case this is the driver has to
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.760]   keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't do the wrong thing. It's not making your life easier.
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:06.160]   So again Elon you win some you lose some. I realize I'm in the minority here. I won't even
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:12.640]   drive a car with an automatic transmission. Like you just like you just love to drive. I can't
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:20.000]   I can't imagine having Mr. Stickshift Bondi here. What are you really? Yeah. That's taste. You should
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:27.680]   listen. I just got just last year got a manual transmission car. Oh yeah. And I'm oh it's so
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:34.240]   much work. You're pushing the pedal. You're doing the thing. You got it. It's so much work. It's great.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:38.320]   It's great. It's just bought a Chevy Bolt doesn't even have like I mean all
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:46.240]   there's really two gears forward and backward. I love it. It's great. That's the best that's how
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:51.200]   it should be. But do the doors dance? No that doesn't have dancing doors but it's only on the
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:56.640]   bright side. It's only 30,000. I could buy four bolts for what I paid for my whole X.
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:03.440]   Sorry the Model X goes back in a couple of months. And I was looking for it in the parking lot.
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:08.240]   Didn't see it. It's not there. That bright blue. See the bolt vehicle. It's a bolt. All electric
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.080]   bolts. It's charming. Bolt.
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:19.120]   Oh there's so many more things to talk about. I wanted to get all of this stuff in. And all the
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:23.440]   good ones. Did I get all the good ones? Are you sure? Let me let's check.
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:32.240]   WWC coming on June 3rd. My son will will not be happy with me if I don't make you do the loot box
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:39.120]   story. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Actually I want Brianna's comment on this. The Senate. My son is afraid that
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:46.320]   the mobile gaming all mobile gaming developers will go out of business. It's a legit worry.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:55.600]   Yes. So Josh Hawley passed or a filed legislation on Thursday. The Protecting Children from Abusive
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:03.200]   Games Act or Pekaga. That's not very good. It would prohibit game developers from adding both loot
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:10.320]   boxes and pay-to-win microtransactions to a game targeted to those 18 or younger or games where the
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:15.600]   game makers know those under 18 are playing. So that's pretty much every game right? You can't say.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:22.080]   Oh yeah. This is only 19 year olds to play this one. Ed Markey from your home state.
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:25.760]   Is it good guy? He's actually a great senator. Dick Loominsall from Connecticut. Also a good
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:33.360]   senator also sponsoring the bill. Hawley said he's a Republican from Missouri. Only the addiction
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:38.800]   economy could produce a business model that relies on placing a casino in the hands of every child
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:42.400]   in America with the goal of getting them desperately hooked. I can't say I disagree.
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:49.200]   Loot boxes. What's a loot box? Well it's a it's a roulette wheel right? So if you are playing a game
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.560]   say Fortnite and you want a particular skin you've got to keep playing or you need to pay money
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:04:00.000]   until you get the item that you want. It shows up in a loot box and then you have it. Sometimes
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:07.280]   the things in a loot box are cosmetic like a cool costume. Sometimes they break the game or it's
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:12.720]   pay-to-win. But the key is that it's random. It's random. You don't know what you're going to buy.
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:16.880]   Correct. Exactly. So it's gambling in the sense that it's going to cost you five bucks or 10 bucks.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:23.360]   What? You might get it. Turn on your microphone. It's not on. Oh sorry. You might get it or you
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:28.320]   might not. Right. Basically. Yes. Oh so the loot box isn't like a box and it's like a grab
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:32.640]   bag where you don't know what's in it. No it's like a guy. It's they say you could get.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:38.000]   That's exactly it. Yeah. They're very popular in gotcha games where they're like
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:46.800]   kind of like Pokemon. You're collecting all these animals and so you get an egg that will hatch
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:52.480]   an animal and it might be a good animal or it might be a bad animal. Right. But you don't pay
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:59.280]   for it in Pokemon Go. Whereas you would be these loot boxes. So it's not a it's not it's a bill.
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:04.160]   It's not it's not even going to committee yet. They're of course Congress is in recess until
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:10.720]   next month. But what do you think? Well I can really see both sides of this. You know the truth is that
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:16.720]   the game industry has really moved away from the point where you pay $60 for a game and you own
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:23.440]   that game and you just play that game. There's DLC in our industry is very very dependent on
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:29.120]   you know this additional revenue. Fortnite was free to play but but Tim Sweeney made $7 billion
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:38.320]   last year. So it is a it is a model that has really helped our industry. And I also think it's
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:43.440]   worth saying it has been Leo has been the most brutal year for the game industry.
[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:49.520]   Really lost telltale blizzard laid off a ton of people half the people I know in the industry
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:54.880]   out of work. It has really been a rough year. I have to say though having been here for a few
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:59.920]   decades. Yeah there have been cycles like this before. And it's partly because the video game
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:04.160]   industry is hit driven right like the movie industry. They make a lot of games are expensive
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:10.320]   to make they're gambling there be hits most of them are not. So those people lose their jobs and
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:16.960]   then some people like epic get big wins. Sure well in this particular case they they figured out
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:22.640]   a free to play mechanic that really drove growth and exploded revenues and they're kind of expecting
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:30.400]   that growth to go on forever. This is the downside to this. If I'm an adult and I play something like
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:37.520]   Final Fantasy a new realm which is the most egregious pay-to-win game you will ever play in your entire
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:45.760]   life. I know people that have spent $40,000 on that game. What I do I swear adults. If an adult
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:50.240]   wants to make that bad choice. That's their bad choice. That's their bad choice just like going
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:56.560]   to Vegas. We do most states restrict gambling not that's changing very rapidly.
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:07:02.800]   Right. Thanks a lot of re. But so yeah isn't it parents jobs to keep their kids from doing this.
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:07.520]   I mean it's not a hard thing to keep your kid from buying loot boxes. It's very hard. It's very hard.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:13.120]   Why is it hard you just don't give them purchase access. How are they buying stuff.
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:17.440]   Think of all the things as a parent you were able to prevent your children from doing.
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:21.600]   Well the one thing is don't give them the gosh darn credit card.
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:28.000]   Okay so they're not going to go down to the supermarket the 7-11 the Home Depot or any other
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.440]   thing with an end cap that allows them to turn their cash into a credit card.
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:39.920]   I mean I've raised a couple of creative little problem solvers so I'm pretty sure at some point
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:44.000]   if they need to figure out how to get credit card access my little campers are going to trot down
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.160]   and put two people through a terrible thing. I don't think we should pass a federal law.
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:53.920]   Yeah. Restricting loot boxes. This is this is the middle ground I would like to see.
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:59.520]   If you're going to have loot box mechanics in the game I think you should have to publish the odds.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:04.560]   There you go. Get it. Add certain things just like you do in Vegas with slot machines.
[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:09.440]   That makes sense. You have a thing little warning at the bottom with a number for the
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:13.280]   game addicts hop and I would like to point out just exactly how well that's done in limiting the
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:17.760]   amount of slot. I mean I agree with you. It's more of a. I'm being snarky. Everybody's got a
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:24.720]   family member who spent fortunes on the ponies of Santa Anita or the Greyhound.
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:28.480]   Yeah I would say about this though. The reason that's important is because
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:33.680]   you literally have game developers that sit there and have all the information. How often you
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:39.600]   log in what you want to do. They will adjust the odds which is exactly the people that have the
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:43.840]   most control in Las Vegas casinos are the ones that manipulate the slot machines because that's
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:50.960]   where most of the revenue comes from. It's like I could sat and doing the word for the people
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.400]   that do the statistics for insurance companies. All of those people. All of those actuaries
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:00.720]   the really insane ones all migrated to casinos but I'm with you but it's also crazy when you think
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:05.600]   like people have paid I think play to win games or pay to win games are kind of a nightmare in
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:12.960]   general kind of ruins gaming. I agree and you know apples with its arcade plus trying to create a new
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:19.200]   economy for games. I think there are responsible people. Stadia might be a solution as well. The
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:23.760]   Google solution. There are responsible people trying to try to fix this. I don't know if Google
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:28.320]   should fix it. I just think they're trying to get away around. Yeah in fact I would argue Stadia is
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:33.440]   going to accelerate this because you're not paying for it so it's going to like increase
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:37.600]   the revenue source. They need a revenue source. We need a revenue source. Well you are paying
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:40.720]   because you'll probably have a monthly subscription which will be divvied up. That's fair. That's
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:46.400]   fair. Mike Microsoft has a similar thing with Game Pass. I mean this is Sony does the same thing.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:51.120]   But I'll be honest with you like at this point the number of games on my phone I've stopped playing
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:56.160]   because I paid for a game and they're still advertisements. You know that at this point is
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:01.760]   just there's so much about game developers need to make money. They can't make enough money. You
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:05.760]   know is they can't make enough money off a single sale or is it just too lucrative to not do the
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:10.080]   additional stuff. Look at most people like Pokemon Go. I've probably spent a couple hundred bucks
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:15.440]   playing Pokemon Go. But I got at least at least that much value out of it over three years. I really
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:21.440]   enjoyed the game. I don't feel like they extorted money out of me. I paid for things that made sense
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:27.360]   strategically. I got to level 40. I've deleted the game now because I did and that was level 40.
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:30.800]   Well at once you get to that's the highest level. Once you know I know like what's the point. That's
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:37.600]   impressive. Tell Frank I'm at 40. He'd be very jealous. Mike Trump. But as soon as Harry Potter
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:42.960]   Wizards unite comes out. See I'm just I'm clearing the deck. I'm clearing the deck because I'm ready
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.960]   and I will spend what I won't worry about. But I should I play you hitting level 40. We've got a
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:56.000]   promo that's got that. Oh I forgot let's watch. It was so much fun. We gotta play a video. Okay.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:06.000]   I am now level 40. Now you've got to encase that phone in a block of Lucite
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.280]   with like enough room for the power cord. So you just keep it as a monument.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:23.360]   Security now. Windows XP Leo not Windows 8 not Windows 7 was patched last week. So you know
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:31.360]   something is worrying Microsoft deeply while we have observed no exploitation of this vulnerability.
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:40.320]   This is Microsoft saying it is highly likely that malicious actors will write an exploit
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:46.800]   for this vulnerability. And I have to say that I love the fact that the world is finally sitting
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:53.920]   up and taking sober responsibility for these sorts of problems. All about Android Lenovo
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:58.640]   shared a video and a press event to show off renders of the as yet unannounced folding Moto
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:04.240]   Razer phone. What are you gaining from this fold? We are returning to the ability to effectively
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:09.920]   hang up angrily on someone. Yes. Right. It's ever since the emergence of the smartphone. You've
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:16.480]   never been able to go. Fine. Goodbye. Right. You know now I can close that I can close that
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:20.720]   foldable phone and hang up on someone that I'm angry at. Oh that was so satisfying to do that.
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:29.280]   Twit. You heard me. That's the great Jim Cutler our our video guy. He's great. Yeah. But once I
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:34.560]   got to level 40 they didn't show that I deleted it. Wow. Done. You saw did you sell that? I'm perfect
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:40.320]   Pokemon. No I didn't. Like what is it? Pokemon pros you can sell that account and people buy it
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:45.440]   for two hundred forty seven dollars. What? I swear to God. I swear to God. I don't need it. What a
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.040]   fool. I'm on. I still have your account. Oh yeah. But it's my Google account. I'm not selling you
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:53.680]   my Google account. Hell with that. It's worth one turn forty seven. I see you in the parking lot.
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:13:01.600]   Ask Frank what he's willing to pay. No but the point was before the promo the point was I wouldn't
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.000]   be sad if I couldn't play some of those games because it was governmentally regulated.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.520]   I'd be sad if I couldn't drink. That was look how well that went when we had prohibition.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:20.560]   Have parents do their job and maybe maybe put the odds on but I don't think we could we should
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:25.840]   ban that kind of stuff. That's I'm sorry. I think our industry could do a better job of informing
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.560]   parents about the tools that exist to kind of limit these things there and I think it fails.
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:34.640]   And there aren't. There are tools but we're not doing well at communicating about them. Because it's bad
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:39.280]   for the bottom line in some cases. And by the way I wasn't joking when I said the World Health
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:45.440]   Organization has made gaming disorder a recognized illness. Classification will come
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:52.640]   effect January 1st 2022. So get all get as much gaming in as you can for the next two years. Ladies
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:58.560]   and gentlemen what fun having Brianna Wu visit us in studio. Good luck. When's the when's the primary?
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:04.560]   September 20th. Secretary of State finally put that out next year. And what's the website to
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:09.280]   support you? You can go to support Brianna.com. We were talking about call time earlier. You know
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:15.200]   the number one like number one people that donate to my campaign are because we've done analytics on
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:22.160]   this. Are people that watch your show? Support our campaign. All right. Twitter me. Assemble.
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:27.680]   Five dollars. That's all I ask. Brianna Wu for Congress because don't you want somebody this
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:32.640]   smart sitting in Congress and you don't have to be from Massachusetts, the safe district. No you don't.
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:38.480]   But if you are vote and vote often come September for Brianna Wu all the best. It's great to see
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:44.720]   you. Your brain is so big. So big. Patrick Norton. It's not the only thing is your brain is big.
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:53.600]   Everything about you is largely making this a long way. I was this week in computer hardware
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:57.840]   with Sebastian Pete quits weekly show the names to bring you the most useful and helpful hardware
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:03.440]   news on all student avie excel that wonderful. I think that you is bigger than life. Okay. That's
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:08.560]   good. That wasn't where you were. That was where I was headed. Okay. But you were sort of ambling
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:14.080]   about. There was a whole cliff and we were all fearing. This is about to be a different show.
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.840]   I love you, man. Patrick Norton this week in computer hardware of course tech thing tech
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:25.920]   thing.com support him because you do this on patreon. Yes. Oh, this is the kind of thing that we also
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:32.720]   really want to support is Patrick and his great shows. Thank you, Patrick. If I support you on
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:38.720]   patreon, we look at my Oculus PC and tell me how to upgrade that. Absolutely. You don't even have
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:44.080]   to support just email. All right. Tweet us. You seem like you know more about processors than I do.
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.800]   He knows everything. Yes. But I can't code my way out of a paper bag. Just one tip. If he comes to
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:54.880]   the house with a sledgehammer, do not let him in. Okay. Just saying. Okay. Good advice for anyone.
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:58.640]   Good advice. Yeah. And really basically. Especially if you have horse hare plaster.
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:02.480]   Yes. Luckily, if I show up at your door with a sledgehammer, it's probably because you did something.
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:10.160]   Uh oh. Uh oh. Lock the door. Goes on. Our show appears on the Twitter network every Sunday. Actually,
