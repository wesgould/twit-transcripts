[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.200]   This week in tech, the show that covers technology news,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.200]   we bring on some of the best minds in the tech community,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.720]   the journalistic community, to talk about the week's tech news.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.480]   And we have a great panel this week.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.520]   I'm really glad to have Joshua Topolsky back.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.480]   He is the editor-in-chief of Engadget Magazine.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.240]   Hi, Josh.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.560]   Good to have you back.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.520]   Good to be back.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.400]   Also with us, Mr. Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800]   at-- we've been trying to get Dwight on all summer,
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.960]   but he's just kind of busy schedule.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.000]   Traveling, man.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.680]   But I'm here.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.240]   I'm ready.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.920]   Let's party.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.680]   He's at party.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.960]   Blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.120]   And lo and behold, long time no see, Mr. Will Harris,
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.600]   who is rapidly coming up to be the--
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.200]   what is it, the number two most often used?
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   Oh, no.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.960]   I've got a wall to catch Patrick, I think.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.840]   Oh, well, Will.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.720]   We love having Will on.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.360]   He hasn't been on a while from channelflip.com in the UK.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.520]   And you're on because this is Soccer Sunday all over the world.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.640]   Yeah, baby.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.480]   We won't give you any spoilers.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.800]   You're like Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live, right?
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.720]   Steve Martin has the most hosts and then--
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.560]   Alec Baldwin.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.600]   Absolutely.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.160]   Absolutely.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.440]   I'm trying my best.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.840]   Almost as good looking.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.160]   Oh, that hurts.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.680]   That's gotta.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.680]   Ooh.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   Well, who can forget Alec Baldwin's Skype performance
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.480]   in It's Complicated.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.240]   It's burned into my brain, that's for sure.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.360]   You probably didn't see it.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.960]   It's a chick flick.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.680]   I got dragged there by my wife.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.160]   And then I had to see it again in Blu-ray.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.320]   And it's--
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.520]   He had to buy it and see it again.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.560]   Yeah, I had to.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.800]   He is flirting with Meryl Streep.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.640]   They have a Skype call going on--
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.480]   Or maybe Meryl Streep has a Skype call going on with Steve
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.080]   Martin.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.360]   And they're having a little thing.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.760]   But her ex-husband, Alex Baldwin,
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.000]   decides to sneak into her bed naked.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.880]   Doesn't realize the Skype is there.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.800]   Steve Martin comes back to Skype for a while.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.680]   And there's a big fat naked Alec Baldwin on Skype.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.720]   It's a great moment for Skype, I think.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   Big fat sexy.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.960]   Big fat naked.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.000]   It makes you want to Skype.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.680]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.480]   Now I don't have to go and see that film.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.800]   Spoiler alert.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.640]   Yeah, you're reading the World Cup.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.920]   We will not say who won the World Cup, although somebody
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.040]   has won the World Cup.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.080]   We will not-- I promise-- blow the vuvuzela anytime soon.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.560]   Or anytime in the show.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.400]   It was definitely a soccer soccer.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.720]   It was a European team.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.240]   So even though England didn't make it to the end,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.960]   I think that there must be some happiness in the Northern
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.440]   hemisphere, right?
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.160]   Well, it was nice to have an all European final.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.000]   That was nuts.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.040]   Do you consider England--
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.480]   England's not in Europe, is it?
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.200]   Well, technically, we are, yes.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.320]   You're in the EU.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.600]   We are a member of the European Union.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.000]   But geographically--
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.520]   Geographically.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.880]   Something about the British character
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.720]   that doesn't quite gel with the European--
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.240]   I didn't know.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.080]   No gal-waz.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.640]   We're a little bit less refined, I think.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.640]   Is that it?
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.920]   Then the rest of Europe.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.840]   Is that it?
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.000]   A little bit more blunt.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.720]   But geographically, Leo, I think they
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.560]   are geographically part of Europe.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.880]   Are they?
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.680]   I always thought that Europe was not everything but England.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.480]   And then there's the UK.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.680]   Well, there's some people in England
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.080]   who'd be very happy with that.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.560]   But strictly speaking, yes, we are all Europeans.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.240]   I don't know.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.800]   This is not what the show is all about.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   God knows.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.720]   It is about-- it is no.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   I'm a much richer.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.960]   One of the reasons I'm glad Joshua's here,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.240]   because one of the things this show has been about
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.400]   for the last few weeks is smartphones.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.640]   In fact, in many ways, technology talk these days
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.320]   is more about smartphones than it is about computers.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.400]   And it is about-- we don't talk about net books or PCs
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.720]   or desktops or laptops.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.160]   We talk about smartphones.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.520]   I get complaints from smart phones.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520]   That's where the end of the issue is happening.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.800]   You get complaints?
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.680]   Yeah, I get complaints from old school readers who say,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.720]   this is a tech blog.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.920]   You should be talking about Windows.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.600]   We just got a complaint today like that.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.760]   We get those all the time.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.920]   But you're in gadget, in gadget, gadget.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   I know.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.800]   We're trying to cover gadgets.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   I dare we cover the hot new gadgets.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.760]   I always thought, actually, gadget was kind of a pejorative,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.880]   kind of a diminutive phrase.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.640]   And I never liked doing--
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.040]   whenever I do mainstream and I stop doing that pretty much
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.760]   television, they always wanted gadgets.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.880]   We want to see gadgets.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.280]   Like, that was not as scary to people as talking--
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.240]   or boring, mostly, as talking about a technology
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.520]   about computers, about the internet was.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.760]   But gadgets isn't really appropriate when you talk about
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.920]   a smartphone that has more power than your computer did
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.680]   five years ago.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.280]   Well, I mean, it's what was a gadget something you might have
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.640]   because it's cool or fun to use or you're a complete nerd.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.720]   Now, everybody has one and they're much more powerful.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   I mean, is it-- I don't-- I mean, gadget, I kind of--
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.680]   I feel like it still applies.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.320]   I think there's something about a smartphone that is almost
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.440]   like the perfect--
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.880]   it's the perfect gadget.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.440]   It is the ultimate gadget.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.920]   I think that-- and I think that's why we cover them so much.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.680]   So I feel like it really works really well
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680]   with when it comes to smartphones.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.520]   And we have to think about--
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.760]   when you look back to what our early mid-90s definitions
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.640]   of gadgets were, you know, this little James Bond stuff.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.400]   And smartphones really are the--
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.240]   They are, aren't they?
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.440]   You know, video conferencing everywhere.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.800]   It's the equivalent of the old--
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.520]   you know, the video screen on your watch or whatever,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.000]   where you're talking to somebody.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.080]   You know, who can say that FaceTime isn't exactly that.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.600]   Right.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.040]   You know, knowing exactly where you are at any point in the world,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.400]   you know, how to get to an or else,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.040]   the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you know.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.080]   It is. It's the book.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.800]   All it needs is a button that says, don't panic and you're said.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.240]   I mean, for that app, but--
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.760]   They must have--
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.000]   Don't panic right there.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.800]   Does it?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   I think we're at the point with gadgets or smartphones
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.040]   that we were with PCs, say, in the late '90s
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.520]   and that the best is yet to come and that these are--
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.680]   you know, we're in that same growth period that happened
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.440]   when Windows was, you know, about to be on every desktop.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.120]   The Mac was dying, unfortunately, at the time.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.160]   And I think that it is a--
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.400]   that what we're going to see in the next 10 years
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.480]   is just going to blow our minds compared to what we have right now.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.640]   I have to agree.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.680]   I have to say, I think that the innovation we're seeing
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.680]   in the mobile space right now is just unbelievable.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.120]   I mean, it's unbridled, you know.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.000]   It's like the brakes have been taken off
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.560]   and we have this whole new space to explore,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.280]   this entirely new platform, really, where you can do a lot of things
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.080]   you could never do with the computer.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.400]   And the-- I think the reason why we cover it so much
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.920]   and the reason why we're talking about it so much
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.760]   is that the amount of technological innovation
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.640]   that's happening in the smartphone space is unparalleled,
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.400]   except maybe when you look at the PC race, when it really got going,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.480]   when people really started figuring out, hey,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.640]   you can get these things in your home, look at all the stuff you can do with them.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.720]   I think it's-- there's some big ones, you know, PCs, Internet,
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.040]   and I think this mobile space, the mobile internet,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.560]   smart devices is just barely tapped at this point.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.520]   Let me get a little philosophical on you.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.560]   Do you think the rate of innovation is constant?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.840]   In other words, the human condition is such that we will innovate.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.080]   But what happens is our attention shifts from platform to platform.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.240]   So then now that the PC platform is mature
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.080]   and really we've seen it both Windows 7 and OS 10, Snow Leopard,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.200]   there's not a lot you can do new.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.600]   You know, all of the-- both of these were refinements of an existing OS.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.360]   Maybe our attention is now shifting to a platform
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   where there is more scope for innovation.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.080]   Do you think that that's the case that it's just kind of a constant?
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.240]   We just are looking for an outlet and this is what the smartphone has become?
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.320]   Well, I think there's a degree to which the innovation has been driven by hardware,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.200]   or the lack of hardware innovation.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.440]   I mean, the sort of PC massive race that we talked about,
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.600]   you know, we were just talking about was when, you know,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.240]   Intel was constantly making new chips, the gigahertz were going from 200 megahertz
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.760]   to 1 gigahertz to 2 gigahertz to 3 gigahertz to beyond to multi-course,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.840]   and all these kind of things. And that's kind of tapered off now.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.040]   You know, we haven't seen a processor ever hit--
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.280]   That's true. We all get to make sure you release your mental.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.800]   We're done.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.400]   So what we've seen now is that all the innovation in the hardware is now moving
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.120]   into the mobile space, things like the A4 chip,
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.520]   which suddenly allow you to start really accelerating that pace of change
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.320]   in the mobile space as well.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.560]   And so I think although there's definitely an element of, you know,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.720]   we're sort of choosing to move between spaces,
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.600]   I think there's a good degree of, you know,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.640]   it's dictated by what the hardware guys can actually make happen.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.480]   The traditional conventional wisdom is that hardware outpaces software,
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.560]   so that you get a lot of innovation in hardware,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.720]   and then software is kind of slow to catch up and take advantage of it.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.000]   Are we in that-- do I-- do I-- do I think we're in that situation now with smartphones
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.200]   that the hardware is outpacing what the software's capable of?
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.800]   I would say definitely with one exception, and that is that because Apple is
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.400]   controlling both the hardware and the software,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.080]   I think that maybe within that space and on that particular platform,
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.680]   you know, they-- you may have a neck and neck situation that--
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.600]   Well, but yeah, but you can see like the retina display,
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.200]   I mean, as good as it is when I look at stuff on my iPhone 4,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.480]   very few apps are yet taking advantage of the retina display.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   Well, it just-- they just released it.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.240]   You got to give them time.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.880]   I'm in a hurry.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.280]   Come on now.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.280]   But, you know, I think you--
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.200]   I was pointing to you say-- at what point do you say hardware is ahead of it?
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.800]   I mean, you're already starting to see apps that do take advantage of the better display.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.840]   The reading apps look much better for those that have done it.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.200]   It's not that hard to do.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.880]   The libraries are in the software development kit that Apple releases.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.960]   So on Android, I think you have more of an opportunity to kind of have catch up for the
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.600]   software because it's almost all independent.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.160]   Google gives you the libraries.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.680]   It gives you the design.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.760]   But ultimately, it's going to be up to the developers to see if they can make the potential
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.280]   of it.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.720]   I think Apple delivers more of the potential faster.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:58.000]   You know, I think that this touches on something that has been an issue in the desktop and laptop
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.160]   space, which is a real lack of innovation in that software.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.720]   I mean, it seems like people hit a point and they said, this is what a desktop environment
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.960]   is going to be like and we're good with this.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.960]   Let's not innovate anymore.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.840]   I mean, you have to think about OS 10.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.720]   It's built on Unix.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   Windows has been Windows for ages.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   And you've got Linux.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.320]   And Linux is built on Unix really as well.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.760]   I mean, it's a very similar concept.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.120]   So you've got two of the big ones built on the basically the same thing.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.000]   You've got Windows, which hasn't changed and arguably hasn't changed drastically in,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.760]   you know, 15 years or 10 years.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.400]   So there's not a lot of innovation happening.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.440]   And I don't know if that's just because people have become comfortable with what's available
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.120]   or there aren't any good ideas out there.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.200]   But what's interesting is you're starting to see the mobile space sort of loop back around
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.880]   and impact the desktop and laptop space.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.880]   So we're getting used to all this touch input, all this gesture based stuff.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.400]   And that's starting to creep into how we interact with our laptops and our desktops.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.160]   And I think that'll hopefully spur some of that some of that innovation.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.840]   I wouldn't be surprised if you don't see in the next version of the Mac OS that it looks
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.920]   a lot like the iOS based off the iPad.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:14.160]   There are rumors that yeah, Apple may even abandon OS 10 and kind of start doing an iOS.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.720]   I think there's probably at least one more release of OS 10 out there.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.120]   I have to admit that I keep touching my screen on my laptop.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.880]   I've now become I've come to the expectation that I can manipulate it with my bare hands.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   But you know what?
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.680]   That is not that is not comfortable.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.040]   That's not comfortable to be cho.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   Yeah, I do.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.800]   And like do this on a on a desktop.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   It's not.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.880]   But on a laptop, it's a little more intimate.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.760]   I could do that on a laptop.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:48.600]   But still if you use the iPad in the dock or with the wireless, the Bluetooth keyboard
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.960]   and it's in the case and when you have to do something on the screen that you would normally
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.000]   do with a mouse, you want to reach for a minute.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Touch it.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Right.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   That's kind of weird.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It's kind of irritating.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   That's kind of weird.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But that's what I'm saying Dwight.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.720]   I think that that's because we're dinosaurs we're used to the mass and keyboard.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.440]   I think if a generation grows up with touchscreen devices, whether it's the iPad or something
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.360]   else, they're going to get used to that.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.240]   It's going to, I think that in many ways, maybe the form factor of the future.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.640]   Well, but I think so.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.160]   Or is on the panel thinks so.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   It's just you and me, John.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.600]   I actually think the iPad doesn't go far enough.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.800]   I mean, I was pretty disappointed and I remained sort of underwhelmed by what Apple did in
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   the iPad OS.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.400]   I think, you know, it's basically iOS through and through.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.960]   There's not a, there's nothing that really feels like it's made for the iPad in that
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.320]   version of iOS.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.200]   So I think that Apple could go further and I think that, you know, what you're saying
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.880]   about it, you know, is the tablet going to be what the laptop becomes?
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.600]   You know, I think it probably will be.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.200]   They just have to come up with a much more intuitive and comfortable way to use it.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.920]   I mean, I think the iPad is okay, but I don't think that you can just slap the iPhone OS
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.680]   on a larger tablet and make it.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.240]   Do you think we'll have all of them?
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.000]   All of the above, you have a touch screen, you'll have a mouse.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.880]   I mean, there are some PCs with that form factor.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.000]   You'll have a trackpad, you'll have one of those nipple devices on the keyboard.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   You'll have a head mount sensor.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.720]   I think the nipples are well gone there.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720]   I hope so.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   Let's hope so.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   Surely it's time to disconnect.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.720]   You'll have Microsoft connect.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.600]   In fact, I think Microsoft is implying that connect will make it into Windows 8.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.440]   They talked about using sort of motion.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.200]   A sense from that slide, that leaked slide of Windows 8 is that it would have all of
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   the above.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.640]   Oh, you know, Microsoft, they always have lofty goals.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   And they have a huge R&D department.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.280]   I mean, you'd be blown away.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.880]   How much do you make it in?
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   Right.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.720]   Like the courier, you remember how awesome that looked?
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.280]   And they work on stuff like that 24 hours a day and then you see...
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.560]   Well, even the file system, do you remember the debacle of the file system for Windows
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   Vista?
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   Longhorn.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.560]   There was this Longhorn to win a test.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.920]   The Windows 8 system that they did the whole thing and then they just canned it.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.080]   And now they're talking about Windows 8 and there's no mention at all of any change in
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   the file system.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   Still in TFS.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   What about the cloud?
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   What is their cloud?
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   As sure.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   That's right.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   That's right.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.240]   And is that going to be tied into 8 or is that just an experiment?
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.240]   Who the hell knows what that is?
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.080]   It's going to be tied to Ray Aussie's ankle for the rest of his life is what's going
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   to be.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.240]   But I mean, it could be easily if, you know, we talked about the idea of it not being
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.720]   comfortable reaching up and touching your screen.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.880]   But if you were reading on a notebook computer or on a desktop and you want to turn the page
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.440]   and you just do this in the air, that's natural.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440]   That's natural.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.440]   It's very natural.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   Or you know, to do like this.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.040]   Well, let's not have to reach up.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.440]   That's, I think that that I would like that.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.800]   Let's talk about one of the forces that's going to impede all of this and then we really
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   got to do something about which is patents.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   And there are two patents that were in the news this week that really do impact that.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.440]   One is Microsoft says we're going to apply for a patent for the page curl.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.880]   The turn where you see the page and you see the back of the page and you see the front
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.680]   of the next page as it turns over.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.360]   First of all, let's get rid of that please.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.480]   But apparently Microsoft thinks it's important enough to patent it.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.480]   Is this, I mean, I guess why not patent it?
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.360]   Do you think the page turn has much, much, much life in it?
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.320]   Do you guys like it?
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.240]   I turn it off immediately.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.560]   I do like the page turn.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.000]   I think it's a, you know, I found that when I started using iBooks, I realized I did something
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.960]   with books that I wasn't even aware of, which is when I'm reading, I'll kind of curl the
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.600]   edge of the page while I'm reading.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.120]   This is a weird little tick and I noticed myself doing it a little bit when I read in iBooks,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.880]   which is maybe disturbing or weird.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   What do you mean?
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.120]   You actually hold your finger in the corner and kind of slowly.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.640]   Just kind of, I just kind of run my fingers along the pages on the side, you know what?
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.280]   And I'm usually shirtless.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.240]   That's it, which is a good team.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.800]   Very sexy stuff.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.400]   Thank God it doesn't have a camera.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:59.160]   But I think it adds a little, I think we need some of that humanness in the design.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.400]   I think Apple understands that better than almost anybody.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.800]   Let's add the thing that maybe is superfluous, but also makes it feel a little bit more human
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.640]   and tangible and real.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.160]   So I like the page turn.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.320]   Is it patentable?
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.160]   That to me doesn't seem, that doesn't make sense to me.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.360]   You could patent the process involved in making it happen in software.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   Yeah, the code.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   The code is bad.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:27.760]   But surely so much prior art into one of the people have done this before, haven't they?
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.680]   I'm sure the hyper cage type card probably had it.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.320]   It does seem like it's a little late in the game for patenting the page turn.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.280]   There's two things you could do on the iPad with.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.320]   I don't know how well this will show up, but you can do the page turn like this.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   Right.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   We saw that.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.600]   Or you could also, if you don't want the page turn, you can just tap it.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   Right.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   And you still got a page turn there.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.480]   You still have kind of a look to it.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.160]   And this is the Kindle app.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160]   See, I turn that off.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.680]   There's a basic page turn in the Kindle you could turn on in the settings that just, you
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   tap it and slides.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.800]   You don't get that thing.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.120]   I turned that off.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.120]   You hate the page turn.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.200]   I don't hate it, but it's like, why waste the time?
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.880]   I know I'm turning the page.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.880]   You're so busy.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.600]   You're like, I can't wait for the thing.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   There's no physical.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.520]   What do you, you know, I always, I actually think that I understand why initially when
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.760]   new technologies come along, you make them look like the analog world.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:24.600]   But at some point, that is kind of a little concrete and you could probably let go of
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   that.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.920]   But it feels to me like Apple is like having a mouse pointer to look like a hand.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.320]   Remember in the early days of the of the mouse, it was a hand like that made you feel
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.320]   it better.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   Click a link.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   When you, it's still in browser.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   So yeah, that's right.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.640]   I mean, it seems to me like Apple is just trying to make this stuff more accessible.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   Right.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.400]   They're just trying to make it more familiar and less like it's this scary digital thing
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.720]   and more like it's an experience you can relate to.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.520]   It's like the whole desktop metaphor.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.800]   We could have left the desktop metaphor a long time ago.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   Yeah, we did.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   They're probably.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   Yeah, they're probably.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   It's familiar.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   It's probably holding us back though.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   There's probably a better way.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   It's familiar.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.240]   Well, but books, but books have, I mean, come on, they've been around a while.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.400]   Books have really made their mark.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   Don't you think so?
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   I think a little bit.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   But that's the negative.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.720]   But by, by being bounced to this notion that what you have is a stack of dead tree material
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:21.640]   that you're turning, it binds you to a concept of your, of serial data that isn't required
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.280]   by the form.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.960]   And so I think it limits the form and it means, you know, some forms.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   Okay.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   Some forms.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   What would you like?
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   How do you like?
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.500]   I mean, I have to get out of that mindset too where I'm also in that box, but I'm thinking
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.920]   for instance, I'm sure you'll see this that books no longer are static text on a physical
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920]   page.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.800]   For instance, why do we turn a page at all?
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.680]   Why don't I just scroll up?
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.080]   Why do I need a, what's this, what's this page have anything to do with anything?
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.520]   It's, it was because we couldn't make an infinite scroll of paper.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.520]   So get rid of it.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:58.720]   Well, you know, when you look at on a web page and a long, long, long scroll, people
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   don't like that.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   That's true.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.720]   They want a page.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   No, you're right.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.240]   And I think there's a middle break that you have to make with the page.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.040]   And also Apple is about making things comfortable, warm and fuzzy.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.600]   You know, there's that's, I, one of the slides that they've done, they did this both at
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.280]   the iPhone four announcement and the iPad announcement, the intersection of liberal
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   arts and technology.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.840]   Yeah, I actually like that.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   Exactly speaks to that.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   I love that sign.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   But I like it.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   Makes sense.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   I made sense.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.320]   I think some, I think some forms need limitations.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.520]   I think that they don't necessarily, you shouldn't say, well, let's just blow apart the concept
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.600]   of a book, you know, look, why do I need words in a book?
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.400]   Why can't it just be a sound or something?
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   Well, it might be.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.480]   I think that, well, yeah, but I think that, you know, you get people who say, well, every
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.720]   word should hot link out to something else.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.920]   And there should be all sorts of contextual stuff going on.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:52.960]   And there is something that is valuable in the isolated straightforward experience of
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960]   book reading.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.800]   So the page turning, you know, things separated by pages and that even that animation which
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.680]   ties into it isn't necessarily, I don't think it's necessarily evil or it should be,
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   should be exercised.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.880]   You know, I think that I think there's some value to the isolated straightforward experience
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.040]   of reading a book.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   Another, another Pat.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.560]   And they applied for by Amazon, could hurt Barnes and Noble, it, the patent and could
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.760]   have hurt the courier.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.280]   Maybe this is why Microsoft killed the courier.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.040]   It was a patent on dual screen technology.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.560]   What exactly Dwight was it that they were claiming?
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.880]   They're looking at right now, the nook has this has two screens on it.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.520]   This is the nook is, which is, which is, by the way, it's chief advantage as a color
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.320]   strip running and really think.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.320]   Yes.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   Right.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.920]   And it's running and it's the, it may be an advantage depending on what you think of
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   the performance, which is not necessarily zippy.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   No.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.720]   But essentially you, you control page turns and you control other things by touching the
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.400]   screen down below the screen up above is like the Kindle.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:59.560]   It's a static or non touch screen, e ink display.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.000]   And so if you have, if you have the ability to kind of control it down here, it's, the
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.120]   theory is a little more friendly.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.120]   I don't know.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   I haven't let's read the details of the, exactly the details of the Microsoft patent.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.720]   But obviously, you know, they could come to, they could come to Barnes and Noble and say,
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.120]   Hey, you know, there's two patents actually.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.360]   There's a, there's a Microsoft dual display patent that they filed.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:30.160]   We reported on June 30th and then Amazon was granted a patent for a dual screen ebook
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   reader.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.760]   So I don't know if there's any interplay there.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.760]   I don't think there is.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.080]   I wonder if this was the reason the courier was killed because that's exactly what courier
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   was, right?
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   I don't think Mike.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.720]   I think the courier was killed because Microsoft couldn't get it together.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.240]   I don't think they weren't like, Hey, Amazon might do.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   Oh my God.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.480]   The companion.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.160]   I think that it was, that was purely, that was a hundred percent Microsoft if they killed
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.440]   the courier.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.320]   And, you know, these dual display devices, I mean, actually the note, you know, you mentioned
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   the performance.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.360]   I noticed with the update, the performance is a lot better, but I still think it's sort
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.560]   of a failed experience to have that little display down below and then the display up
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   top.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.240]   And we've seen other devices, the, the edge, something called the entourage edge, which
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.040]   has two screens.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.440]   One is LCD and one is e-ink, also kind of an uneven experience.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:23.360]   I think like anything, what really makes this stuff work is a great user interface and a
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   great user experience.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.520]   And a lot of these companies forget in the excitement of, Hey, we can put two screens
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.600]   on this thing.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:35.440]   They forget we also need to make an experience for the user really great.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.760]   So, so there, that's all there is to say about that.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.080]   Everybody's just like, I did not know you said the definitive final words, the final
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.080]   word.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.080]   There was nothing more to say.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.080]   Sorry.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.880]   Well, actually I have one question for Joshua.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   Okay.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.240]   To beat this dead horse.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.520]   Have you played with the Sony touchscreen reader?
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.120]   I haven't played with that.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.120]   What is that?
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.120]   No, I haven't.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   I have not played around with it.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:09.000]   I did play with the, what is this, the, the Q reader, which is the, it's not out yet,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.520]   but has a touchscreen overlaid on expensive.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.400]   Yeah, the plastic logic.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.400]   It's great.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.560]   I mean, the U.I. is actually really beautiful and it's elegant.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:26.440]   It's just, you know, the response time of eating is painful to, to experience.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:32.920]   So being search shares up 7% in June, Google down 1%.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.840]   Now 1% doesn't sound like much, but I was told at one point, I think Jason Calicana has
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.040]   told me that 1% of search is worth like a billion dollars.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   So it's a significant shift.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.360]   If it is, you have a $90 billion, you probably won't miss one.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.000]   What's one?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.800]   You have 99 billion dollars.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:58.160]   What I can't work out is if Google lost one, a Microsoft gain seven, who lost six.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   Altavista.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   Altavista.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   Ask.com.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160]   I don't know.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   Ask, ask Jeeves.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   Ask Jeeves.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.160]   You're a Jeeves.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.600]   I think, well, I wish we had more search competition.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   You're right.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   We need it.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:17.080]   We're going to see it because I think that the, I think Google knows this very well, that
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:23.000]   the idea of searching an index of pages is not what people want is rapidly becoming
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.680]   obvious, which is why Google's adding real-time search, why they bought this, what is it,
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.400]   IAT, the airline guide, because people don't just want search.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.920]   This is why I think my Bing might be gaining some traction.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.320]   The whole premise of Bing was, hey, it's not just search will help you buy tickets.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   It will help you find the right flight.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.880]   When Google's now started to say, yeah, if you do a Google search where you say, I have
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.920]   seven hours and $1,000 to spend where can I go, we'll be able to give you the answer
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   now.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   Like somebody would actually search for that.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   I don't know who would want.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   Don't do that.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.520]   You're not like, I just, I got an hour, $1,000 where am I going to be telling you where to
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.520]   go Google.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.040]   But isn't the truth we're getting past, I mean, the kind of search that Google is so
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.480]   good at to something else?
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.240]   I don't know what, but.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:11.600]   I think there's a lot of people who are saying that the idea of search being trawling lots
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.280]   of information that you have kind of no stake in or no interested in.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.680]   That's what those crazy is kind of done.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.120]   Have you seen the new searches is effectively recommendation?
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.880]   I mean, if you want to search for a great restaurant to go to dinner, do you want to
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.920]   search Google or do you want to ask all your friends on Facebook?
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   Have you seen it?
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.960]   They probably haven't seen these in Britain, these Microsoft Bing commercials.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   Have you seen those?
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.440]   Oh, the decision thing, where all the people go crazy.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   They're crazy.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.560]   It's they call it a search overload syndrome and they're, they, they grab you because they're
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.600]   so bizarre at first here.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.480]   I'll play one of them just to give you since you're stuck in the great, in the great UK
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.440]   where you can't see these fine commercials.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.840]   I think these do air really need to find a new place for breakfast.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.680]   The breakfast club in 1986 called classic star and members of the brand pack.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.680]   What?
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   Do you want an LCD of plasma?
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.320]   Plasma's an eye and eyes gas.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.480]   Next time we got to find cheaper tickets.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.480]   Chief skates.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.480]   Chief Rills.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.080]   I'm having this backpacking backpacking back to school.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.240]   You'll hunt a bastion back.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.280]   Seriously, we need a new place to eat.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.120]   These people seem like stepford wives.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.600]   They seem so strange.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   They're a big resource.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.200]   They're turning us all into infused robots.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   Robots.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   Artificial intelligence.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   Machines.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   I am robot.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   I mean, you think you do.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.520]   Don't you feel like Google search has gotten?
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.880]   There's so much noise.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   Why is it bad, Joe?
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.880]   What's wrong with it?
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   It's too much noise?
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   There's so much noise on the internet.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.600]   I mean, here's what the internet has now become, right?
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.680]   It just feels like to me when I search for something, it isn't like, "Hey, I went and
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.840]   found this thing that I needed."
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:51.800]   It's, "Let me sift through this enormous amount of noise to try to find the one piece of usable
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.080]   data that I really wanted to get at."
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.160]   I mean, I feel like the state of search, the whole SEO race has destroyed.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.280]   It's destroyed our ability to find and use real information.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:09.920]   I think that we have a flood of scraper sites, a flood of associated contents with millions
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.920]   of articles.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.440]   The other day I was looking for something, I found an article that was a review of deodorant.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.760]   It was literally a thousand word human.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.000]   A human being wrote a review of $4 tube of men's deodorant.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.800]   What were you searching for, Joshua?
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   I was searching for deodorant reviews.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.960]   I was searching for I was searching for a lot of all free deodorant or something.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.720]   But the fact of the matter is that there's...
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.880]   But no, wait a minute, Joshua.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.280]   That's the strength of the internet.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   If you happen to be looking for a review of deodorant, somebody's written in.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.600]   I was saying I wasn't actually looking for a review of deodorant.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.280]   So, something else that just happened across this thing and I said, "I got to see this."
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.480]   He was like, "Javon, must deodorant review."
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.680]   It's probably demand media, right?
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   Something like that.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   It was associated content.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   There you go.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   That's the company I know.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   The whole...
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:02.360]   This desire for everybody to make money off of search results has really polluted our search
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.360]   results.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.360]   It really is.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.000]   It's another way to spam people.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.240]   If you don't get the spam email for Viagra, you get the spam search results for Viagra.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   So it's like...
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   I don't know.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.240]   I think there's a real problem.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   I'm not saying being solves the problem.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.720]   They may just be adding a problem.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:24.200]   Well, I think this is why Facebook has attributed to it so much value because the potential
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.760]   is that you can start to get all the information that you want.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.560]   You can get your deodorant reviews, but you can get it from trusted sources within your
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.560]   social network.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.600]   You don't have to go outside of that network to people that you don't know or don't want
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.000]   to know or to spam us to get that kind of thing.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.800]   I mean, that's why ultimately people think Facebook is...
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.960]   Well, why Google is so worried about Facebook because as Facebook gets bigger and as your
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:53.200]   social circle gets bigger, potentially there's no 90% of questions that you're going to want
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.960]   to know can be answered by someone in your social network without having to ever go to
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   Google potentially.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:04.480]   You know, we had Nicholas Negroponte on The End Gadget Show and he had written previously
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:09.240]   about 15 years ago about this system of looking at news and you would have a little slider
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.040]   that you'd be able to go to the left and to the right depending on what news you were
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.160]   going to see if it was conservative or liberal.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.960]   You would literally slide this thing.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.360]   And I said, "Who's going to be the editor of that?
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.320]   Who would be the person in your approach?"
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.720]   And he said, "Now, this is exactly what we're talking about.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.880]   Now that person is your friends, your circle of trusted people who you're getting your
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.040]   DNA through their picks."
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.760]   I think that's very powerful.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.000]   I think it is as well.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.760]   I mean, it's certainly better than a robot.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.480]   I think an algorithm can't figure everything out.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.680]   In an algorithm, you have to get to a point where you say, "It's like, didn't we just
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.440]   hear about Google News starting to use human editors to sort through or...?
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.800]   There was tech meme that changed to a human editors, I think it was.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.120]   Google News is doing it too.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.120]   Are they really?
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.120]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.800]   So I think what people are finding out is that when it comes to things that are really
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:04.400]   important, like medical information or news or things where you really need to get or
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.680]   even less important, like a restaurant review or something, now there's so much out there,
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.400]   so much content, it isn't enough to just say, "Well, it'll all the good stuff will bubble
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.440]   to the top, the bad stuff will bubble down to the bottom," because you can game it.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.720]   If you can game it, then you end up with bad information.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.440]   You end up with skewed results.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:29.680]   The human being is really that barrier between the game and the person on the receiving end.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.960]   Well, that's what people like Matt Cutz, who works at Google Fighting Spam.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:41.000]   Google has many, many people working on exactly that, trying to sift out the SEO.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.560]   Yeah, the trouble is people define as spam is different.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:50.040]   Josh is saying this really kind of cruddy content from content machines like associated
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:55.960]   content is basically the modern equivalent of all the search equivalent of spam.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.160]   And for Google, that's a legitimate business that feeds money back to them via AdWords.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.840]   So who defines what spam is in that sense?
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.280]   Okay, that's why your social graph is so useful here because your friends presumably
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.760]   know what spam is.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.360]   That's why I think Kevin's doing dig four.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   I think that's the whole idea of dig four is you find the news that your friends tell
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   you about.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   He's a little late to the game though.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.960]   This is why people love Twitter, isn't it?
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.200]   And I guess why they pay attention to Facebook.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:28.000]   And this is also why Google is reportedly working on its own social network that will
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.640]   obviously incorporate its own search.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   And once you apply Google's search, which works well when it finds what you're really
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:45.560]   looking for to a social network like it that it would run itself with your trusted sources.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.240]   That could be pretty powerful.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.320]   And I think Facebook probably should be a little nervous about that.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.800]   We're going to get to go ahead, Joshua.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.720]   Just a second, we're going to take a break.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.120]   So go ahead and final words on this.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.840]   I was just going to say that we seem to have decided actually, I don't know who decided
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:06.160]   this, that making money off of ads was the only way to make the internet profitable for
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   businesses.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.960]   And we have just sort of locked into that idea.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.280]   You know, Jaren Lanier wrote a book called You Are Not A Gadget, which touches on this
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.280]   quite a bit.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   I don't know if you've read it.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:20.480]   But the idea that we are just have decided advertising is the only way to make money off
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.720]   of our content online.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.680]   And of course, I speak as a person who makes money off of advertising.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.640]   That's what end gadget does.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.440]   But I think we need to explore some of those other ideas about ways you can, you know,
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.800]   because you don't want to get into that cycle of spam basically because it's easy to gain
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.800]   that ad system.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.760]   We're going to take a break and come back with more.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.280]   Actually, Google has made a move apparently that is going to help it with this imaginary
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:53.080]   Facebook clone by going directly to one of Facebook's biggest contributors and investing
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   in it.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.680]   We'll talk about that in just a second before we do though.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.640]   I want to mention our friends at Citrix, the creators of the great go to assist and
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.400]   go to assist express.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.760]   Go to assist express is something that we started using in this.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:10.040]   Let's see, I guess 10 years ago, almost on the screen savers to help people with their
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.680]   computer problems would be able to get into their computers and fix it.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.360]   Well, it's better and easier and more effective than ever before.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.000]   Faster to the new go to assist express.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.960]   You could try it free at go to assist.com slash to it.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.520]   Here's the idea, you know, whether it's a family member or you're in an IT department,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.000]   you've got to support your users or maybe you have some software you support.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.520]   You got somebody with a problem there across country.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.520]   They're around the world.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.840]   Maybe they're just even down the hall, but you don't want to get up from your desk.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.000]   You want to solve the problem, not on the phone, but by reaching into their computer
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   and fixing it.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.640]   That's what go to assist express is so good at.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.760]   They don't even have to have the software installed.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.880]   Just tell them go to go to assist express.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.880]   Here's the code and they enter it in 20 seconds later.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.200]   You're in their system fixing it or you can send them a link.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.760]   But the first step is for you to install it free for 30 days.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.440]   Go to assist.com slash to it up to eight sessions at once.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.640]   Sessions can be unattended if your users let you do that.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.800]   You get a complete assay of what software is running on their system security software,
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.440]   operating systems, background software.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.360]   You can drag and drop files from one computer your computer to theirs.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.760]   So if you've got a patch or install, you can just move it over.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.880]   That's where those eight systems, eight sessions at once really come in handy because you've
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:29.840]   got an install going on one, you don't have to sit around waiting, playing the doom.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.440]   Does anybody still play doom?
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.440]   You can.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.440]   You can.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.440]   No.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.200]   Only our sys admin.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.040]   You can go to the second one or the third one or the fourth one update sessions at the
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   same time.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.320]   I use it with my family.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   It's so great.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.160]   They do have day passes if you don't do assist, you know, support all the time.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.560]   But if you are a regular support professional, you're going to want to get the monthly very,
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.400]   very effective, very affordable.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.160]   You're 28-bit encrypted so they can use it in an open access spot without fear.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.280]   24/7 support for you.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.480]   Go to assist.com/twit.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.280]   Give it a try.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   Absolutely free for 30 days.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.080]   It's just fantastic.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.240]   So TechCrunch had this story and you know, I always a little suspicious when I first
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:17.640]   see TechCrunch, but then the venture beat confirmed it that Google has put $100 million
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.600]   into Zinga.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.080]   The creators of Farmville and Mafia Wars, Zinga has apparently raised half a billion this
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.440]   year, which sounds like a lot until you realize they're well on their way to making a billion
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:38.120]   dollars a year selling bits to people who are farming in big air quotes on their Facebook
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.640]   page.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.760]   I guess it's a good investment.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.920]   It wasn't the venture arm though.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.600]   It was Google itself that put $100 million into Zinga.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.840]   I guess it's a good investment, but it does sound like they're preparing the launch of
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.840]   Google Me.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:56.520]   And in fact, this rumor might even be that they're, and this is what Games Beat said,
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.720]   that they're going to do a Google Games as part of this new social platform.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.680]   Does that make sense, Dwight?
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.040]   Oh, Dwight, I can't hear a thing you're saying.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.200]   Unmute your theft.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:16.160]   If you, I think it does, if you have a, if you look at how addictive all these games
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.720]   are, everything from Farmville and the various games that are on Facebook.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.600]   Poker, Mafia Wars, poker, Mafia Wars, all this.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.240]   I think that casual gaming, as much as art games.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.720]   But this is more than casual gaming.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.080]   This is virtual goods.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.560]   Virtual goods and really addictive gameplay.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.600]   And I don't think in essay has to be virtual goods.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.480]   My wife is a serious words with friends at it.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.480]   Me too.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.800]   I got seven games going now.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   Right.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:51.320]   And what was funny was we would go out to dinner and she'd, you know, give me grief
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.920]   for looking at my email.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.160]   And now I get to give her grief for her playing versus playing.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.600]   Stop playing Scrabble.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.800]   But the addictive nature of this, you can, Google has already said that, and to get back
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.880]   to our first discussion of the night, Google has already said that everything is going
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.920]   to be mobile first.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   And so I would not be surprised if you don't see this launch with a mobile platform as
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.920]   well as that platform.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:23.000]   Well, I was going to say this seems like it would tie into, I mean, potentially if there
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.520]   is this Google games thing, there's going to be, if Chrome OS exists eventually, which
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.560]   they say it's going to, there's going to be an application store for it.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.480]   Or in their case, it's not really an application store because everything is web based.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   The website store.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.920]   It's like something like Farmville makes perfect sense because it is online.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.600]   You know, it's something you play inside of a browser for the most part.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.800]   I just understand where people are finding all the, maybe it's just me, who has time
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.040]   to play these games or so many people playing them?
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.800]   But that's the strength of it, Joshua.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.120]   It takes a second hero there.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.360]   It's not like you're playing a very long elaborate game.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   If you've got--
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.360]   I'm going to get those seconds.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.520]   Well, you're working too hard.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.520]   Stop working so hard.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.840]   No, you can always, you know, there's always a time when you're sitting waiting for a phone
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.480]   call or you're in line somewhere where you can play a quick game of Scrabble.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.760]   You know, not game, quick move in Scrabble.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.080]   You know, I mean, you're sitting here, you're looking at your board and you say, "Oh, I've
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.520]   got to make a move."
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.080]   And I think these are very compelling.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.160]   I play a number of these casual games and there's something about playing it socially
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.760]   that really makes it fun.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   I can--
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.480]   Just my question about people keep saying Google meet.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.000]   That's what their social service is going to be called their social networking.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Supposedly, yeah.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Google, what about Orchid?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   What happened to that?
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Have you used Orchid?
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.760]   It's still part of their, you know, offerings.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   I'm just saying.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.760]   I tried, you know, when I get Brazil.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.600]   When I quit Facebook, I said, "Hey, everybody, let's go to Orchid."
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.560]   And I went there and I went, "Oh, never mind."
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.360]   Yeah, it's just not a great experience.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.320]   My experience.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:55.880]   The other thing to keep in mind is that Apple has announced it as part of iOS 4.0 and showed
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:03.000]   up yet this gaming central feature that will let you find other players online.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.720]   I suspect that Google is so intensely competitive with Apple right now that many of you guys
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.520]   may be a part of this as well.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.960]   Here's why it would allow them to do that on Android so that it stays competitive with
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.960]   iOS.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.240]   This is making me, this is depressing to me just looking at this.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.240]   Yeah, this is my Orchid page.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   What do you update?
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.840]   Is this your update on your status?
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.840]   Yeah, there's my status.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   Look at that.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   There's the wall.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.840]   Wow.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   You know, it doesn't look buzz.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.480]   It's just like looking at this is the beta for Google meet.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.480]   Yeah, my piece.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.120]   I mean, you use Leo, you're a buzz user, right?
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   I love buzz, yeah.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   I mean, buzz is to me.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.640]   Is it not a failed Google experiment?
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.040]   I mean, I disagree.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.040]   I don't think so.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.960]   I mean, what is what is first of all, what is Google need for it to be a success?
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.120]   People need to use it more than Twitter.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.680]   That's not going to happen.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   Or instead of Twitter.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.680]   How about that?
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.400]   See, I don't think Google, I think that's the question.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.360]   Does Google me have to be used more than Facebook to succeed?
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.360]   No.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.680]   I think it just does Google Docs have to be Microsoft Office to succeed?
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.600]   That's surely the point of Google me is exactly that it needs to be not necessarily
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.120]   more popular, but the default social platform in order, you know, if we all sort of agree
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.680]   that search is going more social and social recommendation than for Google to stay the
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.560]   leader in search, it needs to become the leader in social.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.640]   Well, that's it.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.760]   That's a tough road, Oh, I agree with that.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   I think if you're going to make a play for that space, if you're going to go to say we're
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.520]   going to start a social networking service, I don't think you're doing it to be complimentary
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.520]   to Facebook.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.520]   I mean, I highly doubt it.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:37.320]   I mean, Google has to go all in and get that demographic over to their service because
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   it's easier.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.320]   It's more integrated.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.520]   It's more fun.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.520]   I don't know.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.840]   But I think that if you get a you have to play to win in that space, I don't see any
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.080]   other way to do, you know, just like a light social networking light for Google doesn't
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.040]   make a lot of sense to me.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.880]   What do you make of the reports that Eric Schmidt and Mark Zuckerberg had a little private
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.920]   tetta, tat at the ou.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.840]   Was that before after Mark was served to really awkward people?
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.160]   Yeah, really talking.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.720]   I would love to see the awkward coverage.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.320]   I would love to see the body language analysis of that one.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   I don't know.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.000]   What were they supposed to have spoken about?
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.480]   Just like Eric was like, I'm going to take you down.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.800]   No, you know, I've been.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.200]   They went off for when you get people.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:28.360]   Yeah, when you get these big shots together, they just talk about BS has the wife has the
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   kids, you know, they don't.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.360]   What are they going to say?
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.960]   And they're and they'll dance around the fact, but they're in there, you know, they they
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.760]   don't compete face to face.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   They're not competing face.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:43.680]   They're not going to really think that that at the the fabled Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt,
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.120]   a Starbucks meeting that they talked about the wife and kid, they didn't talk about
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   nothing.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.960]   That was a that was a photo op photo.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.240]   I was a total PR move.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.480]   I don't think that's true.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   Of course it was.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.480]   I don't know.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.720]   They were actually they just went out to their regular coffee place.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.200]   They were all like waiting for people to show up, get some pictures.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.640]   They went back inside.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.200]   And what does job?
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   What do he say?
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   They're going to see it anyway.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   So they might as well.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.040]   So we really mysterious like which by the way, still makes no sense.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.400]   Yeah, or maybe it does.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.280]   We don't have any proof that ever staged, though, do we?
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   No, but I think it was pretty clearly staged, don't you think?
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.800]   It's just a weird why.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   Why?
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   Do you know why they stay?
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.760]   Yes, I'll tell you why, because there's been all of this ink going on about how Apple
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.840]   and Google are at loggerheads.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.000]   And that's not good for either company internally to start thinking there's this rivalry.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   We got to get Apple.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   We got to get Google.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.760]   Work for Microsoft and Lotus.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.720]   Well, no, with that.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:48.040]   I mean, the whole rivalry, the Apple, you know, the Apple when Microsoft rivalry was
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:53.080]   effective in for both of them actually, when you think about it, and really you see Apple
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.840]   kind of reaping the benefits of that fanaticism now.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.240]   I think a certain amount of that is good.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.080]   And clearly Steve thought so too, because when he spoke to that all hands meeting, he
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.640]   did kind of rev up the rhetoric.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:08.960]   I think what happened was right after that, he thought, let's get a little out of hand.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.520]   Let's look a little more collegial.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.320]   Eric used to be on our board.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.400]   We do still use a lot of Google stuff on our phones.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.240]   What about the Bing move?
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.840]   That's a gauntlet thrown down there, if you ask me.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.840]   Well, did it happen?
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.840]   I mean, is it?
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.840]   Yeah, Bing is in option.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.640]   It's not the default, if it were the stuff.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.000]   But when you go to Bing, when you go to Bing on the iPhone, and this happens on Yahoo as
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.520]   well, when you go to Bing on the iPhone, and you do a search there, when you complete the
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.120]   search, it says, do you want to make Bing your default on the iPhone?
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.960]   Yahoo has been doing that for a while, but this is the first time that Bing has done that.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.000]   I mean, the fact that it's on there at all, I mean, this is Microsoft we're talking about,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.160]   and this is the enemy, right?
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.320]   I mean, if there's an enemy here, really, I know they've collaborated in blah, blah,
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.320]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.320]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   I think it's interesting that they put Bing on there, that they went that far.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   I mean, it's not essential, Bing is an essential to the life of the Internet right now, but jobs thought there was some good reason.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   I feel like that was a sign, that was a signal to kind of a signal to Google to say, you know, look, we don't need you.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.320]   Businesses and nations need enemies.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   We don't know. Yes, that's true, but we don't really know. It may be that Microsoft said,
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   well, we'll give you a check for $500 million if you put it on there.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.320]   We don't get Steve Jobs needs the money.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.320]   I don't think Steve's the kind of guy that's going to walk away from money.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   How much cash do they have on hand is something ridiculous?
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   30 or 40 billion or something like that.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.320]   They just need to buy a few other companies in cash, that's no problem.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.320]   All right, so is Google really going to do a Google me,
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   and do they have a shot at taking on Facebook?
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   Is it going to be done wave style, buzz and wave style?
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   Okay, waves of flop. I think we can all agree that.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   I think Buzz has, you know, here's the thing.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:19.320]   I think Google has some aces up its sleeve that it hasn't played yet that aren't going to be much use much longer,
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   so they're going to have to play them pretty soon. They have to do with search.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:27.320]   For instance, Google me will be clearly tied to Google profiles as Buzz is tied to Gmail.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:31.320]   I think you can tie them all together if you use your search kind of creatively.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.320]   For instance, if you make sure that if you search for Joshua Topolsky,
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:39.320]   what shows up at the top of the search is his buzz profile,
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:44.320]   his profile by the profiles of Buzz are the same tab of one page.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.320]   And then maybe there's a me tab.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   If that's the first thing you find when you search for Joshua Topolsky,
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   doesn't that suddenly become a very powerful platform?
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:59.320]   What if Joshua Topolsky, who is your friend, has already searched for something similar,
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:04.320]   found what he's looking for and favorited those, and then you come back and see them?
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   That's built in. They already do have that feature.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.320]   Right. So the other thing, you know, the thing about Buzz is Buzz is a new friend feed.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:16.320]   It looks like friend feed. It acts like friend feed, which ironically was bought by Facebook.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:21.320]   I know. And by the way, I use it instead of friend feed now to do the same things I was doing with friend feed.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   Right. So I really think, and somebody record this, put it on the Internet.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.320]   That's being recorded. I hope so.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   That this is a mobile play and that Facebook has, you know, limited stuff with mobile.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   Google is going to do a serious mobile social network.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   The only thing really that Buzz is, the reason you would say Buzz is a failure right now is because they were slow to come out with a third party API.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.320]   It's still fairly new. So remember, it took Twitter a year before anybody even heard of it.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   I think there's an intrinsic problem with Buzz that they, right out of the gate, I really wish had not occurred.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   I mean, which is the connection to your Gmail account.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.320]   I mean, first, I'm going to use a stake there. It's my main email. I use a hosted Gmail account.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.320]   So I don't automatically don't have Buzz in the place where I really live in terms of email.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.320]   Second, it is attached to a profile that I don't want it to be attached to.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.320]   It's part of a system that I don't want it to be a part of.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.320]   Now, if Google me existed and you said Google me and Buzz are companion products, they live together.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   They don't live inside your email. They don't live, you know, in your analytics or whatever other Google services you're using.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.320]   I think their biggest mistake here was not saying, this is a standalone product.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:46.320]   We're going to use our resources. You can connect it to your email account if you want.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   But it's a standalone product. You can have a separate account here.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:57.320]   I mean, one of the big things that Google's doing now that I find rather annoying is the desire to connect each part of your Google experience with the same account.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   So now when I log into YouTube, for instance, it wants me to connect YouTube to my Gmail account to another account so that I can log in with that.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   And that is not necessarily something that I want or need to do.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:20.320]   And I feel like the idea of the unified login, the one login for everything is not only dangerous, but it's actually a little bit annoying when it comes to separating the different parts of your life.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   You know, I may want to use personal projects. I don't want it to be connected to my work email.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:30.320]   I may want to use Buzz for talking to my friends and I don't want that connected to my work email.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:42.320]   I mean, there's just, I think there's just a lot of problems with their premise. The idea that you want these things to live together, the Buzz living inside of my inbox is actually awful.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   I mean, I think it's an awful idea.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:58.320]   Well, I mean, that's really interesting because I think what they're trying to do in that sense is build, you know, what I feel is kind of like the 70% use case scenario where probably you are, you know, in a sort of 30% band
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:09.320]   where you're sort of hardcore power users, you've got a hosted Gmail thing, your own Gmail thing, you've got different profiles, you know, probably uploading stuff to multiple YouTubers, all this kind of thing.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   And the unified login is a nightmare because actually for you to be able to distinguish all these separate parts of your online life is really crucial.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:34.320]   For most people, the ability to just sign into anything using the same Gmail or Facebook account, whether it's Amazon or Netflix or anything like that, a unified login would just be like a massive hassle saver.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.320]   And so I think what Google is trying to do is build sort of a security risk.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:47.320]   It's a tough position for Google because they do, they want to leverage what they've got, but you're right.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.320]   That's Joshua.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.320]   That's going to piss off people.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   I mean, don't get me wrong.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   I like the idea of being able to log in in a lot of places with one thing.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.320]   I'm not saying that the premise of that is a bad idea.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.320]   I'm saying I wasn't given a choice when it came to buzz.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.320]   If I could log in.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.320]   I think you're right.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   I think they made a mistake.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   I think they made a mistake.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.320]   Yeah, they made a mistake.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.320]   Give me the choice and then I'll decide after it.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   You know, it's like, I think Steve talked about this at D8 and obviously was a big conversation there about the opt in or opt out.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.320]   It's like, don't make it opt out.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.320]   Make it opt in.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.320]   Give me the power to start with and then go from there.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:27.320]   I think it's frustrating when you have a company like Google, which has so much access to so much of your personal information.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.320]   And I'm not a big paranoid guy.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   Like, I'm not worried about what they have access to for the most part.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:36.320]   I don't think they really are going to abuse it because look, their motto is don't be evil.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   So how could they possibly be evil?
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   No, I just think, but I think that you got to give people the choice first and then let them make the decision.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:53:01.320]   Do you think they have learned lessons that they'll apply to Google me or, you know, is the temptation to use kind of the expansive nature of what they've got already such that they will do that make that same mistake again?
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   I mean, it's very tempting, you know, to pull together everything.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.320]   It was a real mess.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   I mean, they really got some flack for what they did with Buzz.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.320]   They have to have gotten it that, you know, this is not the right way to proceed.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.320]   You know, with Google, it's weird.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.320]   I feel like a lot of times the stuff they do isn't because they're trying to be evil or malicious.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.320]   It's because they have this mentality where they're just, they say, you'll just do it.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.320]   Let's try this out.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.320]   This seems like a good idea.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.320]   We'll see if it works or not.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.320]   Everything's very beta.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.320]   It's a beta mentality, you know, they're sort of tweaking and changing and experimenting.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.320]   And they probably thought they made this decision fairly in a fairly arbitrary way.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   They probably somebody probably said, hey, this makes sense to me.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Let's do it like that.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.320]   And a few other people said, okay, we agree.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.320]   I'm not sure that they had it.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.320]   I mean, maybe they had a strategy, but somebody, I don't, if I feel like if somebody had known
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:52.320]   this was a potential that the backlash would be so strong, they wouldn't have done it.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   Yeah, I think they should have done it better.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.320]   Yeah, maybe, but you know, we assume they're perfect.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.320]   They're not perfect.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   They're just a company.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.320]   They're very into the air.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   And that's very into the air.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.320]   They're not normal humans.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.320]   Go ahead.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.320]   Go ahead.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.320]   Well, like you also sort of assume that these people have got sort of all these experiences before.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:16.320]   I mean, the idea of, you know, the massive amount of privacy needed in the online world is really
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   only come around in the last, you know, couple of years as things have gotten more personal
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   and more privacy invading.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.320]   I don't think there's really a sort of an offline precedent beyond sort of, you know, your
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   government papers or your hospital records or something where you're so keen to do something
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   in what is, you know, effectively a public forum, but still maintain your privacy.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:41.320]   And I think that, although in many ways, you know, the, the, the pro, you know, what the
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.320]   rules should be are relatively obvious.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.320]   I think there are many cases where it's just not that obvious and people are making mistakes
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.320]   because nobody's done this before.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.320]   You know what's interesting?
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:57.320]   Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, all of the big players, the four horsemen of the Internet,
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   if you want to use John Doers' terms, have made some pretty big blunders of late.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   See, all of them kind of stumbling.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.320]   It isn't.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   Those are moving so fast.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.320]   Yeah, it's not an easy thing to do and it's not immediately apparent what people really
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   want.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   And I'm sure Facebook thought that it acted in good faith to do exactly what people were
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   looking for and was probably a little shocked when the response was so negative.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:29.320]   I'm sure Google didn't plan for buzz to be such a hot button for people.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:34.320]   Is this a case of geeks and, um, and millennials?
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   Is this a situation where, well, that might be true too.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.320]   That the market's very fragmented.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.320]   There is no one user.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:44.320]   There is no one user and that, um, and that the people who are developing these things
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   are younger.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:48.320]   Um, they are, um, they're engineers.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:53.320]   You know, one of the, I hear from people who work in the design areas at Google who, uh,
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   express frustration privately about the idea of everything being engineering driven and
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:03.320]   that, uh, you know, UI doesn't get much of a feel and possibly even just simple rules of
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:07.320]   etiquette don't, don't get much of a hearing in Google's products.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:13.320]   And so I think if you look at kind of, um, the engineering mentality, kind of a younger
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.320]   group of people for whom, you know, what do I have to hide?
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.320]   I'm, I, I, you know, privacy is not that big of an issue for me.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:24.320]   Uh, and then you put it out there and the masses get it and they go, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.320]   Hold on.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.320]   And, uh, and I think that, that that may be the case.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   I think people, I think maybe they need a more diversity of development and design.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.320]   And culture design.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   They do suffer on the design side design is where Apple is so good at design.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.320]   Google is so bad at design.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   I mean, there's such engineers when it comes to even their logo.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:50.320]   I've always thought that Google logo just is so, so not designed at all.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.320]   You know, it's like somebody came up with it one day.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.320]   They're like, we need a logo for this thing.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.320]   Just have Joe, you know, put it together.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.320]   Just keep the clean man.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.320]   Just keep the simple.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   Make it simple, whatever, you know, they arbitrarily picked a few colors.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.320]   I think you're right.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:08.320]   I do feel like they have this design thing where it's, um, it's not even about, you know, it's
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.320]   not about function form following function.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.320]   It's in the computing space.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.320]   I think they have to be on the same form and function have to be on the same level.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.320]   In many ways, they're the same thing.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   Right.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   Form is function.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   Uh, it comes to how we know that.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.320]   You know that Apple, they know that I sure do.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.320]   And it, and it, and it sings in their products.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:33.120]   You can see in the iPhone, you look at the iPhone OS from start to finish as an, is an
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.320]   experience that is fluid and natural and feels complete.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:42.720]   And you look at Android, I mean, it's taken a year or two years just to get up to snuff,
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.320]   really, to any kind of fit and finish.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:49.680]   And it's still very, it feels disjointed, you know, and I think that they need to start
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.480]   putting an emphasis on that, if they want to move into an OS space, you know, with Chrome
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:00.640]   OS, and if they want to really convince people that Android phones are the way to move the
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.280]   path of the future, they have to convince people not just on the, on the functionality,
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.000]   which is great, but on the form as well.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.400]   You know, they remind me a little bit of Microsoft and of Windows in the, in the early decades
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:15.120]   where, uh, you have, they were in the same situation where you weren't really controlling
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.120]   the hardware.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:20.280]   They're different hardware designers putting their own spit and polish on the Microsoft
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.640]   operating system.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.400]   Microsoft was not a very good, well designed platform.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.640]   I think you could say it was fairly ugly.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:31.680]   XP comes to mind as one of the ugliest operating systems I've ever seen.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.680]   It is.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.680]   Uh, so you're too litarian.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.680]   Very, too.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:39.280]   Hey, I think XP's start menu looks a lot like the Google logo.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.280]   I mean, the colors.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.080]   So we've been here before.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.120]   And Microsoft is starting to get it.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:52.800]   And when you look at Windows seven and you look at, you know, how they got there though,
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.800]   they copied Apple.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   Right.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:58.720]   And look at like Windows phone seven, for instance, is it completely, I mean, a kind
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:02.920]   of a breathtaking, uh, uh, design departure for them.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.080]   And it's really striking.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.760]   And you know, and I think it'll work.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:10.080]   I think it'll be good, but it's like nothing that we've seen in the mobile space.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.800]   It's totally different for Microsoft.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   Well, it's a soon.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.680]   It's a, it's a, it's a, except for soon.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:19.600]   But the Zoom HD, which obviously is a, is a branch off of the main trunk of this, of
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.840]   this design language.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.520]   But you know, I think that, um, there's an old, there's an old clip of an interview
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.360]   with Steve Jobs where he's talking about Microsoft and you don't know, talking about
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.360]   right where he's talking about their, he's like, you know, they're not, they don't make
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   bad products.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.920]   He's, he's like, they just have bad taste.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:41.360]   And he's talking about, oh, yeah, wait, fonts are spaced and, and it just really specific
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:47.200]   design stuff and you know that he is feels just totally turned off by what Microsoft
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.760]   does in the design space, which is not a lot, right?
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   That back then.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.760]   This was in the late.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:56.400]   Well, that was the famous, um, you know, moment from the D conference, right?
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.200]   Where Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates from on stage.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.840]   Um, you know, they, Bill Gates was asked, what's the thing that you most wished?
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.000]   You know, you had, and he said, you know, Steve Jobs sense of taste.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   So he admitted it.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.320]   I mean, that's just, that's a, and it's an amazing.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.640]   Video and you're talking about engineering driven companies.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.520]   Wasn't Microsoft the original engineering driven company?
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.960]   I mean, absolutely.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.240]   And, and that's what Google, I mean, Google's a little different, right?
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:26.880]   They have a little, uh, I think Microsoft is very managerial, you know, they had a lot
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.080]   of hierarchy, right?
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.160]   So it had to, and you see in products like the kid and you get the impression and you
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.080]   hear all these stories, it's still that way.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.920]   It goes through all of these steps and rigorous sort of managerial levels.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.680]   Uh, Google seems to be much more like the spokes are somewhat independent.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.240]   They're sort of doing their own thing.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.840]   People are allowed to experiment and push experiments out into the world in a much freer
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.840]   way.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.200]   So you get a lot of innovation there, but there is that sort of same kind of lack of aesthetic
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.080]   that was happening at Microsoft, yeah, throughout the nineties at least.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080]   Let's take a break.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.640]   We're going to come back and talk more with our great panel, Joshua Topolsky from Engadget.com
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.800]   Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle and the tech blog there.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.720]   He also has a radio show, which I have been on in Houston, which is just awesome.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.720]   You were a great guest.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.720]   I love that.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.720]   You're wonderful.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.160]   And you just celebrated an anniversary.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   What was the anniversary?
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.600]   The show is technology bites.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:27.680]   It's on Wednesday nights on K P F T. You listen to it on the web at K P F T dot org.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.480]   Uh, it's, uh, starts about eight o'clock central time.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.080]   It was our 15th anniversary.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.080]   Amazing.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.400]   I haven't been with it 15 years.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:40.560]   I've been with them since about, uh, 2003, I think, but it has, we, we talked about the
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.880]   idea that when we first went on the air 15 years ago, uh, we were talking about windows
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:46.880]   95.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.880]   That's right.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.240]   When I first started an tech radio, windows three, oh, DOS five.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.640]   So I'll beat beat beat them by a little bit, but not much.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   A little bit.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   Yeah, not much.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:03.240]   Also, uh, Mr, our good friend, long time friend of the show will hear us from channelflip.com.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.040]   We'll get back to our conversation in just a bit.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   I hope you're enjoying it.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.680]   By the way, you can follow along on our chatroom, irc dot twit dot TV.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.040]   Uh, give us feedback.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.040]   I watch it the whole show.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.320]   I know some of our other panelists do.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.440]   Uh, so it's a good way to kind of, as you're watching live participate or watch live, we
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.880]   do the show every Sunday afternoon, three p.m. Pacific six p.m.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.880]   Eastern time.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:31.760]   2200 UTC at live dot twit dot TV, the chatroom is irc dot twit dot TV.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.280]   And we're glad to have you here.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.000]   I want to mention right now, our friends at Squarespace, we're glad to have them on board.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.760]   One of our favorite sponsors, I just got an email from, uh, Dane Atkinson over there,
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.760]   Dane and Anthony and the gang do such great work.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:52.200]   It's a, it's web hosting, but also the best content management system you've ever seen
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.760]   for not just for blogs, but for websites of all kinds.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.240]   They say it's the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.760]   If you take a look at the examples right there at squarespace.com/twit, just click that
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.040]   examples link, you'll get an idea.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.640]   There's of course blogs here, but there's also portfolios for photographers.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.640]   It's so gorgeous.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.920]   A lot of photographers like to use it businesses.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.160]   Look Don Imus just moved his page to squarespace.com and you wouldn't know what squarespace got
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.560]   that great Western look.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.840]   This is the beauty of squarespace.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.800]   You start with templates that don't look templated and then you have complete control.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.040]   You don't have to be a designer.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.880]   You just have to be able to drag and drop to modify these templates.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.960]   Although if you do know CSS and you, uh, and you are a web wizard, there's nothing you
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.320]   can't do.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.080]   Squarespace gives you the capability of doing it all, but that's just the beginning.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.640]   You can import your existing blog.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.920]   It's got importers for all the major blog platforms.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:53.880]   You can also, uh, do great, uh, post, you know, this, this iPhone app is incredible.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.160]   It's from the iPhone, uh, statistics, uh, just, it goes on and on.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160]   I want you to give it a try.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160]   Now here's the deal.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.360]   If you go to squarespace.com/twit, you can try it free for 14 days.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.560]   You don't even need a credit card.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.360]   So it's very easy to get involved.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.440]   Just give it an eye, you know, a try to see if you like it.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.440]   squarespace.com/twit.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.600]   It's built on Java and they're, they use a Java virtual server technology that gives
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.240]   you bandwidth no matter what, you know?
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.240]   They flip the switch.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.520]   If you need more bandwidth, you've got it.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.640]   Sites start at $8 a month for the massive community site with all sorts of, you know,
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:39.200]   additional features, custom audiences, unlimited editors, merely $50 a month.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.560]   And that includes the hosting and the software and everything you need.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.840]   But I'll tell you what, you're going to save 10% just by using the coupon code TWIT when
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.080]   you sign up.

[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:55.180]   If you decide to buy 10% off for life, if you use the coupon code TWIT, we really love
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.180]   them.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:59.420]   And I know you will too squarespace.com/twit.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:06.100]   We thank them so much for their support of our program of this week in tech.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.060]   This is a story from the New York Times that you posted Dwight.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.460]   And I thought was very interesting.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:22.220]   The cost of electronic gizmos may go up soon because of labor unrest in China, increasing
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:33.460]   costs in components, shortages, a big jump soon in how much these gadgets cost.
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.460]   We've been kind of living in a fool's paradise, haven't we?
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:40.060]   I mean, the cost of computing has gone down, down, down to the point where companies compare,
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:43.860]   you know, you look at Dell's earnings, they may say millions of computers, they can barely
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.580]   make any money on them.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:50.540]   Maybe it's time the cost went up to reflect the real cost of this gear.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.540]   What do you think, Joshua?
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:55.140]   You're one of the people who's dealing day in and day out with his stuff.
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:00.980]   Well, what if the quality went up with some of the stuff as well as the price?
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:06.500]   I mean, I think that it's become very easy to make things very cheap.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.820]   And I think that there's a lot of cheap stuff and I think that there's a lot of stuff made
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.820]   cheaply.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.460]   Those aren't necessarily the same thing.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:19.140]   I think there are conditions in China that we're starting to learn about really that we
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.500]   should be feeling more responsible for.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:26.500]   I think that, and I don't mean us as just in the tech community, I mean people on the
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.980]   whole, I think that you have to realize that this stuff comes from somewhere.
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.940]   It's made by somebody.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:38.620]   And if those places, if that stuff is coming from, if the practices there are bad, if the
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:43.420]   people are being abused, if they're underpaid, if they're overworked, you know, you just
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.780]   are thinking about it as a human being.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:47.700]   You have to say, "Do I feel comfortable with this?
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.420]   Is this what I want in the world?
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.060]   Do I want people to feel that way?"
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:52.540]   Maybe we are paying enough.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:56.500]   We're kind of living on the backs of workers who are being mistreated.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   Cheap labor.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.500]   Cheap labor.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:03.540]   But I think the products themselves could stand to, you know, it's hard to say this because
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:09.460]   we report on this, but what about less crap and more really good spots?
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.900]   We talked about this last week.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:15.780]   Del Soled 13 million computers with bad capacitors they knew about.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:16.780]   Right.
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:22.060]   I mean, let's get back to a point in the world where things you bought really were made
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.820]   with some level of quality and care.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:28.260]   I think the one thing you can say about Apple, and I know that they're not going to do that,
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:33.780]   that the haters will not like to hear this, but look, their stuff is, it's made better
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.780]   than other people's stuff.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.500]   I mean, you look at the devices.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.780]   I mean, you have an iPhone 4 sitting there.
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.980]   Compare that to even the highest and Android devices on the market right now.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:48.500]   And in my opinion, when it comes to build quality and materials, there is not a one-to-one
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.460]   comparison that I can find out there.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.020]   I think that's true.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:59.220]   I think Apple is very guilty of just occasionally pulling outrageous howlers and completely failing
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.380]   to admit it.
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:06.700]   The number of first-gen MacBooks with fan floors or the run desperately too hot, the
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:11.540]   recent thing with the iPhone 4, although I definitely agree that when Apple gets it right,
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.780]   there is no, they are peerless in the technology world.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:18.180]   There are some pretty serious flaws in this iPhone 4 though.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.180]   Things, yeah, right?
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.100]   My proximity sensor doesn't work properly.
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.980]   Is that an issue?
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:23.980]   This is Apple.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:24.980]   There's this quality control.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.980]   I mean, this is my question.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:30.420]   You know, I've talked to my wife, writer, and gadget as well, so we talk about this
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.420]   stuff pretty much 24/7.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.820]   And I've talked about it with the other editors.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:36.580]   And my question is, look, these things were, they sold how many?
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.300]   Two million in three days.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:43.140]   So there is a production line somewhere in China that was working at a pace.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.220]   They're probably still going at a pace that is completely insane.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.340]   And this gets right back to the heart of this question.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.140]   And Apple is talking about being guilty.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:58.180]   Apple is as guilty as anyone of not doing as much, I think, as they could about the
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:03.500]   working conditions and the way that things sort of are run in China.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.500]   But you have to imagine, some of this is quality control.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.780]   I don't believe, I have trouble believing, and I'm not defending them because I don't
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:15.540]   know that the answer yet, but I have trouble believing that Apple let this device walk
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:19.380]   out of their testing with these major flaws.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.820]   And they just said, well, it won't matter.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.100]   We'll sell a bunch of them anyhow.
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.140]   And if people complain, that's not our problem.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:29.780]   So I feel like there is a quality control issue with some of this stuff.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:33.020]   The yellow-blue dots are probably the quality control thing.
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.220]   That's a great example, right?
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:38.140]   People are complaining about these yellow screen issue.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.900]   It turns out, oh, the glue wasn't done drying because they were rushed so quickly out of
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:47.260]   these plants in China that literally the glue had not dried.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:50.340]   So I think there's a question of that, but I agree with Will.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:57.020]   I mean, there have been blunders, and they have every now and again, they've got something
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.060]   that is just kind of unbelievable.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.900]   How could you not catch this?
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:08.540]   But I do think the design and build quality, I do think it tends to be better than a lot
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.660]   of other CE companies.
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:16.300]   And I just wish that I wish there was a way that we could find for all of the companies
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.100]   to really start concentrating on, hey, what are the materials?
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.020]   How is this made?
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.100]   What's the care that's taken to put it together and not just say, oh, we can get a hard drive
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.540]   from over here and some ram from over there.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.580]   And there's these plastic cases that everybody uses.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.140]   We'll just grab those two.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:32.060]   And there's a computer.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:35.900]   I feel like it just leads to an entropic state.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.900]   And we see it.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.060]   It's sort of this lowest.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:42.900]   You get down to the lowest common denominator, the cheapest thing you can possibly make.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.500]   And the market is flooded with a lot of crap.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.980]   Of course, I might be especially sensitive to this.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.020]   Yeah, you seem more crap than the normal person.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:56.860]   We had to start doing a section called Crap Gadget, which is like the US BQ.
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:04.260]   The Sushi thing or just like the USB Rocket Launcher, just whatever kind of, that stuff
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.260]   is just sort of novel, maybe.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:08.660]   But you do get to a point where you, there's so much that people are churning out and you're
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.300]   like, why does this exist?
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.300]   This thing to adjust?
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:18.780]   Hey, by the way, just don't say your wife's name on words with friends on the air.
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:24.060]   Apparently I showed my name, look at all the new games that I've been invited to participate.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.700]   Oh, no, I won't.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.380]   You know, Apple, Apple uses the same.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:30.380]   Foxline.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.380]   It's Foxline.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:37.580]   Right, they use the same manufacturers in Asia that the people who are making the crappy
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.340]   devices do.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:45.340]   And for example, they use a lot of the same components in the MacBooks and their desk
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:46.340]   tops.
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.100]   Sony used to make the laptops.
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.100]   Right, right.
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:57.220]   And so, you know, there, why is it that Apple turns out a higher quality product using these
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:58.220]   same lines as...
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.220]   Well, I think you get the choice.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:04.700]   In fact, I bet you there's a little dial practically that you can turn and say, they
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.620]   say, okay, welcome to Foxline.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.580]   We have a website with a former.
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.620]   Move the slider.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.100]   Where do you call the crime?
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.620]   You're getting the good sign.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:17.220]   Get the guys, the more expensive guys on the blockchain line.
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.220]   Exactly.
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:20.220]   I'm sure that that's the case.
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.460]   It's hard to say how do you explain the glue then?
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.460]   Well, they were rushing.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.660]   He just hadn't dried yet.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.660]   Yeah, apparently.
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.660]   This guy should probably dead.
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.780]   Speaking of, hey, Apple's in a little bit of trouble because there's a class action lawsuit.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:37.580]   I don't know the merit of this saying that the Apple iPhone AT&T exclusive is monopolistic.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.420]   The point being, yeah, they always say, oh, you can terminate any time and go to another
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.340]   carrier, but the other carrier doesn't have the iPhone.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.700]   So in reality, do we have choice?
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.140]   Can't have a monopoly when you don't control the market.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.140]   I mean, you can't...
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:55.420]   It doesn't seem like it's a traditional monopoly, but there's a point that's not a bad point.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.900]   If you want an iPhone, you have to buy from AT&T.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:01.940]   I guess it's in a way, a measure of the success of the iPhone that they could even send.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:06.860]   But it's not like saying, like, if you want, you know, a Dell computer, you've got to go
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:07.860]   and buy it from Dell.
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:08.860]   Yeah.
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.380]   I mean, it's a very creative product, right?
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:12.380]   It's not a monopoly.
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.380]   Right.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.220]   It's similar to the case where people were saying it's a monopoly that Apple says you
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.220]   can't put OS X on other computers.
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.620]   You can't make a computer that runs OS X.
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:28.660]   And that doesn't fly because their market share is so minuscule that...
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:34.620]   I mean, if the iPhone were, I don't know, maybe 40% of all smartphones, let's say it was
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:38.380]   half of all smartphones were iPhones, I think you could make a really good case.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.380]   It's not though, is it?
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:40.380]   It's not.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:41.380]   Now, it's not even close.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.380]   I mean, it's...
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.980]   In fact, with the success of Android, now Android's close to having 100,000 apps in
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.140]   the app store.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:52.220]   They're installing, according to Google, as many as 5 million new Android installations
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.220]   a month.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.300]   That's 5 million new handsets a month.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.300]   That's huge.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.300]   They're doing very, very well.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.060]   They have real competition and Microsoft is not going to...
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.340]   It's not sitting still when Windows 7 comes out.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.500]   I mean, that could give them even more competition.
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.500]   This is a...
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.260]   You have to remember, the smartphone market is a burgeoning market.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:14.620]   It is just starting to become this huge sort of beast, you know?
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.820]   And so it's wide open.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.820]   Apple doesn't control it.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:22.500]   They happen to have what I consider to be the best product in that market right now.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.500]   They don't control it.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.060]   And you've got Android devices that are...
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.060]   So there's no...
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.260]   On the face of it, there's no merit in this lesson.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.900]   Although the FCC has...
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:35.460]   Let's look to scans at some of these exclusivity deals and not just with the iPhone.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:36.460]   Well, I think it's consuming.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:40.180]   Look, there may not be legal recourse, but as consumers, we can look at scans at it and
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.180]   say, "Come on."
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:46.100]   I think the biggest problems are the way our industry is arranged, which is you have to
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.540]   buy a phone that's locked into a carrier at all.
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:51.260]   I mean, the whole idea of that, to me, seems unfair.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.260]   There should be two separate things that happen.
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:53.740]   How many different things that happen?
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:54.740]   You should be unlocked in.
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.740]   You buy a device.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.740]   And then you choose a carrier, yeah.
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.740]   That's exactly right.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:02.580]   I mean, the fact that we don't have it set up in that manner that you have to say, "If
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.020]   you want this device, you have to go over here."
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.500]   That's why I use the Nexus 1, frankly.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500]   But you have it locked.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500]   What do you have?
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.740]   T-Mobile or AT&T bands?
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:13.740]   Right.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.340]   Because it's GSM.
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.860]   Those are the two GSM carriers in the US.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:21.260]   But I could take it to the UK and I could use it there with somebody carrier and just
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:22.260]   pop a sim chip in.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.260]   Right.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.100]   You still have to use here in the US, one of those two.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:29.620]   The problem in the US also is that we have very heterogeneous networks.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.740]   We have GSM, we have CDMA.
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:38.060]   Even the GSM, some of the 3Gs are on different frequencies from here, from different carriers
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.220]   and overseas.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:43.340]   How many company carries the iPhone in England?
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:44.340]   Is it just one?
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.340]   Is it not two?
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.340]   No, they all do.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.340]   They all do.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.340]   See?
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.340]   There's five different carriers in UK.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:51.780]   All of whom have different networks and all of whom carry the iPhone.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.780]   So what's the best network?
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:58.220]   I mean, I hate to tell you guys, your cellular network is the product of massive deregulation.
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.740]   No, no, no, it's for you.
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:01.740]   It's not.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:02.740]   I disagree.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:06.140]   I think our cellular network is the product of being at the first.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:07.140]   It's legacy.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:16.980]   It's because we had cellular one put in CDMA and then GSM came along and because it's
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:21.020]   old, we don't have the homogeneity of your system.
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:22.180]   I mean, maybe that's true.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.060]   I think a lot of it's old GSM.
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.220]   There's nobody's ever heard of CDMA over here.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:34.140]   And there's also a lot of, the government is pretty heavy on making sure that telephone
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.180]   companies give consumers good deals.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.620]   I mean, they're really heavy on it.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.620]   And so it's a big deal.
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.620]   You can get the iPhone on all five.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.060]   It's funny because this is so against with the order.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:47.180]   And there are different price plans and they'll do networks, have different price points.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:50.300]   There's some places you can get the iPhone cheaper, but you pay for more for the talk
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.300]   time.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.300]   Yes.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:57.540]   That is because we have the free market orthodoxy here that the best way to have diversity
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:00.220]   is competition and deregulate.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:05.660]   No, right, which is obviously is, it kind of gets back to what we were saying about ads
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.220]   and if it can be game, then it will be game.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:12.540]   If our deregulation can be game, then it will be game, then you can be sure it's being
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.980]   gamed right now by the carriers in this country.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:19.460]   And the fact of that is we do need every once in a while, it's not the worst thing in
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.460]   the world.
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:24.420]   If the government steps in and says, you know what, let's actually regulate this to make
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.780]   it fairer for consumers.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:26.780]   I'm not, look, I'm not saying.
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:30.420]   I'm going to get Brian Rushwood on here because he's the libertarian in the bunch and he
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:32.220]   would argue with you on that one.
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.500]   But I mean, look at the situation that you've got.
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:39.220]   You've got, you know, the free market kind of story there where it was Apple and AT&T
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:42.900]   or you've got over here, you know, the hefty regulation where you can get it on five different
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.020]   carriers at five different price points.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.780]   It's kind of, you know, QED.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:48.140]   Well, I'd rather have what you've got.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.380]   What's the best carrier of the iPhone?
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.580]   Who do you like?
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.580]   Over here?
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:55.580]   O2?
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.380]   Well, O2 with the guys that had it originally.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.940]   And so they put quite a lot of effort into their, you know, upgrading the capacity of
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.420]   their 3G network.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:08.900]   But I hear reliable reports that voter phone has actually got better 3G coverage overall.
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:13.900]   So if you're in a good O2 area, it's possibly better than a good voter phone area, but you're
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.780]   more likely to get a good voter phone area somewhere, you know, across the country.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:21.380]   And Brian, the way I would point out Joshua that we do have that situation with Android
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:25.180]   and we're talking before the show, this is a problem for Android because there's so many
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:26.460]   handsets.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:28.180]   Every carrier has an Android handset.
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:30.740]   But it's, it's, yeah, but they're different handsets.
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.820]   It isn't they haven't like the next day.
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:33.820]   But isn't that good?
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:34.820]   You got choice, but that confused.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.620]   You know, it's choice is good.
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:40.620]   What I'm saying is my dream is that you have the choice.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:41.620]   You've got the incredible.
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:42.620]   You've got the droid acts.
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:45.340]   You've got the original droid.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.260]   You've got this new Motorola charm, whatever, you've got them all, right?
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:50.260]   But they're not carrier dependent.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:51.620]   It's they're all available.
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.820]   They're all carriers or it's available as a device.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.060]   And then you get the device.
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:56.220]   You say, I've got this device now.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.220]   What carrier?
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.980]   You know why that's not going to happen?
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.500]   Because they're going to cost five to $700 each.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.500]   Right.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.500]   And this goes back to that.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:08.100]   Should we be paying more for the things that we the gadgets that we own is a phone that
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.860]   I'm going to use for a year or two years is a worth $500.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:11.860]   It isn't $500.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.300]   It's $500 plus the $2000 for the bandwidth.
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.420]   I mean, that's a really good point, right?
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.420]   Because over and this, you know, particularly late into what we were just saying, the iPhone
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:26.700]   four when it came out over here, you could either buy it, you know, for 100, 200 pounds
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:30.740]   attached to a network with a contract or you could buy it direct from Apple.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.460]   Apple sold it unlocked for any carrier that you wanted.
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:38.300]   You could just walk into any carrier, you know, retail store and just pick up a SIM card
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.420]   and put it straight in the iPhone, but they sort of for 600 pounds.
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:45.620]   But you had the choice is like, that's the real cost of these things.
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:47.620]   Well, it isn't though.
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.340]   We know the iPhone costs under $200 to make.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:54.500]   Well, yeah, but I mean, that's the, you know, I have to make a money to put on the line
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.340]   straight from Apple and just whacked any old SIM card into it.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:00.180]   The truth is that the cell phone companies make money like pirates.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:03.660]   How much is $100 a month times two year contract?
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.660]   How about a text message?
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:05.660]   Forget about that.
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.540]   They charge $20 per $100 a megabyte.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.940]   They charge 25 cents for a text message.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.620]   Yes, it's $1,500 per megabyte.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:19.180]   But the band with text messages used are like a rounding error in terms of the overall bandwidth
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.820]   that these networks have.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.740]   I mean, that it is criminal, criminal to me that they can charge 25 cents.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:29.420]   I mean, the fact that we don't rise up with like the chorps and well, well, that's what
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:34.180]   everybody has a, has a group or a bulk text messaging here.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:36.180]   You pay one for a thousand.
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:37.900]   That's a rip off to.
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:39.900]   That's unlimited.
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.940]   I've got, I've got for our whole family $30 from limited.
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:44.620]   You know what the bottom line is?
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.940]   We got it because we put up with it.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:47.940]   Right.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:48.940]   Right.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:49.940]   That's right.
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:50.940]   Hey, Will, I have a question for you.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:51.940]   You got to rise up.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:55.940]   I have a question for you about the iPhone and O2 when, you know, everybody is predicting
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:21:04.460]   that when AT&T loses its exclusivity and let's say the iPhone goes to Verizon, that
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.940]   there will be a large churn at AT&T as people drop away as move over.
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.300]   Did that happen with O2?
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.300]   You know what?
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.300]   Not massively.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:18.940]   I don't know the data, but anecdotally, I think what, you know, most people who were
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:23.380]   the early adopters of the iPhone have kind of stayed with O2.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:27.540]   I think that from my understanding, most of the people who have picked up the iPhone on
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:33.180]   different networks have gone there because they were on that network already or their
[01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.180]   new users.
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:39.380]   So I think O2 hasn't seen a massive amount of people suddenly leave O2 and go to a different
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:45.380]   network because, you know, frankly, there isn't a vast amount of differentiation between
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:48.260]   the networks at all in the UK.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:52.700]   They all have, you know, within a stone's throat, you know, the same kind of coverage
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:57.180]   and the same kind of data speeds and the same kind of, you know, price plans, which
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:01.420]   I guess is, you know, the competition of having these five guys keeps all the prices down.
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.380]   They're constantly, you know, coming up with better deals.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.580]   So I don't think O2 has lost massive amounts of people.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.780]   What carrier has the best overall coverage?
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:13.780]   If I was in Europe and I wanted to be covered everywhere I went, what would be the carrier?
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.620]   Do I choose telecom?
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.620]   Yeah, Deutsche.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.380]   Deutsche, telecom, yeah.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:21.500]   Because Deutsche owns, well, I mean, in total, it's team-
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.300]   I'm telling you, including the UK.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.620]   Oh, including, yeah, yeah, including the UK, Deutsche owns T-Mobile, which obviously
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:31.660]   is bigger around Europe and Orange in the UK, which is one of the biggest in the UK.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.100]   That's on Orange?
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.100]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:37.100]   So Germans, we've been in everything.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.460]   So that's why I am going to.
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.900]   My next phone is going to be, I was looking at the Droid X, like the Droid X.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:46.620]   In fact, when we come back, I want to get you guys' opinion.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:47.900]   I like the Droid X.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:53.460]   I'm interested, but I'm looking at the Samsung Galaxy S line and I think that the T-Mobile
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:56.220]   one is the one I'm going to get because it's a GSM.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:57.580]   I can take it out of the Nexus one.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.980]   I can put it in there and I can go out.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.500]   We'll do that in just a second.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.660]   We'll talk about that.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:09.580]   And Google, Google and China agree on a fiction.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:10.580]   What is going on in China?
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:13.100]   We'll get the details just a bit before we do though.
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.420]   Time to talk about audio books.
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:15.420]   Who here?
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.020]   Who here listens to audio books?
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.380]   Anybody in the panel?
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:24.020]   Oh, everybody in the audience and Will Harris, you don't have audible in the UK, do you?
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.740]   Yes, we do.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:31.660]   Contrary to popular opinion, we have these modern technologies, books that can be read over
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.660]   audio.
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.660]   You have audio books?
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.660]   You have audio books?
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660]   Wow, I say.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.660]   What a good idea.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:40.300]   Actually, some of the best audio books are from the UK.
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:46.380]   Stephen Fry reading the Harry Potter books is exactly die for.
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:47.380]   John Lee?
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.380]   Who's John Lee?
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:54.020]   One of the readers for Harry Potter or Audible?
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:59.300]   Madam Monique, okay, I'm getting a recommendation right now from our live studio audience for
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.140]   the count of Monique Cristo.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:02.700]   We're talking about Audible.com.
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.580]   Audible is your audio bookstore.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.740]   75,000, actually that's got a date.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.540]   I'm sure it's now 80 or 90,000.
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:12.460]   It's growing all the time because Audible's recording new books all the time and they're
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:16.380]   getting them from all the best audio book creators.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.260]   The best readers with the best fiction.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:22.460]   There's not a title out there that you nowadays almost always can guarantee you're going to
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:25.140]   be able to get all the bestsellers at Audible.com.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.700]   I'm a huge Audible fan.
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:32.580]   I think anybody who listens to the show knows by now this is Audible and me.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:37.740]   Go together like grilled cheese and tomato soup.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.940]   Count of Monique Cristo.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.740]   You know why I'm thinking of that because of a Monique Cristo sandwich?
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:45.180]   That's what you got me going on that one.
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.180]   Let's see.
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:49.060]   You say that there's one narrated by Orson Welles.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:51.860]   Yeah, that's going to be good.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:56.500]   Do you think the John Leena, this is the unabridged because the Orson Welles is 51 minutes.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.980]   Orson's very expensive.
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.980]   If you get the unabridged count of Monique Cristo, one of the great books of all time,
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:04.740]   by the way, which I loved, the man in the iron mask.
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:07.620]   Oh, I love this book.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.340]   47 hours.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.180]   This is going to last you and you can get it free.
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:16.420]   In fact, you get two books free if you go to Audible.com/twit2.
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.540]   I'll tell you what, get that and the three musketeers.
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.540]   No.
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:22.540]   The three musketeers terrible.
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:23.540]   Oh, wow.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:26.740]   I'm getting, I'm getting some reviews here.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:27.740]   Okay.

[01:25:51.420 --> 01:26:10.740]   I'm going to go to the Miserable.com/twit2.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:27.140]   That's
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:50.100]   the Miserable.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:27:12.820]   I'm going to go to the Miserable.
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:22.460]   Oh, I know who you're talking about.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.260]   The older one.
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:25.900]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.580]   What the heck is that guy's name?
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:29.700]   So do you just listen to John Lee?
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:30.700]   No.
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:31.700]   No.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.260]   You don't like, because Graham would be great that one.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:34.260]   Who?
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:35.260]   You grant would be great.
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:36.260]   I'd listen to that one.
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:37.260]   He would be.
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:38.260]   He'd be awesome.
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:39.900]   They should have an, okay, I'm going to go tell the Audible folks.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.940]   You need a section of guys with Ponzi British accents.
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.380]   Bill Nye is the guy you think you know.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.540]   Bill Nye, I love him.
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:47.540]   You know, he was great.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.540]   He would be.
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:49.540]   He would be radio.
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:50.700]   He is so good.
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:51.700]   I love him.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:52.700]   It's portable.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.500]   Go and get Bill Nye.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:55.500]   Maybe they have him.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:56.500]   B-I-L-L-N-I-G-H-E.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.300]   Is that how you spell it?
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.300]   G-H-Y.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.300]   G-H-Y.
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.300]   Nye.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.300]   Maybe they have him.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.300]   You can search for him.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:04.300]   I tell you what, here's what you do.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:05.300]   You go to Audible.com/twit2.
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.380]   Oh, listen to this.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:10.580]   Oh, radio crimes.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.620]   A Charles Paris mystery.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.860]   The dead side of the mic.
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.060]   This is Bill Nye and Susanette Suzanne Burno.
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:19.500]   Charles Paris' escort agency, Leatherware of Speciality.
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.100]   What have it happened with me?
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:26.100]   You've got the wrong ringtone plus a foxy at all fronts is on the screen.
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.700]   I'm not fucking one time.
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.660]   Well, yeah, I don't think that's a book.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.260]   Ah, yes it is.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.500]   The second sex conversation between two people.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.500]   Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.140]   Okay, if you're Bill Nye fan.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.580]   This is a great book which I did read.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.780]   Eric Clapton's autobiography, narrated by Bill Nye.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.940]   You gotta love that.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:44.940]   Nice.
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:47.380]   Took about a conflation of Orson worlds.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:50.980]   So when she found out she was pregnant, she had to cope on her own.
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:55.940]   Rose and Jack protected her and I was born secretly in the upstairs back bedroom of their
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:59.300]   house on the 30th of March, 1945.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.740]   And this is it, by the way, one of the great rock and roll biographies.
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:03.740]   Really enjoyed it.
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:06.340]   You're trying to want to hear Clapton reading it though, don't you?
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.340]   It's written first person.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:12.300]   Yeah, well, you know, they probably couldn't get Eric to sit still for that long.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.300]   You know, he can sing.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:14.500]   He can probably read.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.500]   He'll be good.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.500]   So.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.140]   All right, we're going to lobby for that too.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:21.380]   So Bill Nye's got six books on Audible.com.
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.380]   So there you go.
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:23.380]   Excellent.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:24.380]   Audible.com/Twit2C.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.180]   Here's the problem.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:27.180]   Pickin' two.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:29.340]   Audible plays on everything your iPhone.
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.540]   Android now has the best Audible application.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:33.180]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:35.540]   You can download any of your Audible books directly onto the phone.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.340]   This is something the iPhone needs desperately.
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:39.380]   I hope they do one for the iPhone.
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:43.980]   It also, many GPS devices, almost all the MP3 players, Kindles.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:46.180]   I mean, you know, 500 different devices.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:50.620]   You can listen to your books wherever you are at the gym, at work, on a commute.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:52.900]   I listen while I'm doing the shows, to be honest with you.
[01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:53.900]   I'm not paying attention.
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.340]   I'm listening to an Audible book.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.980]   Audible.com/Twit2C.
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:01.500]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Tech.
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:04.780]   I think this is probably, I probably buried the lead on this, the big story of the week,
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:09.940]   which is that Google, which is about to lose its license in China, its Internet Content
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:19.220]   Provider license, decided to stop redirecting Google searches at google.cendahongcong, so
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:21.380]   that they could get their license renewed.
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:24.300]   They replay, this is weird stuff they're doing.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:31.180]   They, in fact, didn't get their license renewed on Friday.
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:33.980]   Because, well, so here's what they're doing.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:42.060]   Google has replaced the search box on google.cend with a picture of a search box.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:46.340]   When you click, so it's not, it's, you can't type any, no field, it's just an image.
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:51.180]   When you click on it, it takes you to google.hk.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:57.380]   And apparently, this was a bad face saving because the Chinese authority said, "Okay, that's
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:59.820]   what that's all we care about."
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:05.380]   So Google's still in China, still redirecting, but you can't fill out a form.
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:08.340]   You have to click a link.
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:12.900]   I think the real issue is that Google is, is something that the Chinese elites weren't
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.460]   really willing to give up.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.980]   And so that's why they blinked.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:16.980]   What do you think, guys?
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:20.060]   Dwight, you have any thought about this?
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.020]   Well, the thing with the image is weird.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:26.900]   I don't quite understand why that would mollify the Chinese.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.540]   Because they wanted to be mollified.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.540]   I guess so.
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:32.020]   Oh yeah, you put that there.
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:38.380]   And it's not, I guess because you're not actually typing in a search at google.cend that then
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:44.060]   goes to google.hk, you're clicking on, I guess, a portal that takes you there?
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:45.060]   I don't know.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.060]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:49.260]   It's, it's, you know, it's, it's probably, it's a cultural thing, I suspect.
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:55.060]   But yeah, the, the headline on there, they agreed to a fiction, I think, is, is apt.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:58.580]   Remember, this is the country that invented diplomacy.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:03.420]   I mean, this is, they, they've got ways and ways around this thing.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:09.220]   I'm glad to see that Google is at least kind of doing what it can to stand up for what
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:10.660]   it originally said it was going to do.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:14.780]   You know, they could have caved in order to keep that license and they found a way to
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.220]   continue to offer unfiltered searches.
[01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:18.220]   And good for them.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:21.660]   I suspect the people in China who wanted to get unfiltered searches could have gotten
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:22.660]   them anyway.
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:23.660]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:26.780]   You know, it's difficult to know with the, with the, with Google's, I mean, Google's
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:31.860]   motivations, their outward motivations are to, they don't want their search results censored.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:36.700]   But I'm not sure that that, I mean, I don't think this is the only situation where the
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.540]   search results are being censored.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:44.820]   I mean, it may be a little more extreme than other places, but Google, obviously, each localized
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:51.540]   search is going to have, you know, that region's idiosyncrasies.
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:55.140]   I mean, I don't believe that they're just straight up unfiltered search everywhere in
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.140]   the world.
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:33:00.620]   I mean, I can't tell if there's another business reason here why Google is doing this or if
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.780]   it says purely, they want to stay in China.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:07.660]   I mean, you're saying China, I mean, they're not winning in the search market race there.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.660]   They're being beat pretty badly.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:14.700]   But I don't know if it's just pure altruism that they just want to bring freedom to the
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:16.420]   Chinese and their searches.
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:20.260]   Well, I mean, I'm sure you followed this that the, you know, that they're Schmidt, Eric
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:25.180]   Schmidt, we didn't want to abandon the market, wanted to give in to Chinese authorities and
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:28.260]   follow Chinese law.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:32.420]   And that Larry Page was the purist who said, no, we can't, we can't do that.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:35.020]   That violates our deeply held beliefs.
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:38.300]   I don't want to be in China if we have to filter our search results and that what's
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:43.700]   happened is both sides have found a compromise that lets them not lose face, but kind of
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:44.700]   win the point.
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:47.180]   I think in a way that you'd have to say the Chinese government is the one that gave in
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.500]   on this.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.980]   I mean, you still can search, you have unfiltered search in China now via Google.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:58.500]   They give in or they reach just a really face saving, like you said, faces kind of like,
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.620]   you know, here's what I mean, how much, how much they care, I think is the question.
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:04.580]   I think I think a you're right.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:08.900]   Baidu, the Chinese search engine is huge, much bigger than Google, which I'm sure is under
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:09.900]   complete control.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:14.500]   Of course it is completely censored, but the Chinese elites, and I think this is not
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.540]   to be ignored, used Google and wanted Google.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:24.180]   So the Chinese government said, well, look, as long as the people don't find Falun Gong
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:31.300]   in their search results, they keep using Baidu, we know we want to keep our elites happy too.
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:35.060]   And so this, I think this is a way of of, of, of modifying the elites by letting, letting
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.580]   Google stay in China.
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:40.020]   That's who, that's who uses Google in China as intellectuals.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.020]   The idea of elites in a, in a communist country is.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.940]   Oh, there are elites.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.460]   Well, it's not a communist.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:48.300]   The whole idea of communism to eliminate elitism.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:50.540]   It's not a, it's a very capitalistic country.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:52.540]   Very, very much.
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:53.540]   It's the worst.
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:54.540]   It's the worst of both worlds.
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:55.540]   I don't know.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:59.660]   The worst part of communism mixed with, which is like a dictatorship, dictatorship mixed
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:02.380]   with the worst part of capitalism, which is unbridled.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:03.380]   Greed.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:07.340]   You know, unbridled greed with the expense of any human life.
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:10.580]   You know, look, I don't, you know, I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of hate.
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:13.340]   Well, J.C. Wayne's pointing out in a chat room, this is true that there still is the
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:14.620]   great firewall of China.
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:19.780]   So you could find Falun Gong pages, references, but then to click on that page, you won't
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.540]   necessarily be able to get it.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:24.060]   So the search results are unfiltered.
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:30.740]   Google is returning information unfettered, but China still controls what pages you get
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.740]   to see.
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:34.020]   So are we about to have another China in Australia?
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.740]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:40.540]   Is it the Chinese Australian government has for a long time and really trying to get
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:45.100]   to filter search results or pages in effect?
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:50.460]   Now demand, is this the law now that they demand that ISPs block certain sites?
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:53.100]   What sites are they blocking?
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:58.300]   I don't know that they've, I'm not sure that they actually have, I think that law is percolating.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.140]   I'm not sure it's necessarily in place.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.140]   It's not in place yet.
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:05.820]   The Perth boy who I presume is in Australia says, no, I don't think that's in place.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:07.820]   It's the goal, but it's the end game.
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:14.780]   But, well, this is the same country that proposed that filters be put on all computers.
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:19.540]   And then of course, the filter was immediately broken by people.
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:25.900]   Yeah, I mean, in Australia, sorry, just going to say in Australia, the sort of the governing
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:29.180]   party there has said they want to roll this out.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:32.460]   And they've said that since 2008, but as of yet, they haven't yet done it.
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:36.860]   Current status according to Perth boy and our other Australians, and we have quite a
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:40.220]   few in the chatroom is that the law has been put on hold for a year.
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:45.420]   It was a really interesting, I mean, the comprehensive is Wikipedia to org slash internet
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.780]   censorship in Australia.
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:47.980]   There you go.
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:49.020]   It's all there.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:49.980]   And what is that?
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:50.860]   And what was the goal here?
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:53.740]   What were they trying to, I'm, I somehow have missed this.
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:56.300]   I think you have the children.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.060]   I think you have.
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:59.660]   They're trying to censor child porn.
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:07.660]   I think you have a very reactionary wing of the Australian parliament or government or
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:12.300]   whatever they call it, that is, that is really scared of the internet and really does want
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.300]   to filter it.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:16.380]   And I think that you also have there a lot of cooler heads, including, I understand most
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:20.380]   of the ISPs in Australia who hate this idea.
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.300]   They don't want to have anything to do with it.
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:23.300]   Facebook.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:30.620]   According to inside Facebook, Facebook's June US traffic did not grow so good.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:33.900]   Facebook's growth slowed in the US.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:42.220]   Only 320,000 new monthly users in June compared to get ready 7.8 million the month before.
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:45.980]   Didn't, not only didn't grow, it crashed.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:49.260]   Now the question is, yeah, I think it's over.
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:50.620]   So let's call it.
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:54.380]   It's, we're going to call it 450 PM on June 11th.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.380]   What's going to be hot?
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.820]   It's a good thing that Google, Google me is hot.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:01.540]   It's just stepping in to take the place of Facebook.
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:02.540]   So here's a question.
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.660]   And I think they debated this on TNT earlier.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:08.020]   We have a great daily news show now, by the way, everybody should listen to with Tom Merritt,
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:11.420]   Becky Worley, Sarah Lane, Dr. Kiki and many others.
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:17.020]   And that's every weekday afternoon, 230 to 330 on live.tv Pacific.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.900]   That's 530 to 630 Eastern.
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:19.900]   But they debated this earlier.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.340]   And the real question is, is it that Facebook saturated?
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:27.140]   Like everybody in the world is already a member, so you're not going to grow as fast.
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:29.580]   Or people are reacting to the privacy issue.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:30.820]   I have to think of the former, right?
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.980]   The people that is just saturated.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:33.980]   People are not reacting.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:37.740]   I mean, there are a few people who are reacting to the privacy issue.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:40.660]   Most people aren't barely aware of the privacy issue.
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:45.700]   I think the fact is that, you know, in the sort of the markets that Facebook has launched
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:50.580]   into the sort of, you know, primarily Western markets, they are pretty much saturated.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:54.340]   I mean, who do you know who's online doesn't really have a Facebook account?
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:57.100]   The major growth, I think, and I think Mark's like a bird said this, at a conference.
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:01.660]   A few weeks ago is going to come for Facebook in developing nations.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:03.340]   And that's how they're going to get to a billion years.
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:08.580]   But they do say that, you know, Zuckerberg said that a billion users is inevitable for Facebook.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.540]   They're the question of being in the game.
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:13.740]   The question of Facebook needs to break through is, place where the farm villain needs to be played
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:18.180]   is places where people are actually farming a lot in real life.
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:22.660]   No, I think that would cause a collapse of the food chain and we would all die.
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.820]   I agree that I agree that that's important.
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:26.420]   Yeah, that's a question of saturation.
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:30.700]   I mean, well, I mean, they don't have everybody, but they've got a lot of people.
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:36.420]   And when you balloon to a certain point and then you have to hang out there a little bit,
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:40.860]   you know, and I think that I don't think the privacy issue is real to a lot of people.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:45.660]   I think we're going to talk about this on the last show that I think that it's a small
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:46.660]   group of people.
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.540]   I mean, how successful was the quick Facebook day?
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:49.540]   Not very successful.
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:52.060]   I think 30 or 40,000 people quit, not a huge.
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:56.460]   That's probably about how many people are really upset over the privacy issues that are even
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:57.460]   aware of them.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:58.460]   Right.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:39:59.540]   I think you're right.
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:02.460]   So saturation, we vote for saturation.
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:03.460]   Or it's dead.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:05.460]   Or it's totally dead.
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:11.020]   You know, it would, I think, you know, it would have a chance of being dead if there
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:13.220]   were an alternative, but there just isn't.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.540]   And this is where the network effect is so hard to overcome.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:18.500]   You know, when you've got a billion people, or in this case half a billion people using
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:22.220]   something, it's pretty hard to get them to move all at once to somewhere else.
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:23.420]   Now there's a monopoly.
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.660]   You want to see somebody from an op-ed?
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:27.660]   You can start Facebook.
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:32.980]   So they monopolize the social networking space online and it's simply impossible to
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.980]   break into it.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:38.700]   Now, these same kind of things were said about AOL when AOL is said it's cannot be killed.
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:39.700]   Right.
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.900]   And AOL, to me, Facebook is AOL.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.940]   I mean, I've seen this before.
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:51.780]   And the difference is that AOL had a fixed distribution system kind of like newspapers
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:56.900]   where they had, they connected and got to people through dial-up modems and they weren't
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:59.300]   able to make the leap to broadband.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:00.580]   And that's kind of what killed them.
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:06.580]   At some point, there could be something that Facebook basically just doesn't deal with
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:09.020]   well that could take it offline.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:11.420]   It's going to have to be something like that.
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:14.700]   So do you guys, any of you play Star Wars or Starcraft?
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:15.700]   Rather.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.420]   Back in the day.
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:18.420]   Back in the day.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.420]   Loved that kid.
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:21.420]   Starcraft 2 is a...
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.420]   Land party to Starcraft.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:26.540]   I've always had the sensation when you play online with people, not like land parties like
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.220]   your friends, fine.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:31.020]   But when you play against strangers on the internet that there are just some people who
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:34.580]   live in a different world from you and me.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:35.660]   And now I know it for sure.
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:38.300]   This is from a documentary called The Hacks Life.
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:40.260]   Got this from ours Technica.
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:46.940]   They call it actions per minute to be a truly good Starcraft player, or I guess any game
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.580]   like this.
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:53.140]   You have to be able to click 200 actions a minute.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.140]   Oh my God.
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:55.860]   Look at this guy.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.100]   This is a top class.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:41:59.220]   This is not sped up.
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:00.220]   This is in real time.
[01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:05.380]   A top class Korean player.
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:06.380]   He is...
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:07.380]   Wow.
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:08.380]   He is playing...
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:13.820]   I think he is up to 200 actions per minute.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:20.980]   He said it's an average rate of how quickly your fingers move.
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:28.420]   To win a championship it should be at least over 200 and in the low 300s per minute.
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:33.300]   And you've got to see this video because as he's clicking...
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:34.300]   I don't know how he's thinking.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.700]   I can see how you could click that fast.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.420]   I don't know how you could think that fast.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:42.980]   He says he puts sandbags under his wrist to speed up his speed.
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:45.420]   You've got to watch this guy.
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:46.420]   Look at this guy.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:47.420]   Wow.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:49.580]   When he's not doing this he's pushing out iPhone 4.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.780]   When he's not doing this he's not doing anything.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:54.420]   I think this is all this guy does ever.
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:55.420]   He's pretty...
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.420]   He's got professional.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:57.420]   I guess so.
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:58.420]   He doesn't even...
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:42:59.420]   Apparently he doesn't even cut his nails.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:00.420]   I don't think he has time.
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:01.420]   Look at this.
[01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:04.940]   He probably needs longer nails since he gets to reach less far to the keys.
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:09.340]   So if you've ever played Starcraft and you wonder why do I keep getting my ass out of
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:10.340]   it to me?
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.340]   It's because of this.
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:13.340]   It's because of this part of...
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:16.540]   Is this part of his money making scheme?
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:17.540]   No, no.
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:18.540]   This isn't gold.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.540]   This isn't gold.
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:20.540]   What do they call that?
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:22.540]   Gold digging golf?
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:23.540]   No.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:25.340]   It's not gold digging.
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:27.140]   This is just this guy.
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:28.540]   He just likes it.
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:29.540]   Likes it.
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:30.540]   Likes to play.
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:31.540]   He's a champion.
[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:33.580]   I used to be a pretty avid Quake 3 arena player.
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:34.580]   I was horrible.
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:35.580]   I had the...
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:42.220]   My game was the llama king and there was a reason for that.
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:48.500]   But what I would do is I would go to like Quakecon and I would play just for the experience.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:53.700]   I'd play against some of these like fatality and so forth as part of the press tournament.
[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:56.300]   It was just astonishing to what these guys could do.
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:44:01.620]   I couldn't fathom either watching them standing behind them or playing against them how they
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:02.620]   did what they do.
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:03.620]   It just doesn't seem human.
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:05.620]   It's like Ender's game.
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:09.140]   It's like they're...
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:12.460]   Their brain is plugged into that environment in a way.
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.220]   I mean, I like playing FPSes.
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:18.060]   I mean, every once in a while I'll play a multiplayer deathmatch.
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:20.700]   We played a couple of years ago at CES.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.740]   We had a few nights where we...
[01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:26.620]   Late late at night we had some unreal matches with the whole team, the whole endgats game.
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.620]   So that's fun.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:28.620]   If you're playing in friends.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:29.620]   Because they're not...
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:30.940]   And we were all in the same rooms.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:35.900]   It was like 25 people in the same room playing, which was an enormous amount of fun.
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:40.900]   But I was surprised because I had played it before and had not played it for a long time.
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:42.940]   And it comes back to you.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:44.260]   It's like riding a bike.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:46.260]   It's this weird memory.
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:49.020]   It's like you get in there and then you can do it.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.020]   But they're operating.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.980]   I mean, the guys who do that professionally are operating on a level that is just completely...
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:56.460]   I mean, the government should be talking to those guys about it.
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.460]   I'm sure they are.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:58.460]   It's so simple.
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:44:59.460]   They're running the predators.
[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.460]   I'm sure it's the same guys.
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.500]   And the base one in Las Vegas.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:03.500]   It probably is.
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:04.660]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:08.220]   But that's why, you know, just so you know, that's why it's so hard when you play online
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:09.220]   with real people.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.700]   We used to do a LAN party at the screensavers.
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:11.940]   In fact, it was so much fun.
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:12.940]   We'd play Halo.
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:16.220]   It was so much fun that sometimes we'd be coming back from the commercial and it'd be like,
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:18.460]   "No, wait, no, wait, no...
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:20.500]   Because you just don't want to stop.
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:21.500]   It really is.
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.500]   It really is a lot of fun."
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.820]   It makes me want to have LAN parties.
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:24.820]   I know.
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:27.740]   Well, one of the things I've wanted to do, we will do this.
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:31.940]   Ryan Brushwood runs a team fortress clan.
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:33.340]   But I think we will do this.
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:38.020]   I want to, in fact, if anybody listening can do this, I would like a level of some game.
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:39.020]   Could be any game.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.020]   Could be Quake, Quake III.
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:41.420]   I would like a level of the Twit cottage.
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:42.420]   We'll send you plans.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:43.420]   We'll send you pictures.
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:44.420]   Make a level.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:45.420]   Oh, I'm there.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:46.420]   I'm so there.
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:48.100]   Make a level.
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:49.820]   And then we had this.
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:52.660]   We had a screensaver set level of Unreal.
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:53.660]   So make a level.
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:57.700]   And then we will host a big LAN party after Twit every week.
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:58.700]   I'm into that.
[01:45:58.700 --> 01:45:59.700]   Quake III would be good.
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.980]   Yeah, that would be a good one.
[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:04.980]   It's kind of the lowest common denominator game now.
[01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:08.660]   Yeah, well, anybody who's got the skills, look, if you're the designer, you get to choose
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:09.660]   the game.
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.740]   But we'll send you anything you need.
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:12.740]   All the schematics.
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:16.020]   Actually, it would be a good thing because we don't know what the hell's going on in
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:17.020]   here anyway.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.020]   We probably should make some schematics.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:20.340]   Joshua Topolsky, so nice to have you.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:23.340]   I'm the editor-in-chief of Engadget.com.
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.340]   Great to be here.
[01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:25.340]   It's a must-read.
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:28.060]   The Engadget podcast is every week, right?
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.820]   Every week we do it usually on Thursday or Friday.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:34.420]   We put up a post and let people know and then we do the Engadget show once a month.
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:38.820]   It's a live event here in New York and we'll be doing one pretty soon.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:41.780]   We'd love to get you back on the Twit Network doing that too.
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.700]   It was really fun when we broadcast.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.100]   Simulcast, I guess.
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:46.780]   Your Engadget podcast.
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:47.780]   Engadget.com.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:55.900]   Dwight Silverman is the tech blogger at theHoustonCronicleBlogs.com/techblog.
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:58.820]   And must-read every day in his link role, especially useful.
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:00.580]   He also hosts technology bites.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.340]   One of, what, like just 12 hosts or something on that show.
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:05.580]   I think there's six of us.
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:06.780]   A lot of people.
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:07.780]   Yes.
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:13.020]   It's basically, it sounds like a bunch of guys sitting around making fun of people with
[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:14.740]   computer problems for two hours.
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:15.740]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:16.740]   It's really a great show.
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:18.100]   If you're in the Houston area, you must-
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:20.620]   Is it on all of Pacifica or just Houston?
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:27.420]   It's just on KPFT but you can get the podcast at geekradio.com.
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:31.860]   It's the podcast goes up the next morning kind of the way Twit does and you can listen
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:32.860]   to it.
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:33.860]   It's also on iTunes.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.540]   It's called technology bites.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:36.900]   So great to see you again, Will Harris.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.100]   I know it's very late.
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:40.180]   Did you stay up and watch?
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:43.300]   We won't say anything but you stayed up and watched the game.
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.660]   Oh, I can't hear you.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:46.660]   I potted you down.
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:47.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:49.860]   Have you been trying to talk this whole time?
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:52.460]   Well, I'm always trying to talk.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:54.860]   I accidentally turned you up.
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:56.420]   I'm actually poor Will.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:58.020]   No wonder you're sitting there with your head in your hands.
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:47:59.020]   I'm so sorry.
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:00.940]   I had you potted down.
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:01.940]   I apologize.
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:02.940]   Level failed.
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.500]   I thought it was the vuvuzela mic I was turning off.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:12.340]   I thought this was the one place I thought I could escape.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:13.340]   Never.
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:14.340]   Never.
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:17.660]   Somebody did it with the vuvuzela and they did a layering of them in different pitches.
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:17.660]   So it started off with the baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:47.660]   But I thought it was the baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa baa b
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:49:11.220]   I was rooting for you right till the second round.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:21.620]   Yeah, nobody else was reading for us.
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:22.940]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:23.940]   We are going to Detroit.
[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.100]   I wanted to give you a program.
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.660]   No, July 31st, which is a Friday.
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:33.100]   We're going to be broadcasting live via our U live U backpack that lets us broadcast live
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:37.900]   anywhere from I understand we're going to get a tour of Dearborn and the assembly lines.
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:40.260]   We're going to see how a modern car is built for us.
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.220]   It's going to take us there to the Ford plant.
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:44.260]   We can actually watch to go and look at the assembly line stuff.
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:45.740]   I can't wait for that.
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:50.420]   And then the day after Maker Faire Detroit, we're going to be bringing you live coverage,
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:51.420]   visit some of the vuvuzela.
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:56.700]   It'll be our traditional kind of crazy conference coverage where we become your eyes and ears
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:57.700]   at a trade.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:58.700]   So that'll be a lot of fun.
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:01.060]   That's August 1st in Detroit.
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:02.700]   We do have some other exciting events coming up.
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:04.700]   I know Tom Merr is going to be a comic con.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:08.860]   We're going to send Tom and a bunch of other folks to DragonCon in September.
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:12.820]   And of course, our coverage of CES is going to be even better than ever in January.
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:15.100]   We're working on this because we want to do more live stuff.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:18.860]   Don't forget TNT every Monday through Friday.
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:24.220]   Tech news today with Tom Merritt and his great co-hosts 230 to 330 Pacific.
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:28.060]   That's 536 30 p.m. easterntime@live.twit.tv.
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.140]   Tom Merritt's coming up next with East Means West.
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:31.140]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:32.140]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:33.140]   Another Twit.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:35.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:37.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:41.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:43.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:45.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:51.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:54.140]   He's in the can.
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:55.140]   He's in the can.
