[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.680]   As you know, it's been kind of a tough year. And in years past we've flown in hosts from all
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.000]   over the world. We've had celebrities like Judge John Hodgman, Jonathan Colton.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.480]   But this year it's just going to be us. And I think that's kind of fun. The hosts on today's
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.640]   Twit end of year special. And Pruitt from Hands On Photography. And he's born good, good, good,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.160]   because you didn't have any holiday festive cheer around. I thought a little something brown
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.480]   might be good. Yellowstone Bourbon, sir. Ooh, Yellowstone. From the National Park
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.760]   or the TV show. Not quite the National Park. Okay. So the TV show. All right. That is Jason
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.680]   Howell of All About Android Tech News Weekly. Hi, Jason.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.320]   Hello. It's good to be here. I wish I had remembered that liquor could be a part of this.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.040]   It can be all the way downstairs. Well, it can be. The problem is I'm in the corner of my bedroom
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.440]   behind this desk that requires me to basically do like a ninja warrior course in order to get out
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.560]   of this, right? So send to carry your pigeons. We were really hoping to have y'all in studio. In
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.160]   fact, when we planned this, we thought we would be able to. And then Oh, Macron, the least favorite
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.040]   Greek letter. Also with this, Micah Sargent from his home. Hey, Micah. Hello, my least favorite Greek
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.840]   letter is was a canoe canoe canoe. Yeah, canoe. That's it. No, there's no Greek letter canoe.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.880]   What do you thought? What is that? There's loving to do this. I'm going to do this because I spent
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.360]   misspent youth learning the Greek alphabet. Alpha beta gamma delta epsilon zeta eta theta.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.680]   You just stopped me when you hear the worst one. Zeta eta theta yoda kappa lambda moon new.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.600]   Now I pronounce it C. But that's C. I don't like C. I don't know what he does. Although my friend
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.320]   who is in the fraternity says, Oh, no, that's she. Anyway, I got to do it fast. Alpha beta gamma
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.880]   delta epsilon zeta theta yoda kappa lambda moon nuke C. Omicron fee keep C omega.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.280]   No, I'm lost track. Wait, I get the whole chunk in the middle.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.640]   I think it's not like I like C omega. Now I've something new. Omicron.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.840]   Something new. Omicron. Anyway, it's the PSI one. I have a sea. Oh, no, that's that's at the end.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.160]   See there's see the X I see and PS actually none of that's real because it's the Greek alphabet is
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.920]   not Roman alphabet. So I don't know what it is. P I forgot P P. We're gonna make sure
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   you trust. Oops. So long. He keeps you omega. Pardon me. I just I was convinced that you knew
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.440]   these can do the always the new one and I'm we're gonna add that alphabet.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:08.160]   Can you I don't know canoe. Anyway, good. Thank you guys for sharing this time with me. We are
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.600]   recording this a little early of course because you all be busy. Jason, you have little kids,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.960]   little kids who still think long one Christmas is a great holiday. Yep, they're they're still
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.240]   convinced. I won't say every loud because they're on the other side of the door. It's gonna be so
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.840]   much fun. You might actually hear them throughout the recording of this episode because I love it
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.680]   from school for the week, which means they're going crazy, bouncing off the walls trying to
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.240]   entertain themselves. Scooter X is your point. Our our chat room is with us at irc.tv. Scooter
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:45.280]   X suggests you broadcast a message and you're smart speakers. Honey. Can you bring some bows?
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.920]   All right, please get a Manhattan. We're gonna this this episode as we usually do,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.760]   we're gonna look back at the year which is actually not a festive thing this year at all. We'll find
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   something to be festive about. But I thought one of the things that happened this year is I got a
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.880]   very special candle from a PR agency thanking me for having one of their people on our shows,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.760]   which as far as I know we never did. Maybe that explains the candle because the the official
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.000]   sense of this is smitten. So I thought this would be appropriate during our holiday show.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.880]   We should have a little you know we've got the fake fire. Let's have some let's have some real
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.520]   flame. I'm gonna light-standing the candle and when I blow the candle out that'll be it the last
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.720]   all-tweet of the year. There we go. So the little candle we should mention next week is the best
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:49.120]   of episode. Right? Am I right? January 9th is gonna be a very special future episode. So we
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.680]   traditionally do this. We've done this for years where one episode looks back at the year gone by
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.960]   this episode. And then in two weeks we're gonna do an episode and this was Amy Webb's idea.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.960]   Predicting the future, Amy Webb our favorite future is so Jonas. So one of my favorite sci-fi
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:13.040]   authors. I'm so excited. Daniel Suarez of yeah really love him of demon and freedom TM and
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.960]   freedom. Somebody great books. We'll join us. I figured somebody who spends a lot of time thinking
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.320]   about the future should probably have something to say. And then we have a player to be named later
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.360]   but we have some ideas we're working on. Not only does he think about the future but he thinks about
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.880]   like the interoperability of networks. Yeah he's a really good guy to get for this because
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   all of his books kind of our near future. Here's where technology will take us kind of stuff.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.320]   And I think that's really that's fascinating. So Daniel will be a great guest. Of course that's
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.400]   what Amy does for a living. But I'm now and I've been put it off. It's time to take a look back.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:59.760]   Oh my god. The year that was 2021. So it was 2020 right which is when it all started the COVID
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:09.440]   nightmare. Then then people were saying oh yeah 2021 WON. And then Lisa the other day realized oh no
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:16.960]   it's 2022. So oh god. Here that will not. That's what it is. The year that will not give up.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.880]   I guess if we're going to talk about the year passed and the year in technology.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.760]   So but we took but COVID has had a huge impact on tech. It's had people working from home. In fact
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:35.120]   that may go on forever. I think in some ways it's changed how tech companies work. Many companies
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.880]   are now hiring people all over the world and letting them work from home. Of course the great
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:48.560]   resignation has impacted tech. And I think you could also say that the COVID-19 is complicit.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:56.160]   Maybe not the total cause of the supply chain shortage. So yeah tech very much affected. Oh and
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.640]   there's one more. And there's a bright side to COVID-19. A lot of tech billionaires got really rich.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:11.120]   Yay tech billionaires. It was COVID's been great for Amazon. Right. I mean yeah.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.520]   Still an ample ordering than there ever have been. And you know I was just on Twitter yesterday
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.960]   seeing different people kind of talking about the year. And that was one of the things that
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.560]   they were talking about is not only are you ordering your Amazon packages but people who are doing
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.240]   grocery delivery. So many of those new kind of industries that at least here in California
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.320]   have had an interesting go of things due to the different laws that we've tried to put in place to
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.080]   protect those individual delivery drivers. This has been even more of a thing this year than ever
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:50.720]   before because we are relying on them so much. And we've trying to kind of adapt the way that we
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.640]   do or do not go shopping and visit stores and use folks who are there to do that.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:07.440]   In the first three months of 2021 Amazon's profit tripled up 220 percent profit up 220 percent
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:16.720]   eight point one billion dollars. And of course who who benefited from that besides the shareholders
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.640]   the the chief shareholder the shareholder and chief Jeff Bezos. But his title as the world's richest
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:29.920]   man was short lived because another guy who benefited from COVID-19 Elon Musk quickly overtook him and
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:36.320]   is currently as of this recording they're in a battle a race the richest man in the world.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:43.040]   Elon is also the Time magazine Man of the Year financial times man of the year.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.480]   Oh Elon not necessarily for good reasons. Yeah he's more for notorious reasons than anything else.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.880]   He's a troll of the year. Told the year. Just have to be one of the richest people on the planet.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.440]   You want to guess just I know no I remember in the back in the day when we were all talking about
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.880]   Bill Gates being the richest guy in the world he had 32 billion it was like how can it what he even
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.840]   said after after a few hundred million you're infinitely wealthy there's just nothing you can
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.280]   spend that on. So how anybody don't look at the headlines want to guess what Elon is worth.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:26.480]   300 billion? Very good guess. Little high 243 billion dollars 200 how
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.000]   41 person be worth that much money like it just boggles my brain. I don't understand.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.520]   Elon of course famously tweeted a couple of well a lot of tweets a couple hundreds of tweets that
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:47.280]   were crazy one of them was should I sell my stock to pay my taxes which really wasn't a poll although
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.360]   it's a little weird that he had a Twitter poll about whether he should sell stock to pay his taxes.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.400]   He did in fact pay 11 billion dollars in taxes this year but he didn't have a choice it wasn't
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:03.440]   like I'm gonna say as he was supposed to. Yeah like the Twitter poll made up his mind okay I guess I will
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:12.480]   no he kind of had to. He also like so many tweets he also manipulated Dogecoin.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.360]   Yeah Dogecoin and continues he I think he's even still saying you know he's still riding the Doge
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.520]   train saying 2022 it's all about Doge this is where our bets are you know and oh boy that's that's a
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   whole other facet of the 2021 is the is the Dogecoin. He was invited with his great wealth to solve
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:42.240]   the world's hunger problem by I think it's a United Nations hunger commissioner and Elon said well
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.920]   if you could say in a tweet how my 10 billion would save would solve the world's hunger I'll be
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.080]   glad to do it I don't think we ever heard the end of that one I don't think. I'd like to end
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.880]   the thing is I could believe him's doing that if they say all right this is how we can allocate this
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.960]   I bet he would sign the check nobody signs checks now sorry. It's not a pleasure signing
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.760]   who could that measure 10 billion dollar check that's what I want to know right and I that's
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.680]   one of the few times where I sided with him on on this these shenanigans these days because we
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.960]   have all of these different funds and and and packages that are supposed to be doing this and
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:26.880]   that for the people but yet there's still millions and millions of people right here in our own backyard
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.480]   that are struggling and fighting to pay bills and they're getting these little six hundred dollar
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.040]   checks. It is a little painful when you look at somebody with two hundred forty three billion
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.640]   dollars more than any human ever right could need and to Elon's credit it's not like he earned it I
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   mean he didn't dig dig just during it. Oh no he didn't but he but he almost made the right moves
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.800]   at the right time. He almost bankrupt himself both with Tesla and SpaceX and I think you could
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.280]   make an argument that both Tesla and SpaceX have been a benefit to society promoting electric
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.560]   vehicles and and putting us back research research yeah uh it's not like he's not a capitalist I'm
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.480]   sure he invested in both of those with the hopes to make money but he risked his fortune to do that
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.600]   and he and he made a lot he made a pile of money is it fair to say that he benefited from COVID
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:20.000]   probably not how yeah that's what I've been trying to figure out too the one thing
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.560]   he did with COVID early on and this was actually last year he did not want to close the Tesla
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.240]   factory from California and during the early mask mandates he was told to and he refused.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.880]   That's right I remember he refused he risked not his life his employees life
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.040]   to keep making cars and he said well you know I've got to because the my competitors in Michigan
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:50.640]   are doing are not closing their plants actually what really closed plants in 2021 was supplied
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:58.960]   chain shortages shortages not not of uh not not just of the big chips like intels and
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:05.040]   AMD's chips but shortage of what we call legacy nodes the chips that things like the effect who
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.520]   was it some one car manufacturer decided to start just shipping cars uh without automatic window
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.840]   openers because it's like wow it's like we can't get the chips we want to make the trucks so let's
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.520]   just ship them out I wonder if that was Chevrolet no actually a forward I'm trying to remember
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.440]   who it was and it wasn't window openers but it was some minor like seat adjustment
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.560]   things something like seat heaters sounds like something Toyota would do you know along with
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:38.080]   their the package deal of the key fob thing they're thinking of all sorts of ways to break down
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.280]   their vehicles and make money on every single little piece uh yeah they uh we talked about
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:50.080]   that yesterday on uh or actually whoops I mean last Sunday there we go there we go good illusion
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.360]   last Sunday on uh on twit uh with Tim Stevens of course who does roadshow for cnet and he said you
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.960]   know they kind of got a lot of heat for something that maybe people pay 500 dollars for that remote
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:10.240]   start option to Toyota and it's even though it doesn't use wireless doesn't use 3g it just is a
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:17.920]   local network proprietary software right yeah um they it was always intended that you would pay
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.560]   for it they just got the first whatever three years free and so now that so it wasn't like they
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.720]   didn't it wasn't a later decision to do that I bet that was in the contract that the the
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:35.760]   customers initially signed too but it was it was however you know it's still silly it's still
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.960]   silly it's the same thing as uh BMW charging to use apples car play which they eventually
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.040]   retracted but I asked him I think I said is this gonna be do you think this will be the
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.960]   the future of of cars is we'll have subscriptions and of course yes
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:56.400]   and that was it by the way that's another um term that became uh all the rage this year
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:05.200]   revenue what was it it's our revenue per per unit eight annual revenue per our
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:11.360]   boom or a rpu annual revenue per unit and by the way your user
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:19.440]   user it's per user but it's also per unit and uh and it is it so technically it is per unit
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.560]   according to vista pedia but of course per unit is per user and the and this is apple kind of
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.520]   has done very well right mica uh saying hey we're a services company now we're gonna make in fact
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.120]   they don't even tell you how many smartphones they sold they just tell you how much they make per
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.680]   user yep and that just keeps growing as you see apple expand i mean we saw that a lot this year
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:45.040]   announcement after announcement we talked about on a smart tech today about uh apple adding its
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.960]   apple tv platform to so many different places you've got apple music on android and ios so all of
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.800]   these ways that they are able to make money continually off of those services is it's no surprise that
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:04.720]   you know you're seeing a lot of companies make that move general motors will stop shipping heated
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:12.400]   seats due to chip shortages there it is i got the actual story thank you and it's like a
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.720]   nice line that's all i'm sorry it is and they just listen and lego pieces so they're like well
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.080]   green piece it holds up yeah you don't need that to drive a car but i think it is interesting i mean
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.120]   this is tesla does this you when you buy a tesla they say if you give us ten thousand
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.400]   dollars now you'll be able to give us five hundred dollars a month down the road for full self-driving
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:40.000]   which is like way what wait yes and wait what is exactly the right response
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.960]   wait what are you serious yeah oh no oh and full self-driving
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.960]   elan said this week it'll never he said let me give you know they always talk about
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:00.080]   charge me another 500 a month yes in the future yes oh no elan said this week you know they always
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.400]   talk about the people who died in tesla full self-driving accidents they never talk about the
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.120]   people whose lives we saved okay were there any well we don't know because they well that's yeah
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.240]   they never really know that yeah yeah is that a fair thing to say like well let's focus on the
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.360]   good that full self i mean it does i you know honestly i think personally i think elan has a
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.240]   point we're i do this is the this is the new technology right this is the new technology all
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.760]   eyes are on it we went through this problem i mean i wasn't alive when we went through this
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:36.320]   but when vehicles you know when motor vehicles were new that was a new technology and there were more
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.360]   deaths as a result of motor vehicles than there were prior to it because they didn't exist and uh you
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.040]   know i i don't know i i think he's got a point i think we're so we're so quick to jump on the
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:53.280]   the fatality that happens without comparing the fatalities inside of you know tesla vehicles
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:59.040]   to just vehicles at large and i think we would probably find out that as a percentage in vehicles
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.240]   at large a lot more fatalities but it's just that tesla's the new thing we don't understand it or
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.440]   the the you know the the public doesn't understand it quite the same and so this it's extra scrutiny
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:17.440]   as a result we are there were more more traffic deaths this year than there have been since 2016
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.360]   by a huge margin there were many many many many traffic deaths this year and a lot of that is
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.960]   attributed to distracted driving so in that way yes absolutely i think that a ton of health
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.240]   looking at automated driving is a way to get past that distracted driving death is is really
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.280]   important when you look at unintended consequences of covid-19 people don't think that because the
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.640]   roads were empty for most of last year and even still a little slow this year because of you know
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.240]   people working from home and quarantining and so there's some question why traffic fatalities
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:57.200]   went up in 2020 and early 2021 the thinking is because there are fewer people on the road
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.840]   people are speeding more and of course you're much more likely to die in a high speed accident
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.440]   than you are in a slow accident so the fact that there's less traffic is actually increasing
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.840]   traffic fatalities that's that's the best theory anyway uh we are going to do at the end of the
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.440]   show by the way we are going to lift you up because i realize we're bringing you down we're
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.840]   going to lift you up with some of the funnest stories the unusual and this really belongs there
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.960]   but we're in the tesla section so i'm going to bring it up this week the first tesla baby
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.240]   a woman whose waters broke while the family was stuck in traffic they put it on autopilot
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:44.880]   while she gave birth so there you go elon not only lives saved babies born
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.400]   okay you can't deny that the world's little clap for that
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:57.200]   with contractions increasing red by this this way this happened in september we're just learning
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   about it now with with contractions increasing rapidly and traffic barely moving the couple
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.840]   realized they were not going to get to the hospital on time uh now uh keying sherry her husband put
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.600]   the vehicle in autopilot set the navigation system to the hospital 20 minutes away it's good thing he
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:24.960]   paid that 10 grand for the autopilot he said he laid one hand gently on the car's steering wheel
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.000]   as he attended to his wife she was squeezing my hand at the point where i thought she was going to
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.880]   shatter it i was saying yaron that's his wife okay focus on your breathing the decision over whether
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.320]   to try to wait to give birth until they reached the hospital was an agonizing one because traffic
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:49.360]   was stopped they said she said should i push should i hold should i push should i hold oh effet let's do
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.200]   this according to people magazine she gave birth to her daughter in the self-driving vehicle as they
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:04.160]   arrived to the hospital whispering this is this might be the motto of all of 2021 oh my god keying
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:14.560]   she's out oh boy oh boy wow is the baby's name a bunch of it should be uh schwa la la da da da
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:21.360]   yes um it's just x or y or whatever their model number one that they're tough first the first
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:28.720]   tesla baby uh congratulations to yeah mother and child are doing fine daddy keying says thank you
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:37.120]   genius tesla engineers for your brilliant design of autopilot uh this time so so elon see see that's
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:43.280]   what he loves is to elon but if this were just a regular car we wouldn't be celebrating that regular
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:49.040]   car people would have just pulled over and handled business but because they didn't have autopilot
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.760]   this wouldn't have been a news story but that's true they would have just rolled over you know what
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.720]   one of my thinking it would have been you know for years people have just pulled over and had the
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   baby we're gonna keep driving we are so efficient it's more 2021 we are efficient
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:16.400]   uh okay we multi-tow them let me try it out rational person just pull over pull over you know
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:24.800]   and as always you're the voice of reason let me just take a little breath of smitten smitten
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:31.680]   oh god is it musky or like what does it smell like eloni how do we just get the eloni
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:40.160]   it smells like elon musk after a long day at the office i think it's um floral i would say okay
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:46.640]   okay all right by the way it says on the label thank you for being a shining light in the world
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   of podcasts all right yeah very nice you've earned that sir i'm smitten
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:25:01.280]   fortunately we have a molecule here sucking all that right out of the air
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.360]   i i i had that realization this year it's like oh i can't burn candles or incense and run my air
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.760]   pure fire at the same time that's what they're taxing you're gonna actually you can go right ahead
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:19.600]   uh i did tell the story on the last twit and i'm embarrassed but of the air purifier i ran all year
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.280]   thinking boy it wasn't a molecule it was another one was a hepa i have a molecule in the bedrooms
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.200]   but i wanted a hepa in the grand room just to kind of recycle the air right uh it is because
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.400]   people come over and stuff and uh and it was a big one it was supposed to be a thousand square
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.560]   feet or something so i'm huge so like to do the whole room it was very expensive but i bought it
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.240]   um what do you call it not used refurbished
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.640]   refurbished save some money came from amazon set it up we've been running it all year oh and they
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:59.840]   call it renewed renewed you didn't hear this story so like so the light comes on last week saying
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.920]   it's time for a new filter it's been a year i said oh that's great so i opened i've ordered filters on
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.640]   amazon they come i open it up i wonder where the filters go on this there doesn't seem to be any
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.880]   apparent place to you know the old filters to take out so i um looked at the video online there were
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:23.280]   no filters they come without filters i guess i was serious for a year running this day oh this is a
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:32.240]   fan it was a very very expensive fan oh god anyway it's working now thank god we had the molecules
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.080]   uh that was so one of the points of controversy this week we talked about in all the shows was that
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.720]   elan musk was the man time of the year person of the year time person of the year
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.440]   uh and i of course always and everybody does have to point out well hittler was person the year
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.080]   once too so you know doesn't have to be a good person just a person and certainly you could say
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:59.280]   elan got a lot of attention but it was my contention that the real heroes of 2021 were the vaccine
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:06.000]   scientists particularly the mrna scientists and it turns out time did acknowledge them as like
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.920]   scientists of the years so good yeah but i think that was another thing and now here's an interesting
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.080]   point and this actually um was brought home to me when i was talking to Andy Weir the author of
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.560]   the marsh and we're talking about his new book which is excellent by the way oh yes you have to read
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:28.400]   it hill mary hill mary yes it's great uh they're making a movie out of it um oh nice yeah in fact
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.000]   we tried to get Andy Weir on our uh speculative thing uh on the ninth but he's having a baby he just
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.760]   had a baby congratulations Andy and he's like deep in production on this movie with a little
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:46.800]   disappointed to say ryan Gosling is the lead uh okay you know he's trying to go out you know and he
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:56.240]   said this in the interview and i'm going oh that's nice oh okay but the martian was so good right and
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.120]   and it was such a great movie so i'm sure this it's the same it's going to be you know the same quality
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:07.440]   and same writer so anyway uh Andy Weir i was talking about the year and so forth and he said you know
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:16.080]   what you're gonna we're gonna look back about 2021 and say wow is mrna vaccines this is a huge
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:23.440]   huge breakthrough the ability to use computers to do a genomic analysis by the way they were
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.360]   able to do that back in uh i think was november december a year ago using a computer in a weekend
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:37.680]   to generate the whole genome and then again using computers generate a vaccine that would target
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.520]   that genome they were in a in a matter of a week or two able to create a vaccine now of course what
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.520]   took so long was testing because we rightly so we want to make sure it's safe and effective
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.000]   so that took almost you know that took a long time but they were able to generate that actually
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.680]   was they did that back in 2020 almost immediately after the pandemic bit broke out
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.840]   they were able to do that and then they tested it all year the vaccine came out at the end of
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:10.240]   last year but i think this is officially the year of the mrna vaccine and Andy said you're
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:17.680]   gonna see vaccines for a huge number of diseases we've thought intractable including possibly cancer
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:26.560]   thanks to this breakthrough technology so you know we may talk about supply chain and the latest
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:32.240]   you know chip from apple but really it could very well be that mrna vaccine
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.520]   that breakthrough which by the way did not happen overnight scientists particular one
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.160]   scientist been working on a ten years laughed at mocked uh underfunded but she uh she persisted
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:53.120]   and thank goodness she was there when covid 19 showed up so yeah uh all right we can leave the
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.360]   the covid unless we want to talk about supply chain at all that is not easing up and that is
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:03.280]   going to be with us next year too more people know that word than ever before i know whoever
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.840]   it's the biggest thing everyone's blaming the supply chain right now but he's like supply chain
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:13.760]   i'm angry this morning and it's because of the supply chain well and as always i'm dead on the
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.000]   hard hits and it didn't quite work because they walk up and say hey dad can i have so and so and i
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.360]   just say supply chain and he just looks like it's a supply chain issue so you just wouldn't understand
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.840]   it's kind of weird what's missing though right like there are some things that you wouldn't expect
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.280]   i we were talking to somebody uh Jason howl and i on tech news weekly and they were saying i
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.480]   wanted to play tennis with some friends i went to the store and could not find tennis balls anywhere
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:46.320]   and it's because of the supply chain yeah it's just interesting what ends up getting hit yeah yeah
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.680]   yeah they were the vaccine scientists were time magazines heroes of the year thank you scooter x
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   for that uh correction the most the miracle workers uh and if i paid for time magazine i could
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:06.160]   show you their picture but instead i'm getting this this this might also be the year of the rise of
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.520]   the paywall this year yeah no no no rise like it's getting bigger it's it's rising up on the pay
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:17.440]   this paywall is literally a wall blocking the rest of this article like i could just peer over
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:24.080]   the wall and i could see just the tops of their heads um i guess sometimes you can just view the
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:31.040]   cached version and that works too yeah of course there's always somebody always work around sometimes
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.520]   i don't know if paywalls are a good thing or not most companies have figured out to give you a few
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.400]   articles and then and then you pay and most people have figured out if they don't want to pay how
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:46.880]   to get around all that with things like caching so this is also the the uh euro the aggressive
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:53.520]   cookie banner no kidding i mean every single place you go and if you go to that side a million times
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:00.080]   you're gonna see it a million times i mean it's it's kind of uh like at this point i feel numbed
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:05.600]   to it and i i don't like that because the second it pops up i'm like no good okay i'm i'm kind of
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:11.440]   even reading so down trodden i don't even read it i just hit okay am i the only person that actually
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.840]   opens up the settings and and unchecks the stuff that i don't want yes part of that oh god you're
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:25.680]   definitely the only person that's okay really i love you and i applaud you that you do that but
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.480]   every time i see and not everybody not everybody offers that option most of them just say just
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.240]   click here to view what we're doing um but there are a few that says okay if you click here you can
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:42.480]   uncheck this one and uncheck that one and there's one that's like a a a mandatory one for you know
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.000]   just in case you log in they have to have that but the other stuff they let you tick off if you don't
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   in any way record people's information and you don't save their ip addresses you you know rotate
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.200]   your logs or whatever you don't really need to do it but and for instance we were told oh you have
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.520]   to do it you use you use Google Analytics we we just want to see how many people see the site in
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.920]   which parts of the site are popular i don't think that that's an invasive thing but of course i
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:13.840]   guess google gets the ip address so maybe it is anyway so we we said we have to do a cookie and i
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:20.320]   said well let's just do the the passive aggressive hostile somewhat hostile cookie that they do
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:26.160]   on tector yeah and we duplicated that which is basically look every site uses cookies get over it
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:34.720]   and we do too click here yeah and uh and and nobody's complained about it tector it's been
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:39.680]   doing it for a while but it's not because we don't we're not spying on you we're not trying to collect
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:47.360]   information so the way what is the weirdest supply chain shortage chips are obvious you know no car
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:54.080]   seat heaters and gm vehicles it's been hard to get you know what the really bad one has been the
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:34:02.800]   Microsoft's xbox series x and uh to a lesser to replace station i was going to say playstation
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:09.360]   because here recently i don't know why but i've been looking at picking up playstation again because
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:15.520]   i used to play years ago and then when i started looking it's like nobody has them available but i
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:21.760]   assumed it was all because of the supply chain it is the latest one ps5 yeah sure and that you can
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:28.880]   get it but but microsoft says we had uh chris capisella on last year the cmo of microsoft
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:34.000]   and he said last year he said this is going to go on for a while we don't we don't want to give
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.960]   people a chance to order something if we can't deliver it in any any time frame and this is where
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.160]   apple really shines they they i mean if you order a macbook pro 16 inch right now you won't get it
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.400]   until valentine's day but at least they give you a date microsoft i said why don't you do that and
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:54.000]   they said chris said we can't because we just hope apple pretty much runs the whole stack themselves
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.440]   though they they lock it in they lock it in so the weirdest supply chain in my opinion
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:11.120]   a shortage is cream cheese what did you not notice he's cake for you cannot get cream cheese to save
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.440]   your life yeah i didn't notice maybe that's because i ate a lot of bagels i have to have cream cheese
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:22.480]   well sir we are in we are in dad gun pedaluma uh the home of dairie and eggs we're going to be
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:29.040]   jibs think i've been seeing cream cheese you've been seeing it yes where do you get your cream
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.200]   cheese dude yeah i've not had any problems with the cream cheese oh my god maybe it's only in new
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   jersey and boston this is from the boston the herald supply chain shortage impacts animal goods
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   including including cream cheese schmears schmears schmears craft philadelphia cream cheese
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:58.880]   um they they actually put out an ad uh spread on spread the feeling dot com
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:06.960]   they're uh for promotional site oh boy it it says you may not be able to find filling to make a
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:16.640]   cheese cake look at the empty shelf so get any other dessert on us oh interesting oh wow oh
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:26.000]   sorry all rewards have been claimed never mind see that even the reward is a shortage of awards
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:34.880]   yes um one another thing that i've noticed is that christ if you are a fan of getting christmas trees
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:41.280]   there's fewer to choose from apparently they're really expensive uh and then if you want to get
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.360]   an artificial tree to replace it with because they're made of plastic and and everything those
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.960]   are up as like 25 over last year because of shortages so if you like christmas trees either
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:57.760]   way you go you're screwed i found that out last year we decided to to um go with the fake tree because
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.520]   normally we get yeah real tree and it was ridiculous the price you know queen peru is like go find a
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:11.120]   tree so i went okay i'll go find one and i was like hey no i'm not paying for that so i said i'll go
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:16.800]   and look for something you know an artificial tree and even that was a bit of a markup but we got one
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.840]   and i know we can at least have that for another five to ten years so we'll be out of it yeah
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.720]   cream cheese may not just be a supply chain issue it was also a ransomware issue that is the other
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.400]   one of the other big stories of the week we're going to get to that of the year i should say
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.120]   we're going to get to that after this word from smitten
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:43.600]   can you almost when i do that can you almost smell it i just kind of smell sour like i'm not
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   there but i don't know if anybody looks cooler smell in the candle than you sir i don't know
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:55.520]   what this outfit is i just i just threw on whatever i had in the closet
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:03.040]   i don't work it sir i think i like which i get to call her i gotta say yes just work it
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:10.800]   what's going on here actually i do want to talk about a brand new sponsor i am do any of you use
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:20.240]   blue land oh i'm smitten by the name i'm smitten so we look at you know the number one as far as i
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:26.320]   am concerned number one environmental thing everybody needs to address is plastic single use
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.920]   plastic it's it's a problem you know we talk about clean up the oceans remember the youtube
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:39.200]   stars raising millions of dollars to clean up the ocean the amount of plastic they removed for
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:48.800]   all that money from the ocean was replaced in 15 hours by more waste wow 15 hours the solution
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:54.160]   is not to clean up the ocean well certainly we want to do that but let's also use a little
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:00.480]   less plastic in our lives an estimated five billion plastic hands open cleaning bottles are thrown
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:08.080]   away every year i mean that's just it's a waste of of natural resources a waste of landfill this
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:15.920]   is a forever bottle from blue land and i like it so i've i've actually done it kind of the wrong way
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:21.440]   around i have some other bottles this is uh these are cleaner bottles it actually says on it what
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.960]   this is so this is the glass and mirrors is like to you know if you're glass cleaner they have a
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:35.760]   hand soap bottle they are famous for their toilet cleaning uh pallets uh we actually got the clean
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:41.360]   essentials kit so it has everything in there and then there's uh you also get a little tin to put
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:46.640]   your laundry pellets in it's great laundry soap so instead of the plastic dissolvable laundry soap
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.680]   or the big plastic gallon bottles of laundry detergent you just throw this tablet in and the waste is
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:58.560]   so much lower and it works now i have to tell you blues bluelands toilet tablet cleaner is so
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.600]   popular that it sells out so they have some right now but that's the supply chain shortage i guess
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.400]   mainly because people love it you just put it in the toilet you let it fizz bubble you clean the
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.760]   toilet you're done it's really easy i'm going to show you how this works so this is the uh i
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.800]   normally what you do is you put the tablet in and then you add water but i'm going to do it the other
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:22.880]   way around because i don't want to get up uh this is the bathroom cleaner so you spritz this you know
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:28.640]   i've got a multi-surface cleaner these are the little tablets and of course they don't send you more bottles
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:36.880]   by the way when you buy a bottle of cleaner not only the plastic most of the cost is about
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.520]   they're about 90 percent water and then just a little bit of active ingredient right so they're
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:49.120]   shipping you water which you have in plenitude at home so save the planet this is the hand soap by
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.400]   the way that'll go in here so put water in here put a tablet in there it foams up it's it's uh it's
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.800]   as good as anything it's great here's the glass and mirror cleaner so i'm going to put the tablet in
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:05.440]   here this is the little uh the little blue land palette this is all the active ingredients you get
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.440]   with any commercial cleaner but but but it's they don't ship the water they just ship the tablet
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.920]   let me do this on camera so you oh yeah good okay there you go i'm going to drop it in i'm going to
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.840]   close it up it's going to foam for a little bit you let it sit and now i have bathroom cleaner
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.680]   spritzer surface cleaner it's just great this stuff really works you buy the bottle once they call
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.800]   them their forever bottles you really fill it forever no more plastic waste the only thing you
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.600]   got to get rid of is your outdated idea that eco-friendly products are more expensive and less
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:44.960]   effective these work i can vouch for it better than some of the products i'm using better
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:51.360]   stop wasting water throwing out more plastic get blue land's revolutionary refill cleaning system
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.880]   instead blue land was founded on the belief that a cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic

[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:28.080]   smitten candle iris agave pairing lemon lavender eucalyptus oh that one that smells good i don't
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.920]   know what that is i think it's the eucalyptus from their best selling clean essentials kit that's
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.800]   what we got but once you get it then you just you know by the refills to their hand soap duo
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.960]   and plastic free plastic free laundry and dishwasher tablets blue land has something for every inch
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:49.840]   of your home and as i said backed by very popular demand Debbie loves these by the way she's been
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.440]   using them for a month the blue land toilet tablet cleaner get it before it sells out again
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:02.000]   though the the high quality forever bottles some of them are glass like this uh for because of the
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.560]   weight the hand soap foaming hand soap is glass so it's heavy so you know it sits in your counter
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.800]   some are plastic because you're going to carry them around and use them they started just 10
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.560]   dollars when you buy a kit they are reused forever but you know you can get more i guess
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.120]   even if you even if they lasted a year or two you're saving hundreds of bottles from going into the
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:25.600]   landfill and then the tablets get this started just two dollars so you're going to save money and
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.760]   this stuff works really well it's this basically it's the same ingredients it's just they don't ship

[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:30.880]   on our holiday special we are celebrating and i mean celebrating the end of 2021 the year that
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:37.840]   it would not end putting it behind as best as we can anyways in the in the quack holy cow
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:46.480]   so the cream cheese sortages also because in october shryber foods which is in wisconsin
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.280]   had to shut down during its busy peak period right before thanksgiving hanaka and christmas
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:58.960]   making cream cheese because of ransomware they have annual sales of cream cheese of five billion
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:05.440]   dollars wow goodness so it may say filly on the front but a shryber on the back i guess
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.760]   the company uh also makes cheese slices yogurt
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:16.800]   um every cream cheese producer was already struggling to keep up adequate supply so there is
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:22.240]   you know it's partly supply chain but this does not help certainly 2021
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:27.440]   and i think this is gonna be you're gonna always say the same thing in the year 2022
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.000]   was the year ransomware got worse yeah i think it's only going to get
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.400]   more and more prevalent nowadays because the tools are out there for these bad people to just
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:44.240]   do it and a lot of folks aren't as security conscious as we keep preaching to them to try
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.960]   to be security conscious uh i mean i i got i want to say four emails today and four notifications
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:58.480]   a day across four different online platforms where someone was trying to get into my account
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:05.520]   yeah wow if that was anybody else it's probably a problem right now right you have a moment
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:13.520]   okay yeah yeah exactly use two factor and i gotta give a little shout out to my grandma because i
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:19.120]   uh saw some pretty sophisticated different attempts coming at me and so i thought oh i'm
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.040]   gonna reach out to her and give her a rundown of the latest couple or yeah it was three or four
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:28.960]   and she she responded she's like oh i i'm i'm good i pretty much every time someone texts me
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.200]   who i don't know or emails me who i don't know i just get rid of it she's like i i don't i'm not
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.440]   following for any of that stuff but i thought you are awesome yes she's very
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:43.200]   wise way cooler yeah she's pretty cool she is pretty cool did you read the sunday times
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:52.160]   article this is so broke my heart tragic uh it's a scam scammers pretending to be from
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:47:01.600]   harvard university offer jobs to women in india uh it is and they you know it is just horrific
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:07.520]   and i think your grandmother i mean for a lot of the women it's like well wait a minute that's a
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:14.160]   number from Dubai not boston but what happened was they they slowly improved their attack
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:20.240]   they they bought a web domain harvard careers dot com put the harvard logo on it
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:26.800]   um it got more and more sophisticated they got harvard letterhead they got the names of deans
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:32.560]   and they pretended to be the deans when they called and they actually tricked one of india's best
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:37.440]   known news broadcaster she'd been 20 years in the business audience of a billion people
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.600]   uh but she was getting tired of the political situation and and just was she was burned job
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.040]   burnout and she thought she had this great job offer paying a hundred fifty one thousand dollars
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:54.480]   to teach at harvard in boston she thought it was real she quit her job she tweeted i'm going to boston
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:59.920]   it was all a scam oh my god this is oh that's broke my heart dang it
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:06.560]   but the you know i mean on the one hand you could say well you know mikas grandmother wouldn't have
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.920]   fallen for that but but the problem is they were targeted all in every every case the journalists
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:19.920]   were anti-modi anti-nationalist reporters they had written critical stories about the government
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.640]   so no one knows you know they gave them passports and all sorts of details but none of that stuff
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:30.560]   was every use so no one knows but the suspicion is that this is maybe the the government or or
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:35.440]   sophisticated it's something like that where they're yeah it is sophisticated and they're and they're
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.160]   you know they're trying to get these people out of the country to shut them up
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:44.560]   yeah there's that a little criticism to harvard for not doing anything about it even though they
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:51.360]   had been warned about it uh just uh just a tragic uh story but it just shows you know look these scams
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:58.160]   have always happened but the internet makes it's you know a lot easier right okay i'm
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.240]   making a lot easier when we go on the case of ignorance well hold on go ahead mica
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:09.040]   i was just going to say the the sophistication continues to increase in some ways and that's
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:15.360]   what's troubling to me because sophistication typically requires money and so it you do wonder
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.440]   you know how many of these people are they actually scamming in order to be able to make this amount
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:25.040]   of money to continue to justify their continuing expenditures to make this thing as sophisticated
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.080]   as it as it is that's the part that's quite terrifying and we talked about bogosity filters
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:34.480]   before these are things that would not trip off your bogosity filter you wouldn't think it was
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:43.200]   bogus because it's so sophisticated yeah um the times hired uh security experts all sorts of
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.880]   forensics people brought them in and they never were able to uncover who it was that's the other
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:56.640]   thing is it's possible to really do this completely anonymously uh or the armotive for it uh and and
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.920]   all of the all of the you know the trip wires like gmail and so forth that should have warned her did
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:11.440]   not um she's she by the way she had quit her job uh she did not have a job at harvard she's
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.680]   according to the times quietly beginning to rebuild her life teaching public policies at an
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:22.000]   indian university and writing for a newspaper but she keeps asking herself the same question how
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.520]   could i be so stupid at you what are the ask a question well i was going to say i'm probably
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:33.040]   showing my ignorance but you mentioned harvard is getting grief for not stepping in to do something
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:38.240]   about this what exactly could they have done considering that anybody and everybody can
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:44.960]   download a dad gum jpeg from the website and build a website from whatever domain builder
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:51.760]   dot com within a few minutes and just pod the stuff office as a legitimate service and site so
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:58.640]   what exactly yes exactly the fault but uh according to the times harvard fiercely protects its trademark
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.840]   they use software to detect websites that pretend to be from harvard they never uh they don't they
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.200]   haven't seen this yeah they haven't said whether they knew about harvard career dot com or did anything
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:14.720]   about it uh one of the early victims of the scam called harvard and alerted them to this scam
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.160]   but apparently they did nothing to notify to let people know they didn't look for other
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.720]   victims so i don't know how much of his harvard's fault you're right it could happen to anybody
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:28.080]   yeah but even if there were cease and desist sent out or whatever you think that was going to
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:34.640]   stop anything no probably not i guess they really the only moral of this is is uh you know be like
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:41.200]   mike's grandma yeah and i i mean so one of my grandma's friends she was using that kind of as a as a
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   comparison uh unfortunately was taken by uh a scam and she um was kind of talking to
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:54.880]   uh the friend because i've always been this way with my grandma very encouraging of the fact that
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:02.000]   if something like this happens you should not take that time to to blame yourself like it is easy
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.640]   and you do fall into that pattern of like ah how did i fall for that and her friend was feeling that
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:12.720]   same way and you know my grandma was talking to her she's like what what my grandson talks about is how
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:19.040]   technology should work in our favor and should have all of these things in place and so when those
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.720]   kinds of things happen it's the technology that's at fault and the person who is doing this to you
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:30.160]   who's at fault it's not your you know it's it's not something that you should uh spend the time just
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.240]   you know beating yourself up over oh i should have picked that up i should have picked this up it's
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:41.280]   hard to realize those things it's hard to pick up on that and it does it kills me you know for
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:48.000]   people to be blaming themselves and feeling so uh kind of lost after that happens given the fact
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.320]   that there are any number of people who could have fallen for that it's not something that's just
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:59.360]   so simple to to pick out so yeah i just encourage people don't don't beat yourself up too much
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.840]   because in those situations someone is trying very hard and playing on all the right psychological
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:09.360]   things to get you to do the thing that they want you to do they've figured it out they've
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.120]   cracked the code that's that's one thing that that kind of comes to mind when i'm when i'm hearing
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:19.440]   you talk about this mica is that like there has never been it feels and maybe it feels this way
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.120]   because we're in the midst of it right now but when we're talking about ransomware we're talking
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:30.000]   about hacks we're talking about all of these different aspects of security online it feels now
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.360]   more than ever that there is that that the attackers are far ahead of the people who are
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:42.560]   protecting and and and trying to you know lock the doors before they get in it seems like the people
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:50.080]   who are who are hacking or doing the ransomware attacks they know so much more than i think those
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:56.400]   threat actors in the past seem to know there there's there's some distance now between between the
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   people who would stop this from happening and the people who are just like you know what it's
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:05.760]   easier than ever the stakes are as high as they've ever been like it's it's overwhelming so of
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.480]   course someone shouldn't blame themselves if they fall for it it's that sophisticated now
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:17.040]   yeah just tragic and i guess uh it's our job really uh to to spread the word as much as possible and
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:24.160]   to tell people you know yeah well and obviously that's working if like if like if like is grandma
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:30.800]   is is so educated at least is working for you know for some um probably probably people are more
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.520]   educated about this stuff now than they were 10 years ago or 15 years ago you know with the email
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.960]   scams that were happening then and everything was so fresh and new were a lot more knowledgeable
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:46.960]   about the possibility of these threats now it's just the stakes are a whole lot higher yeah it makes
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:52.720]   uh i appreciate the fact that you said mr. Fort you hate to tell people to be cynical because i think
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:55:01.920]   about a situation at a one of my previous employers where um a co-worker got an email from one of the
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:09.360]   you know upper management people about xyz report because that's what they normally get and of course
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:15.120]   when they went to open that spreadsheet it was a problem you know but at the same time we can't fault
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:22.400]   this person that they were just doing their job um it's you know they're just doing what they do
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:27.680]   all day long they know that their superior is going to send over some type of report on a regular
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:33.280]   basis and talk about it and you just open it up and sadly some mess happened and you know
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:39.760]   somewhat of the blame goes to companies like uh google and microsoft because their software has
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:46.640]   been so horrific all those holes i can't remember what the last count uh we'll have to do it tally on
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:53.120]   security now next year uh on zero day flaws in google's chrome but it was more than 13 a year
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:56:01.360]   more than one a month more than one a month and uh microsoft's 2021 you know i i'm sure microsoft
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:07.680]   really really wanted to uh to be able to say hey you know we've really locked down our operating
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:14.720]   system but routinely on patch tuesday's there's more than a hundred flaws being fixed every
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:20.880]   every month tuesday and that doesn't even bring up the big ones which which are the exchange
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:28.160]   server vulnerabilities uh you know the solar winds flaw uh there's some there've been some really
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:36.880]   nasty ones on june eight microsoft patched zero six zero days six of them wow then there was the
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:43.040]   prince pauler vulnerability for nightmare the gimmer yeah it mica has to listen to security now
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:48.240]   he produces a show so you know he was nothing but every week oh and there's another one oh here's
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:55.120]   another one where's another one prince june produces uh security now but i remember being in uh for
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:00.480]   one episode i i think that's what it was you host yeah you two are out and so i end up covering
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:05.120]   print nightmare that's what it was yeah wait they're telling you the microsoft solution at the time
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:11.440]   was you just can't print for right now yeah you just uh don't you just don't uh that would be a bad
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:20.240]   idea um best tech support ever i it's one of those things where you know i've always said
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.840]   okay fine if microsoft fixing flaws from older software that software has problems and
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:31.760]   fixes them you should fix them when you find them that's fine but if they're fixing problems introduced
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:38.640]   newly then you need to really look at your process yeah and see what you're doing that you keep
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:44.160]   making these same mistakes over and over and over again of course we're you can't even really say
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:49.440]   we're looking back at 2021 when we talk about the worst flaw of 2021 which is probably the worst
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:56.080]   security flaw of all time we we're just starting to see the fallout of the log for jay problem this
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:02.480]   is a java based logger that's used on pretty much every server everywhere apple uses it microsoft
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:07.680]   uses it's from the apache foundation uh every amazon uses everybody uses it and it is
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:16.320]   not merely a bad zero day it's it's it's trivial to exploit so i could do it which is
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:22.960]   not saying i mean if i anybody could do it uh it's just putting a little string in your browser
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   and suddenly you have full access to whatever is behind the wall on that server that's horrific
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.520]   and the problem is oh it'll be patched probably uh you know the people who do it it's an open source
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:38.240]   project volunteers do it they worked very hard over Thanksgiving weekend to fix it by the way
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.400]   there've been three now and there probably more because they keep finding more problems with it but
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:47.600]   they keep fixing them but sorry did you say volunteers why was it it's not a fallen it's an
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:56.320]   open source project oh okay it's all unpaid volunteers doing this that's the other dirty little secret
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:02.320]   of enterprise software these companies are making billions but often their entire stack relies on
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   a open source project maintained by some guy in turkey you know it's just it's not uh it's a very
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:16.000]   weird model uh in any event um uh even if they fix it we don't know how many systems have been
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.600]   compromised and we may never know because these guys are going in there and a lot of marination
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.680]   states we know china's been doing it and they're just sitting there and they said one of my favorite
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:28.560]   analogies of yours regarding this was the fact that if okay it's this is getting patched but
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:34.000]   unfortunately the bad guys are already already in already in you know you're closing the gate
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.720]   behind them so this was an absolute nightmare year uh for security reval that that was the one
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:46.880]   bright side reval which is the worst horrible ransomware attack gang uh and you're gonna talk
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:52.160]   about this is one of your story picks so i won't i won't uh give away all the story but but the
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:58.640]   good news is we got them i think we got them so they finally did something so horrific
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:05.920]   it's such a horrific infrastructure attack that the fbi uh police from all over the world
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.720]   we they tracked him down and i think they've shut him down forever uh and arrested a number of
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.560]   affiliates and maybe even one of the one of the guys behind reval uh reval was ransomware as a
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:24.080]   service which is another modern concept uh these guys set up a website where you could go and say
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.760]   yeah uh i would like to uh i would like to buy some ransomware please i'll give you 10 percent
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.520]   of what i make and then so they don't have to know anything about ransomware attacks they just
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:39.200]   have to get in put it on the system they collect the money they pay reval their 10 percent and uh they
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.200]   move on and so there were many many affiliates uh doing this so it's not just cream cheese anymore
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:53.200]   uh no it's definitely more than clinches another story another story this year a fun story
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:01:02.560]   billionaires in space and you need to put that in air quotes sir space yes sort of spacesh
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:10.640]   and low earth orbit spaceshish so what was the chronology of this did did start with Bezo saying
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:18.400]   he was going to go up in his penis rocket it's a good question in a text message and then uh
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:25.200]   Richard Branson uh said no i'm going to go up in mine first in virgin galactic
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.640]   and then uh elon he kind of told them saying i'm not going up at all
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:38.080]   i'm just sending people to the space station and the moon he says i got bigger fish to
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:44.000]   get bigger fish to pry yeah that'll show you then william shatner went up which i think was a
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.840]   very smooth PR move because because cap and kurtil is in tears you know he was like so moved
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:02:01.120]   you know i i saw um shatners uh one of his talks i listened to adam corolla and i know he's very
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.200]   controversial but his his podcast is pretty funny he's a good friend i like adam a lot
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:12.880]   and he had shatner on um after his his you know space ride and whatnot and just the way
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:19.360]   shatner talked about it in in in that interview it was just unbelievable because before you know
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.680]   leading up to that they were just having general conversation he has this specific tone and he's
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:29.200]   he's a big ham you know he's he's an actor you know but when he started to talk about that
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:35.520]   experience and just how moving it was and just how you know he started to to reconsider you know
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:40.880]   what really matters in life and it was it was quite it was quite moving if you can i highly
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.000]   recommend y'all look that up and listen to it it was really well of course they made a documentary
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.120]   that's the other thing on amazon prime you can watch shatner in space the documentary
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:57.120]   but do you get the full point like shatner speech yeah probably because it didn't
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:05.440]   bazos cut him off yes cut him off yeah he carried more he was in the middle yeah he said stop talking
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:11.760]   campaign drink champagne and then continued but i mean it was really sweet i mean hearing
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.200]   hearing shatner talk about it you could tell i mean we all know shatner for you know star trek and
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.960]   and his entire career he's been very visible around the for that franchise and you know have
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:30.880]   the association with space but to see someone of his his background actually go you know as about
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.920]   as close as most of us will ever get to space and come back and have just i mean they were
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:42.400]   beautiful words like you could tell he was moved emotionally through that experience and uh that
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.960]   was that was a highlight definitely watching that put a smile on my face i love it because youtube
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:52.560]   comments which pull no punch the very first comment on the teaser for shatner in spaces i kind of
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:56.960]   hope we get that clip where shatner was trying to tell jeff bazos how extraordinary he felt and
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:05.680]   jeff just left in mid-comer's station yeah but it's true we all saw it's a deal jennison
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.280]   some is somebody in the chat room said you know you got to say billionaires in space because
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.400]   billionaires in low earth orbit is not you know just doesn't really quite not quite billionaires
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.680]   in the stratosphere it's not just have the same doesn't have the same thing uh no we're
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:26.080]   billionaires closer to space than you'll probably ever be true although the musical i think nasa
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:32.320]   says we're not going to give wings to everybody stop it yeah i saw the f_a_a_ uh
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.040]   was the f_a_a_ right yeah i said no we only have so many astronaut wings sorry
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:46.240]   no more commercial astronaut wings too many launching says the federal aviation administration
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:54.320]   it was cool the one bazos went up he also brought uh that was really what was her name the uh the
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   older woman who tried really hard to be an astronaut but in those days nasa didn't have
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:07.920]   female astronauts so she got to train people and she was a flying teacher but uh she finally did get
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.880]   at least space adjacent with the blue origin so that was that was a very nice
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:19.520]   story i'm sorry i forgot her name michael strand's gone up now the football and good morning america
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.120]   star um i mean is there is there any reason they shouldn't be going to space if they have
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:32.640]   the means to do it there isn't there's a fundamental issue okay going on uh environmental issues with
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.320]   everything today i think that's true i um i you know i shouldn't be yes that's because we don't
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:43.440]   have much time before i was a guy and all these fun thank you very much it was wallie fun i think
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:51.760]   i read that the amount of uh um pollution put into the uh atmosphere by that rocket is like the
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.880]   equivalent of all of jeff bazos's private jeff flights for a year i think it's oh wow something on
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:04.880]   that wall wow interesting that's yeah i know that i did agree that was one of the trolling uh
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:11.120]   tweets that elan musk said is you know our rockets do not do not pollute in the same to nearly the same
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:17.680]   degree it's possible to do this with a considerably less pollution um but i i'm not in the next day
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.480]   yeah i've uh we've i've talked about with rod pile on the radio show i have to have to let's see
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:31.760]   oh okay fact check thank you morning to us a today jeff bazos's new shepherd rocket launch
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:40.080]   did not oh behind a firewall behind a pain dart it did not something here of the paywall did not
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.600]   emit carbon okay okay so there you go what did it admit image we don't know
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:51.920]   uh i had seen this facebook post that said it put hundreds of tons of carbon docs that that is
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:07:00.960]   actually us today said it did not um sorry leo did you say a facebook post yeah uh yeah never
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.800]   mind i forgot i saw that on facebook uh space x's falcon rockets use kerosene
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:14.240]   uh in fact the blue origin uses a liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen combination blue engine three
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:20.640]   that is not does not emit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or during the launch
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:28.720]   oh yeah shatner was talking about hydrogen yes uh commentary and how he was just a bit nervous
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.360]   because he's like hydrogen really he blowing up he was a little nervous it's not completely neutral
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:43.120]   um the amount of water it puts in the air is apparently problematic but yeah i know you will
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.640]   think that's a good thing but a water water vapor emissions from individual launches can
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:55.360]   notably impact the mesosphere and ionosphere but do not contribute to carbon emissions so that's
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:01.920]   there you go it's kind of amazing how violent uh if you if you make water uh as opposed to just
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.040]   existing as h2o if you actually take hydrogen and oxygen and combine them to make water it's
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:12.320]   actually quite a violent reaction so i'm not surprised that they can harness that to propel something
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.320]   uh billionaires in space i guess that's all there is to say about that
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:25.680]   billionaires near space i did enjoy that if you had a quarter of a million you could do it
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:32.000]   civilians yeah i did enjoy that they paid oh the civilians in the um in space
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.880]   space launch yeah the inspiration for yeah that was very cool i did enjoy that yeah those are
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.480]   regular people with the essential and they orbited so yeah no that's that's pretty darn cool this
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:49.360]   was the year that uh jeff Bezos did step down as CEO as amazon uh anti jassy taking over jassee a
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:55.600]   close lieutenant who had run the very very profitable amazon web services division and as far as i
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.800]   know it's been good one of the first things that happened when jassee uh took the helm is amazon
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:06.960]   announced uh it was going to raise the minimum wage um they did a number of things that were a
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:15.040]   little bit i think probably more uh kinder to the uh warehouse uh staff so uh but i haven't seen any
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.920]   big changes in amazon it's certainly been very well they still have some work to do a little work
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:25.280]   so yeah a little bit of course the tornado tragedy yeah no one word yeah yeah
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:34.160]   um jacked or see step down this year too let's not forget the CEO of twer one of the founders
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:39.360]   one of the founders the guy with the beard and the nose ring you know him oh jacked or see he's going
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:45.280]   to i thought he ran square not twitter he is running square now and except it's not square anymore
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:49.920]   this was also the year that a number of companies decided to change their names
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:56.000]   square changed his name to block because uh they're all over the blockchain and now it's getting
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.080]   sued by h&r block because h&r block oops he's trying to claim trademark on that so that's
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.960]   interesting yeah uh and then uh facebook changes name to meta that's either the biggest story of
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:16.720]   the year or non-story i can't decide yeah totally right i mean when they spoke had a really rough
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:25.280]   year and uh and all entirely brought on by its own self and so it is interesting while the name
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:32.000]   change itself is maybe a non-story the idea that it's changed its name uh for the metaverse or that
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.320]   it changed its name to try to get away from all of the stuff that facebook had to deal with this year
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:43.840]   that part is a big big story i mean it uh the the facebook papers and you know testifying before
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.400]   congress huge all sorts of stuff going on there frances hogging the where whistle blower who
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:54.000]   released a lot of documentation showing that facebook probably knew and probably decided not
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.520]   to do anything about the damage that they were doing not just politically but to young girls
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:06.880]   psyches uh on on instagram uh she i think the the kind of the quote that i will remember is
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:13.680]   facebook values profits over people which is not a good thing for company that really kind of
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:21.840]   pretends that it's all about connecting people connecting people at people's expense is facebook's
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:29.680]   yeah yeah and we'll take that thank you very much um i i i think that we might have said at the
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:34.400]   beginning of the year that the tech lash was going to be a big story congress the ftc
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:42.160]   uh the eu in all investigating some fairly hefty fines coming out of the eu now uh to some of the
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:47.840]   big tech companies but i also think we're starting to see that that was a lot of sound and fury
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:53.600]   but i don't know if much is going to happen you know what do you guys think well i mean it keeps
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:12:00.480]   going it we keep seeing the things that make us uh believe that there might possibly be some
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.080]   changes right like uh the ceo's going to congress testifying blah blah but each time it happens
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:13.360]   there seems to be no resolution there seems to be no there there it's it all seems to be kind of
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.920]   staged for show and so if there is change that that's going to come about from regulation and uh you
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.200]   know these these folks going to to dc and having to testify on the behalf of their companies we
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.680]   certainly haven't seen it yet there haven't been many clues this year uh let's just say that that
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.480]   make me feel very positive about that mr howl as long as there is lobbyists
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.360]   ain't that going to change sir
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.720]   well and that's an interesting point because it's certain i think it's almost certain that
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:50.560]   congress will do nothing not just because of lobbyists but let's not forget that politicians
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.840]   love to advertise on facebook you know at the same time as their critical of facebook they benefit
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.680]   from all this data collection they use it so there i think they're maybe somewhat less likely to try
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.320]   to shut it down i think they're going to make a lot of noise i doubt much will happen now on the
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:14.000]   other hand uh the ftc and lina con the new chairman of the ftc it has more teeth and is more aggressive
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.080]   than than i can remember the ftc being even back in the bad era for microsoft at the late 90s when
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:26.240]   they got in trouble with the doj i feel like the lina con in fact google asked a court to force her
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:33.680]   to recuse herself because she'd written such anti google and anti big tech pieces as a as a professor
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:39.440]   uh the courts by the way rejected that um she is very much going after big tech
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:45.600]   now can the ftc make a difference can they do something without the support of congress
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:53.280]   and you know i my suspicion is that the the current administration doesn't have a lot of teeth
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:59.920]   because of a split congress uh or split senate i just wonder how much she's going to get done but
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.680]   she's it's pretty clear she's going to try and it's also clear google is very afraid
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.120]   uh there was something you mentioned on the tech guy that's stuck with me though that makes me
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:15.360]   think that there will be regulations that take place but they are championed by those big tech
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:20.800]   companies because of how they snuff out smaller tech companies who can't hold up to those
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.360]   regulations that are needed what was that that you meant there's a time for it yeah regulatory cap
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:31.600]   capture is the term that javis always uses but the but you you know this is going on because i don't
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.880]   maybe you i will i watch a lot of football and there's on every nfl game there's at least one or
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:48.880]   two facebook or sorry meta ads featuring often uh meta content uh i don't know overseers you know
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:54.320]   kind of people on the ground who are managing the content of facebook who say we need a law
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:01.200]   congress ought to pass a law uh we can't do it alone and and it sounds like facebook's on the
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:06.480]   side of the angel saying yeah yeah you know we ought to be regulated regulate us but but really
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.040]   it's important to understand that fate any regulation congress comes up with facebook will
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.680]   be well positioned as big as they are as rich as they are as powerful as they are to handle but we'll
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.840]   also have the very strong effect of stifling any competition because nobody coming up will have
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.360]   the resources to deal with these requirements so it's pretty obvious when facebook's law being
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.680]   congress to pass a law regulating tech that it is somehow for their benefit and i think that's how
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:39.360]   it's called regulatory capture and facebook is going to continue to make so much money because
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.800]   the users are not going to go away that's that's their trust the bottom line they're not going to
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:50.000]   go away people can hate facebook and everything that it stands for but for whatever reason they're
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.160]   not going to drop it even if it's just to stay in touch with but grandkids but remember you know
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.280]   you might have said the same thing about my space right and facebook completely destroyed my space
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.560]   isn't it possible that somebody would come along and do the same to facebook i don't know i i
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.000]   have no reason to believe that's going to happen because of how big facebook has gotten um when you
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.520]   compare to two um my my space edits it had barely got a toe in yeah right yeah yeah it was never the
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.600]   backbone of the internet in a higher country right uh faces a bunch of services yeah i mean the
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:29.360]   scale is just completely different now my space was so early on it was it was really part of of
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:35.280]   defining what social media actually was yeah so it was it was almost inevitable that on my space
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.000]   that early on i mean i suppose i suppose it could have been we were there first therefore we ran
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.040]   supreme forever but um it's almost like they were they they were the training grounds for the rest of
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.240]   the social networks that came after them facebook they walked so facebook could run yes there
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:58.960]   right there i know i mean google had the resolences and still could do wave or whatever it was you know
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:05.680]   um plus i mean google had plenty of money plenty of engineer and talent all of the network it feels
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:13.360]   like facebook is much more single-minded that google just couldn't it was so add they are a bit
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:19.440]   add that i think that's exactly it had they put all the same if the you know the the business term is
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.760]   put all that wood behind a single arrow had they put all the energy that they put in all these
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.480]   different things including april fools jokes into dominating the world they might have done it
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:35.680]   uh google plus was great but they just couldn't keep you know pay attention meanwhile facebook
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:43.920]   laser-like right yeah they know what they want they go get it yeah at all costs yeah and i don't think
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:50.800]   i don't think they're at all thrown by what congress is throwing out and maybe the metaverse is going
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:56.080]   to be a distraction for them let's take a break that's the next topic of conversation the metaverse
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:04.720]   here it comes or does it or is it just second-city reducks i don't know uh our show today brought to
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.480]   you by noom i want to talk about noom a little bit another great product that we use
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.440]   i started doing it early this year because of the covid-19 actually is more like 20 for me
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:20.960]   lisa said i'm going to do this to support you and now she's surprised me she loves noom she
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.800]   didn't have as much to lose but she's always had trouble with that last few pounds and i'm sure
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:31.120]   a you know a lot of people like me who if i see food i got to stuff it in my mouth i just kind of
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:38.480]   complete unconscious eater and i think there are people like lisa who is very you know careful and
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:43.200]   smart about what she eats but was just having trouble with that last few pounds and noom work
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:50.800]   for us both because i'm going to say this i don't know if this is their motto but because i don't
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:59.600]   it's not a diet noom is education noom is teaching you better habits for better long-term results
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:05.920]   you're in it for the long haul and i just love it i mean i've been on every diet ever i've done
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:09.840]   them all and you know that and i've talked about them before i don't know if i want to live on
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.920]   kale for the rest of my life noom doesn't make that distinction i'll never forget when i first
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.640]   started on noom i had to have a hot dog i had a hot dog and i wrote to my coach you get a personal
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.720]   coach t is my coach idea i wrote to my coach i said i had a hot dog she said what's wrong with
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:29.120]   that there's nothing wrong with that did you log it yeah that's great in fact noom because you get
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.920]   lessons it's about ten minutes a day of of lessons uh food logging it's very simple very
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:39.840]   easy to do every once in a while they surprise you they say time for some fun take a day off
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:48.000]   i've never had a diet do that it's awesome instead of making you feel guilt regret feeling bad about
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.920]   yourself feeling thwarted noom empowers you to keep going if there's a single secret to noom that's
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:20:00.560]   it there aren't strict rules noom gives you knowledge so that you understand what you're doing you
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:05.200]   understand i i'm a fogg eater i come home i stuff my mouth i don't even think about what i'm eating i
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.440]   don't even taste it one of the things that great lesson we did with noom Lisa and i both still do
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:15.040]   this we love it is we turn off the tv we put away the phones we put away any any distractions and we
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.920]   take one bite put down our forks and really taste the food and i can't tell you what a difference
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:25.680]   that makes it all comes from noom they use a cognitive behavioral approach you focus on the
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:30.720]   why instead of the what to change your relationship with eating that's it your relationship with food
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:38.560]   has changed but it's for it's important to everybody's journey is different nobody's nobody's perfect
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:43.920]   noom is not about perfection it's just about progress uh and it's about eliminating the pressure
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:49.200]   eliminating the good the bad uh fitting yourself to other people's expectations
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:55.520]   having the you know feeling that that you know i can't do it and then with noom you find things
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:01.440]   that work for you and you go this is it i can do it no one wants to be in a strict diet do two
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:06.080]   a days at the gym drink these weird tees no one wants to do that and that's not noom instead of
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.600]   trying to cram your life into somebody else's idea of health trying noom it's a tested psychology-based
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:17.840]   approach to find a healthier balance that's moldable to your life it really works 75% of
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:23.120]   noom users finish the program they go all the way through and by the way even when you're finished

[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:34.320]   with the program keep the weight off for at least a year i'm just look at Lisa and i just go wow
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:39.280]   it's amazing she never thought she'd get that last couple of pounds you don't need rules to
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.680]   lose weight just the knowledge and wisdom to empower you to build a smarter more sustainable
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:49.680]   habit around food noom weights cognitive behavioral approach lets you better understand your
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.240]   relationship with food how to be more mindful of your habits gives you the knowledge and support
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.280]   you need for a long lasting change it's what you want trust me this is what you want with noom

[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:44.080]   and i'd seen him many many times when we finally decided to do it i thought you know maybe this is

[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:17.520]   trope you you put on the headset or you jack in the back of your head you're suddenly in the meta
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:22.480]   verse a world that is by the way i have to point out in every single science fiction novel whether
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:29.120]   it's snow crash or cyberpunk or ready player one and every single one of them when you're jacking
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:36.240]   in it's because the real world is so awful so dystopian you don't want to be in it right
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:41.280]   uh is that our future sir this world is just going to become a
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:47.040]   our proffle awful place well i don't think that's the right answer but
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:53.920]   now maybe it is i don't know are you all what are you and are you looking for you you like the
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:24:03.280]   the VR stuff right yeah i dig the VR stuff but i think the way uh mr future guest host mr daniel
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:09.920]   sware has put it in his franchise the the demon franchise i think that is something that's
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:17.040]   way more useful and that was just the wearing advisors that gave you more of a um uh not VR
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:23.600]   what is it the AR was augmented AR yes i love this vianon VR you're right you know i think that's
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:29.120]   the way to go because you're not totally jacked into something but you are out in the real world
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.880]   and you're able to see different things in the meta space you know that that may be useful for
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:39.280]   you out there not granted there are some security implications with that because i don't want to
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.960]   look at strange person coming down the street and see their credit history and things like that but
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:50.720]   it it would be nice that if someone walks up to me and say hey are you ant from twit i could
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:58.640]   look at him and make sure they're not some weirdo or you could say oh it's uh it's you mesh potato
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:05.680]   how are you? yeah zoos asking uh yeah that's actually one of the best parts at the very beginning of
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.440]   demon they're walking around you you can see people's reputation score floating around their
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.400]   head but you're still in the real world you're still in the real world it's just additional
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.760]   information that's mixed reality or augmented reality that's what apparently they say apple's
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:23.680]   working on microsoft has the hollow lens which is kind of a not very satisfactory experience of the
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:30.080]   same thing i just don't like the idea especially in this time that we're in with the pandemic and
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:37.600]   people having to be locked in um i don't like the idea of of just giving more of a reason to stay
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.720]   locked in and isolate it from people even if you're in your in your house you're now isolating
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:49.760]   yourself from people within your house because you're in this virtual environment kind of thing
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:55.600]   you know it's i got boys that that like to play around their phones or play video games or or
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:00.400]   what have you and every now and then i have to tell them put it down i don't care if you didn't
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.800]   got nothing to say to me you need to come out of that room and get some air and be around other
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:12.160]   people you know i i think it's better for the for the psyche i don't get the feeling that
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:19.200]   mark succuburg's vision of the metaverse is augment in reality it really is more like that old snow
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:26.000]   crash where you're in a new it definitely lives more vr because i mean i can be transported to a
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.040]   whole different world where he's got control of the advertising to right but i mean genuinely that
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.080]   that's what it is and what's what's fascinating about all of this i feel is the psychology behind
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:45.360]   it because there is you know what ant's talking about there is a lot to suggest that human physical
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:52.400]   touch is something that psychologically we need and you the those interactions and particular the
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:27:00.400]   physical touch interactions are starved in vr however how our brains are not very good at the
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.440]   base level of of differentiating between real and imagined and there are a lot of really
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.720]   interesting studies surrounding that they won't go into uh but the point is you can
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:16.640]   be taken away to another world where you are communicating with other people and outside of
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:22.240]   human physical touch which i do think it's very important you can have those same interactions
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:28.320]   experiences and the psychological benefit of being around other people in this virtual space
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.720]   if your brain is capable of if your brain you know sort of falls into that and you kind of get
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:40.560]   taken out of yourself so i agree that that uh there are the pros and cons of of people maybe
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.920]   having an issue where they do get so sucked into it because it is like real life in some ways and
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:51.840]   will continue to get better um and i'm certainly more of a proponent of of ar over vr myself as well
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:28:00.400]   but have you ever i'm sure you guys have stood on in virtual reality uh what looks like a very
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.440]   tall building right on the edge and you're looking down and your heart starts pounding is awesome
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:12.880]   it's real awesome feeling yeah even the kind of weak you know vr we have the low res vr we have now
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:18.320]   is capable of tricking you into feeling like you're really there imagine you know a few years hence
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:26.240]   uh there's an embodiment there uh that you feel in that scenario hearing what you were saying and
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:32.160]   as far as kind of like the disconnectedness and needing like reality and real touch especially
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:37.200]   and and like you said it as well mica in the last couple of years where we've been so locked down
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:44.000]   i like i would i would uh pose the counterpoint to that which was that during the true lockdown
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.040]   where like no one was going anywhere like right things have eased up now but when things were
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:55.120]   really locked down and we were starved for like getting out and doing something i was thinking
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.160]   by lucky stars that we had a couple of head headsets here because me and my girls could throw on the
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.720]   headsets and we could go to a virtual bowling alley together and it was like we were bowling
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.720]   together you know i i just happened to be in this room and my other daughter was in our living room
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.040]   and the other daughter was in the den but we were all in the same place together and it really
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.040]   it really was like we were in a place hanging out together it was so much fun but that's the
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:23.360]   difference so we needed when we couldn't have it but that's the difference you actually
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:29.680]   came together and said hey let's put the headsets on and and then sure when it was done you took
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:35.280]   them off and y'all came back together yeah yeah no question yeah right yes i'm an introvert i
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:43.040]   i love just chilling by myself but i do have to make sure i spend time with family and and yeah
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.480]   you know because this is healthy you know it's it's the right thing to do
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:52.160]   were you uh wearing the quest to is that what you're using Jason when you're doing that
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:57.600]   yeah the quest the actually it was three different three different systems quest quest two and the
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:03.520]   PlayStation VR okay so and were they all roughly equal in experience or was there one that you
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:09.280]   liked but in the other i mean the PlayStation VR is definitely the lowest tier like that's the
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:15.280]   one i always end up in and the girl's quest dad's life really you sacrifice is that it
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:21.520]   because the controller mechanism is way different right it's not nearly as intuitive as it is on
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:25.680]   the on the quest and quest two but then i prefer the quest to just because it's a higher resolution
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.640]   it's just um it's maybe a little less comfortable but yeah they're they're both pretty similar in my
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:36.960]   opinion so i i got to be a part of horizon worlds while it was still in invite only stage and try
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:42.640]   that out uh which is Facebook's like first take on the metaverse and it was a really fascinating
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:50.560]   experience building my own little world but then also going to this shared space there was a VC
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:54.080]   over in the corner talking with somebody else about investments that he just made and was like
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.840]   i'm staying very far away from that that sounds like boring but there's there's a there's a
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:03.120]   sounds like clubhouse right is the other person going around saying hi to everybody but then a
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:08.880]   facebook person like community you know guru or whatever came into the space and she was walking
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:15.280]   around and was telling people about some different kind of hidden easter eggs and so you saw all of
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:20.240]   these people kind of having this delightful moment of learning new ways to interact and make
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:25.520]   sparkles appear above your head and all sorts of stuff and i was kind of listening in a little
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:31.920]   bit from a distance while i was playing with a paper airplane game standing atop and kind of
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:36.880]   looking down on this whole group of people and i was able to do this all from my real parties
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:42.320]   yeah it was it was it was really like a real part it was around halloween too so this one world
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.000]   would take you to different worlds that people built where they were halloween themed things so
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.640]   there was like a haunted house and some games where you tried to get rid of ghosts and different
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.560]   people could play and there was a huge scoreboard in the background where everybody could see their
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.520]   score and compete against one another and i didn't have to move from a spot which was a pretty cool
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:06.320]   thing to be able to do again while you're in lockdown so i do see some value to this i think
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:11.840]   the big thing is adoption and whether or not that is going to take place i'm actually not worried
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:17.040]   about adoption because i look at how people have taken a VR and that and that they really love it
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.720]   i mean there's a certain percentage of people who will always be nauseated by it i think i'm in
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.760]   that group yeah but yeah i struggle with the latency for the yeah maybe it maybe it'll get better and
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:32.240]   won't be an issue but you just described sounds pretty cool mike i guess the question is do we
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:39.440]   have to be in meat space to relate to one another or can we really have a genuine experience with
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:45.440]   one another in a virtual space do you think we can right i think that there's so i'll tell you i think
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:52.320]   two things one this is still in the way that it's working now is relatively new and so there will
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:57.920]   be a number of studies that go out but the studies that we have seen i think in psychology today even
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:05.760]   there was a piece about people um going through therapy and the empathy that can take place in
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:12.720]   virtual space but i will say i joined horizon worlds and i've got this issue of everywhere i play
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:18.640]   everywhere i create an online persona i always use my name at mikeasargent on everything and in
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:24.960]   horizon worlds after i'd already created my character my avatar whatever i thought oh man i feel kind
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:29.360]   of bare and open to the world i kind of wish i would have just come up with a different username
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.080]   as i'm walking around my name's above my head and that was a weird experience for me because i'm on
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:39.760]   camera a lot of the time i talked to people talking front of people fascinating to feel enough exposed
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:44.560]   in this virtual space was kind of an interesting thing that i was not expecting to feel uh and it
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.920]   kind of changed how i i interacted with it i had to get comfortable turning off my mute switch for
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.040]   the microphone and start to participate in the conversations that were taking place around me
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:01.520]   so yeah i do think that um we can i i want to go with the word supplement i don't want to go
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.240]   with replace but supplement some of those interactions we have elsewhere because we're trying to do
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:13.120]   that now just in in text based and in video conversations and so the closer we can get to the real thing
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:19.520]   the more our brains can sort of give way with that uh suspension of disbelief and i think the more
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:25.200]   than it will work do you i definitely agree with supplementing it because i think about every
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:32.000]   dad gum wednesday at about two to thirty p.m pacific time when i get to sit down virtually
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:39.200]   with you and miss miss is taking boughlin and mr. Jarvis and just how much that means to me
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:47.120]   the the conversations we have every week yes i'm working but it is i i freaking love just sitting
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:53.600]   with you folks for those two hours and and it it i think that's something that most people enjoy
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.240]   if they had that type of connection with people they can't necessarily go out and hang out at the
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:04.400]   bar or anything like that but if you can fire decent audio and decent camera and be able to see
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.280]   each other and just have some meaningful conversation that's a that goes a long way in supplementing
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.200]   just the regular in-person experience in my opinion i mean
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:19.520]   john just pointed out we are actually in the met first yeah we're not connected right
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.520]   not the same room we're not in meet space and people who are watching us i think at this point
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:28.560]   probably feel like they're around the table with us uh conversing here's the thing i i really
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:33.680]   don't want to have happen i i think there's a lot of potential in it it'll be very exciting and i
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.520]   think that the things that have been most exciting about technology even things have been created by
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:45.840]   individual creators working in garages working independently i really don't want mark zuckerberg's
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:53.360]   vision of what this is to become the dominant vision that is not ground up that is from top down
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:36:01.360]   i think marks a creep and i don't think his vision of what the metaverse is i mean i find his ideas
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:07.840]   creepy and i don't want him to but is this technologically so hard that it isn't gonna
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.160]   happen kind of naturally is the internet happened it's gonna happen uh you know only from a big
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:20.240]   corporation if you ask you to tell it intel will tell you that uh there's no way we're going to get
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.640]   this in the next five ten years there was a blog post by an intel exec who or i research
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:32.240]   scientist who said look this is going to take a thousand times the compute power we have right
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.720]   now the unfortunately the blog post ended up kind of being an advertisement because at the end
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.040]   they're like but we can do things like uh machine learning and artificial intelligence which intel
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:46.960]   chips can do to get us sort of the way there but the larger argument was that yeah the thing that
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.200]   facebook is trying to say is coming next year the year after is quite a way to agree with you and
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:59.120]   if you look at it it's very cartoony uh but but let's not forget what how what's the order of magnitude
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:07.360]   between uh the uh first IBM PC running at four megahertz and today's iPhone running you know
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:12.800]   we've got billions of transistors in our pockets running at many gigahertz that's more than a thousand
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:20.240]   so i don't think saying oh a thousand times more power is really a deterrent it's you right it's
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.680]   not going to happen today it's not going to happen tomorrow some form of it might
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:29.680]   like what we're experiencing right now right but but but maybe ten years from now maybe 20 years
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.040]   from now we'll certainly have that capability uh the only question is i i really don't want it to
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:40.880]   come from a big i don't want to come top down i think it needs to be organically developed i don't
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:48.080]   want one company to run it that would say it wouldn't be something that the open source community jumps
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:53.440]   on and and oh i'm sure they are well i mean people like jerene leneer he's been working on this for
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:38:00.400]   20 years himself one of the very first proponents of virtual reality uh so i think that there is a
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.520]   movement that way i just don't want it to come from i don't want mark zuckerberg to own the metaverse
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:11.600]   that to me is a nightmare scenario it's worth pointing out that facebook did actually say or
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.760]   meta did actually say we don't want to own yeah out of our sure but exactly then you name your
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:23.600]   company meta so really i don't know if i can use that i'd like to see i would love to i mean look
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:27.200]   what the internet has done and i don't think we would have known 20 or 30 years ago what the
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.440]   internet was going to be today and it's certainly made a huge difference in our lives and everything
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:38.320]   we experience i think that the vr ar mixed reality i think it's all going to be part of something is
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:43.440]   absolutely going to happen it's might take 10 20 years uh but just like 20 years ago you saw
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:48.160]   the beginnings of the internet um i think now we're seeing the beginnings of it i just don't
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:54.720]   i think the internet succeeded because it was a lot of little people it eventually you know became
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:01.600]   dominated by a handful of companies to its i think to its disadvantage to its detriment but
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:08.800]   maybe we can do something a little better this time with ar and vr i'm hoping a thousand
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:14.880]   blockchain enthusiasts just said that's how we solve yeah that's web three i think the next
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.360]   year will be the year of web three we'll be talking a lot about that we talked a lot about nft's this
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:29.680]   year and you even minted some nft's yeah how's that going for you i have a love hate relationship
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:40.000]   within fts i i totally did the idea of creative artists being able to to get money for their works
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:47.440]   another way um but at the same time it is such a ripoff in some instances when it comes to
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:53.760]   many things and gas fees and then there's the whole aspect of people just freaking right click
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:59.360]   and downloading whatever digital asset that you have out there anyway um if it's like an image
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:05.200]   or what have you and you totally lose that on that but i do like that people want to collect things
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:10.640]   like um oh doctor was saying before you like baseball cards people wanted to collect baseball
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.680]   cards and they they invested in that they paid their however many bucks per package of baseball
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:21.600]   card and i like that a creative artist could could earn revenues from that and make a living off of
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:29.040]   it but what i don't like is uh just how difficult and expensive it could be um when you deal on
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:36.160]   with gas fees and stuff like that so you can try different blockchains but boy we are so early in
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:41.440]   this game and then you start talking about wallets to people and they assume you're talking about
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.960]   paypal and no i'm not talking about paypal and talking about an actual crypto wallet well how do i
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:51.120]   create a crypto wallet okay you go to this website or how can how can i get money into that crypto
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:57.920]   wallet well you need to make sure you convert your USD to something like ETH or BTC or do what i'm
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:04.160]   going you know and so i've already lost that sale you know yeah it feels like right now this is
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:10.800]   ripe territory for scammers and speculators but maybe something will come of this down the road i
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:16.000]   think blockchain technology is interesting uh i just think that the people have latched onto it
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:23.600]   or not i know two people that have made some good money which is last year in nft's and i am
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:29.520]   so happy for them and proud of them yeah you know but it was definitely uh lightning in the bottle
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:35.040]   in my opinion yeah can i ask you a question aunt dude you know people who have made a good amount
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.800]   of money on nft's do they already have an audience like because i think i think the general that
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:46.560]   the one of them has a large audience one of them has a very large audience on the other one his
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:53.200]   his audience was not much bigger than mine you know it's super talented still but yeah yeah
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:42:00.560]   yeah it's it's interesting to me like i mean i mean as i you know i have an investigated nft's
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.720]   on whether like it's even worth you know spending my own time with it you know i'm not making image
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:12.800]   art and making music but um but you know they're not too able totally nft's right but i guess anything
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.640]   is really nftable but um but there is a lot of interest in this from the uh from the creator
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:24.080]   space just from the perspective of hey great here's a possible potential way for us to actually be
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.560]   paid what we feel like we all right because they don't want to have to deal with the middle man
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.800]   especially the way you being a musician the music industry was just killing the musician
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:41.040]   so i completely it's not even cool and this is something where they can totally you know uh
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:47.840]   insulate themselves from that type of robbery and and but our gas fees the new middleman
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:54.320]   that's what it's starting to look like to me that's really feels that way and and then there's no real
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:43:01.600]   you can't really predict it um there was one point you know several weeks ago i went to
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:09.280]   so i had some altcoins out there uh not bitcoin just some regular altcoins and they grew quite nice
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:15.280]   and i was like well this is a fun ride i'm going to take my money and run kind of thing but man i
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:23.440]   think i ended up losing 40 45 percent in gas fees oh just can you explain or someone explain what gas
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.920]   fees are if there's anybody out there listening who's going what is gas basically the transaction
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:34.080]   fees on getting money to one wallet in the way from another wallet you know yeah and it ends up
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:40.400]   being ridiculously expensive yeah and it changes on the hour one yeah yeah it's just
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:46.400]   really hard and next minute is low it's it's ridiculous there's no rhyme or reason to it yeah
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:55.760]   ah big rotor one of the things i asked you guys to do uh before we started the show is to come up
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:03.680]   with your stories of the year i'm curious let's start with you Jason how what was it what in
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.760]   your sphere of course i host all about android so i'm gonna guess it has something to do with that
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:14.480]   yeah in your sphere it's shocking what was the big surprise what's the story you think you should
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:20.720]   pay attention to i mean so i guess i guess each and every year following android i could possibly
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.080]   say the the latest version of android but this year i feel like it was especially important um
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:32.880]   in the past however many years the major the new major major version of android had been had felt
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:38.320]   i mean significant i suppose enough for another you know another number increment or whatever but
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.520]   still at the onset looking at it kind of hard to come up with like okay well what's different here
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.640]   oh it's a little bit of this little bit of that and i felt like android 12 at least you know you
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:54.240]   could argue whether you like it or not but at least this time google said hey let's make a big change
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.600]   to the us and really get in there and kind of shake things up a little bit i just kind of felt
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.200]   like google had been kind of getting a little i don't know a little sleepy i don't want to say
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:11.120]   lazy because they've they've definitely done work behind the scenes but the os just kind of needed
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.920]   needed some extra attention and i actually like android 12 i know i know that um
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:21.040]   yeah at least you and you've said that you you aren't a huge fan of android 12 i like the changes
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:28.640]   that they made with material you um i i really like a lot of the the privacy uh focused changes
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:34.160]   seeing the little chip that tells me when my camera my microphone is live uh you know being
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:40.080]   able to have approximate location information instead of very specific here's where you are
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:46.640]   you can tell an app i'm approximately in this large geographic area um you know a number of
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:52.400]   other changes it's it's not it's not ground you know like record shattering by any stretch but
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:57.280]   at least it shows that google is still putting some time in to come up with something different
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:03.200]   and unique and i appreciated that i can't think of another android version that has been so
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:08.640]   controversial on the one hand jelly bean really was jelly bean yeah jelly bean was the one for
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:14.320]   tablets though that was no not jelly bean honeycomb so honeycomb honeycomb honeycomb okay honeycomb
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:19.360]   for sure it was a long time ago but but i have to say this one there are people who say it's the
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:24.000]   you know and the pick going i have to say the to me android 12 and the pixel six kind of go together
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.600]   they know they do because you can't get anywhere else but uh i've seen people say the pixel six
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.160]   and android 12 that's the phone of the year the best phone out there i've also seen people and
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:40.560]   it's not alone by any means say this is this is a nightmare this is the most buggy version of android
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:47.760]   ever it's a real hit or miss proposition i myself have some issues at first i was thinking okay
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.960]   it's the developers with the apps that i like to use you know they haven't quite updated and you
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:58.320]   know i get that that happens but then when i started noticing core functionality of the os just
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:04.000]   puking on me it's not the developers it's google and its development team that did a
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.280]   craptastic job of quality assurance testing yeah yeah there are there are aspects of the o s that
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:17.200]   um when i've encountered them kind of make you feel like okay maybe this was kind of rushed to hit
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:22.560]   a timeline or whatever but um i have no problem with certain react i feel like you could say that
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.040]   about all of all of their releases that's just kind of how google works right it's like let's
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:31.760]   put it out of the way we have it and then you find out after the fact that it's never perfect
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:35.280]   it's literally never perfect coming from google i guess i'm used to it yeah
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:42.000]   jakett was okay right jakett was okay right there's such an ancient history though honeycomb and
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.400]   kick-ass it was so long ago yeah i mean uh i wouldn't i'm of course there've been problems but i
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:54.480]   but i thought android 11 was pretty reliable and red 10s been pretty good um 12 seems like
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:48:00.560]   there's issues and there's some and some protracted and long-term issues and then other people are
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:06.480]   saying oh no man this is the best thing ever so i'm i'm actually very puzzled uh i think you could
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:10.960]   make an argument looking at what we've talked about today with microsoft and and google and
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:16.320]   apple will we'll get to the apple that maybe software is just starting to uh
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:26.960]   fall apart i kept thinking all right maybe it's me maybe it's the phone so i've done the the factory
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:31.360]   reset and wiping of the phone and all of that stuff you might have just gotten a bad phone it's
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:39.920]   it is completely possible what's your what's your story of of the year and well it's it's all about
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:46.880]   ransomware and they hit pretty dad gum close to home first was the colonial pipeline and
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:52.880]   and then getting hit with the ransomware attack back in may i believe it was the
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:58.080]   yeah this was this was the i think this was the one that really put rivol on them on not only on
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:05.120]   the map but also put them in the sites in the uh in the target zone when when that went down and
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:12.000]   to hear the story about you know it's just a lack of security on colonnials yeah um
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.840]   behalf is actually that was dark side i apologize it was a real it just it it's
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:22.960]   stung but at the same time when that happened i had i was on vacation and gone back to visit my
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:29.520]   mother in carolina and all of a sudden we couldn't get any gasoline that was uh that was the
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:34.080]   pipeline went down that was the one where you heard all the stories about people hoarding gasoline
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:43.120]   long lines and i go to get gasoline gas yeah why is the bags really i go to get gasoline one day and
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:50.960]   and this was like my second day second day there on vacation and i'm like why is there a line in
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:58.640]   the middle of nowhere south carolina for this petroleum and sure enough man i picked up my phone
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.720]   and saw the news about the ransomware and they had to shut it they had to shut down
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:08.880]   um the pipeline because of this and it just the whole trickle-down effect so i spent a lot of my
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:13.760]   time i was able to go out and do one shoot but i spent a lot of my time just sort of sitting on
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:20.960]   the couch because didn't have much gasoline um it's just uh it's just stung but then the next
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:28.240]   story is another ransomware attack with Sinclair Broadcasting and that one hit close to home because
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:37.120]   my mom is the same clear employee now granny she's not going to tell me everything that went down but
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:42.560]   she had her concerns like all the employees there and the people that don't know about Sinclair it's
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:49.120]   television broadcast network and when this happened this happened on the weekend they're in football
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:55.040]   game so that's when a lot of these um networks make a lot make most of their money is there in
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:51:01.360]   football season and the ads during football season and things just sort of went to crap that weekend
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:07.040]   and they were down for quite a while i believe i saw a new story that they were down at least
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:12.800]   until november of this shoot the attack happened in october but i believe they were down until
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.400]   november of this year um because of that which make me question wow how are their backups what
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:23.040]   happened you know something what else is going on with this how are they down for a month after
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:32.320]   a ransomware attack yeah of course uh colonial paid the ransom and that's another word on
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:36.880]   Sinclair because i looked that up to see if Sinclair paid i never heard word if they paid i have a
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:42.320]   feeling that's one of the trends we can talk about in 2020-22 is just giving up saying all right take
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:47.680]   your money uh in this case the fbi got some of that money back i don't know if it got back to
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:53.360]   colonial or the fbi kept it but they got some of that money back and it was an infrastructure attack
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:58.400]   and i think those infrastructure attacks are what really got our government to sit up take notice
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:05.280]   and to do something about ransomware so in a way that was a turning point don't insurance companies
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:11.440]   now offer ransomware protection yeah they did i don't know if they still do you know i thought
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:17.760]   about this because if they're offering this protection then then pay company that gets
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:23.200]   hey come the company yeah they just like whatever or it's a customer they have been yeah we talked
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.800]   this was uh at the beginning of the year maybe was the end of last year i think maybe then the end
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:32.800]   of last year uh thanks to the pandemic a lot of schools were kind of uh abandoned and uh
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:37.680]   schools and city governments ended up getting really attacked and it turned out that one of the
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:43.440]   reasons they were so popular is because they often did pay because they had insurance and uh and so
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:49.920]   uh you know ransomware authors authors and and their affiliates are not dumb they're going
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:57.520]   after what's like what's the incentive on being more secure in my enterprise it or small business
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:03.120]   it if i got insurance right and then what's the incentive for the bad guys to say oh they got
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:07.760]   insurance they're gonna pay they're gonna keep coming harder and harder you know that's right yeah
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:15.200]   mica what was your story of the year uh my story of the year so it's kind of a jumping off point
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:22.400]   because in 2020 this was actually when the apple versus epic case kicked off so if you are not
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:29.440]   aware uh the apple versus epic case was this interesting start uh to a conversation where epic
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:36.720]   games which makes fortnite uh released an update to its app in the app store and nothing happened
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:44.080]   at that point but then it uh made an update on the server side that pushed an update to the game
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:51.520]   essentially that let people sort of circumvent the app stores apples app store uh in app purchase
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:57.440]   system to be able to get credits for the game that they were playing and then they publicized it on
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:04.960]   purpose um apple shut them down and then epic games put out this whole press release in this video
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:09.840]   where they uh did a parody of an original video from apple original advertisement from apple
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:17.200]   and then things went from there essentially epic game said hey look um we think that the app store
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:22.320]   is a monopoly and that uh we should be able to have our own payment system within the app store
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:30.080]   without having to pay apples commission etc etc and then that turned into for me especially
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:38.720]   i've never paid so much attention to um antitrust and and sort of fairness rules so to speak uh when
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:46.960]   it comes to tech companies i had not personally considered the app store and apple's commission
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:52.800]   as much as i did this past year i had not considered uh google's take on this and their commission i
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:57.360]   had not considered and paid attention to all of the companies who were making changes chris capisella
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:03.120]   was just on windows weekly uh for the end of the year episode and he was talking about something
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.320]   that he considered to be one of microsoft's hidden gems which was clearly a kind of point at the other
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:14.800]   companies talking about app store fairness where in the uh microsoft store the windows store um
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:20.640]   the commissions are you know different and that they anybody can have a store and they don't charge
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:26.640]   very much yeah exactly and so there's just a lot of attention being paid to that this year
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:34.960]   that i think it hasn't seeped as much into the uh general what milieu as um the supply chain has
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:41.840]   it's not as much of a meme or a hashtag but app store fairness and that kind of conversation about
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:50.640]   what developers deserve and sort of the examination of epics handling and now this ongoing um the
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:55.440]   court cases is continuing to be sort of pushed back and pushed back and pushed back and pushed back
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:02.560]   all of that regulation of the government kind of paying attention now to these app stores and apple
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.280]   and google's place in that i think it's been a really fascinating thing to watch this year and
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:13.120]   i think it's going to continue on for several years yeah in a way even though epic did lose this
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:18.800]   case in every respect even down to the judges uh requirement that apple opened its app store being
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:25.840]   overturned by the ninth district uh just last week uh epic got nothing tactically from the suit
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:30.640]   but you're right from from a point of view of mind share they kind of did win a victory and apple
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:36.080]   even has had a kind of cave and give in a little bit and give you a think some stuff right yeah there's
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:40.560]   been a few changes that have come by that apple you know of course says oh you know this is what
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:49.680]   we were gonna do but it's very clear that it's in response to uh the EU and in response to sort of
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:54.160]   these yeah it's getting ahead of those things these preemptive decisions that are very clearly so
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:01.360]   yeah they they didn't win the the war but they certainly uh got into the history books as a were
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:04.800]   very good point i actually hadn't thought about that but we would we wouldn't be having these
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:13.520]   conversations except for epic's lawsuit three good stories when we come back the silliest stories of
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:20.000]   2021 and this was hard to pick believe it or not there were quite a few uh we'll get to that in just
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.880]   a bit as we wrap up our holiday specials so nice i'm so glad you guys could get together it's funny
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:28.720]   i completely forgotten we're not we were hoping we could all be in the same room because of omochron
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:34.560]   we can't we're not uh but it does this is virtual reality isn't it it feels like we're sitting around
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:39.520]   the table and and having a nice conversation it's kind of kind of interesting you've got our
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:45.760]   holograms uh around the table yeah it's as if we're truly there you're practically here with you
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.640]   now go get some booze and we'll come back and get silly in just a little bit i showed
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:58.640]   today brought to you by userway.org accessibility is so important uh it i mean it's the law in the
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:03.440]   united states the americans with disabilities act requires that any public entity be accessible
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:08.800]   and that includes every single website but it's also important because there are a large number of
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:14.160]   people who can't use your website who can't shop in your store who can't use your shopping cart
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:20.000]   and i think you want them to be able to it's it's a right thing to do it's good for business
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:25.520]   it's also the law now the problem is and i'm very sympathetic running a quite a few websites
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:29.920]   myself you look at that and go now what do i have to do to have to our developers
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:34.880]   how which time is it's going to take how much is it going to cost let me introduce you to userway

[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:22.560]   really really good thanks to ai it'll fix complex nav menus which is often a very big problem for
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:27.920]   blind users their screen readers just they just get lost on those hamburger menus userway ensures

[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:46.720]   the way and there's an accessibility layer on all browsers so people come to your browser
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:52.320]   and just use the front page if they can see they just use the front page but if somebody comes there
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:58.960]   and they have disability software screen readers or such running it'll use the accessibility layer
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:04.160]   and it does two things first of all it shows them shows the software the stuff they need so that
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:09.360]   they can generate a speech or whatever it is to make that site accessible but they also make
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:15.520]   it customizable and that's important too because everybody's different there's no one disabled
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.680]   person there there's all kinds of disabilities so it's important that you also be flexible in

[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:58.720]   this weekend taken for all of our blind listeners and disabled listeners who really appreciate
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:11.760]   making that stuff accessible. So last we talked about scientists taking a tardigrade which is
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:18.400]   every kindergartners favorite animal it's a microscopic animal lives in moss they sometimes
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:22.640]   they call them a water bear because it looks like a bear it's got little claws it's really the cutest
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:28.160]   thing but they're also tough they've been put in space for two weeks and survived they've been
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:34.560]   frozen they've been shot out of a gun and survived so this gave me the inspiration for this whole
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:42.160]   segment because scientists have taken it's singapore have taken a tardigrade this little
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:49.120]   microscopic water bear and it's the first multicellular organism to be put inside a quantum entanglement
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:04:00.960]   they don't even know what it means they put it on a qubit from a quantum computer it was in a
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:06.560]   quantum entanglement and so that made me think you know i bet there's some other stories from the
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:12.080]   here that uh is that five nanometers or what oh it's tiny let me see
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:20.000]   oh i get it what's the process oh my god he's making geek jokes now oh no
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:27.600]   i tried to pull a kevin i'm sorry these are so cute look at the tardigrades they're so cute
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:33.760]   little water bears creepy i mean there's just are they creepy about those those claw hands yeah
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:39.120]   the like pucker face is is kind of unsettling to me it is a little it looks a little bit like
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:44.560]   a sci-fi alien it really does and maybe they are aliens i mean they kind of floated through space
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:50.000]   to get here these things 20 times the size of us are going to be the things that land on earth and
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.480]   and we reach our end well i didn't know this but uh tim stevens yesterday i'm sorry last twit last
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:05.520]   sunday uh said that they that tardigrades power the discover discovery and star star star star
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:09.680]   star yeah that's a spoiler but i was gonna mention it and i was like no that's a spoiler
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.520]   yeah if you don't know that already which i don't that's true
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:23.920]   now you know actually every single tardigrade in existence was created the moment that they put
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:30.240]   it in a quantum entanglement all the beginning of history to all of them were actually creating
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:36.960]   time at that moment yeah yeah they all existed from that point past and forward you want to see a
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:44.800]   video of a tardigrade mating not particularly you know i'm not really sorry never mind never
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:49.520]   mind are you sure it wasn't a defecating i don't know what it was doing it says it was mating that's
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:57.280]   just this was the year they and this i think began the supply chain crisis the ever-given
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:06.960]   container ship got stuck in the suiz canal that was hilariously it was hysterical you know what
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:13.360]   that did when when that was all going down that really took me back to like the old days of twitter
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:18.640]   when some random event would happen that everybody was watching like patiently every day like checking
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:25.040]   in on the status like i got i got those fields around the ever-given container there were a lot
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:35.600]   of memes about ever-given still are yeah there's so i i took 106 days to get it out of the canal
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:40.320]   they they were able to open it up to traffic in a few but that took 106 days to get it out
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:45.760]   and it's a big container ship it had a lot of containers on that sucker
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:53.600]   yeah so the ever-given everything to the the the person in charge whatever happened
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:59.120]   oh where are they now sort of situation where are they there's any fallout about
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:02.560]   still stuck in the suiz canal didn't let them leave
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:09.360]   i remember it because uh that was right around when i started playing valheim which is for me the
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:15.760]   story of the year uh you were running around you around here you were playing a stupid video game
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:22.240]   but my character is named ever-given oh that's amazing because i guess because i was stuck in valheim
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:27.840]   i don't know uh april fools we'll do this chronologically so that was march april fools
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:33.520]   vw puts out a press release a few days early saying they're going to rename the company vaults
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:39.520]   wagon because they're going to go all electric and then when journalists call to say is this an
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:45.600]   april fools joke they say no except it was it was
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:50.640]   they're stock right they had a stock increase because of the choice decision and so then that
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:55.600]   called in what the ftc going now we have to investigate this april fools prank because you
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:03.200]   may have tampered with the uh marketplace yeah and they also lost a bunch of journalists uh trust
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:07.360]   and respect in the process so yeah you know not a good idea all the way you do an april fools joke
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:11.760]   but don't lie to the press when they ask you is this an april fools joke just say yes it is aren't
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:19.920]   we clever um say no comment that's fine we had a lot of fun playing this oh it's been
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:25.760]   disabled i can't play it the italian video probably i didn't yeah the italian sports caster
[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:32.080]   who couldn't during the olympics couldn't log into the laptop in the booth so on mic
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:38.560]   on apparently unwittingly on mic he asks somebody in the booth what's the password for this thing
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:43.520]   and the guy shouts the password which is terrible yeah i remember it's the booth number and then he
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:50.880]   says but that's a terrible password but security through obscurity it was all an italian so
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:57.840]   i'm scared of us anyway i will translate it was during the broadcast of the turkey chili
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:03.760]   volleyball game turkey chili that sounds like something good i do like turkey chili the turkey
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:10.000]   the turkey china volleyball game there goes our turkish and chilien fan but he says
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.440]   and we had i think carolina millinese was on the show during this so she was translating
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:19.760]   do you know the password for the computer in this a commentator booth he asked
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:27.520]   and when he was told that it's based on this booth number he said um he said
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:35.360]   italian profanity it was too hard to call the password people people bluetoppolino
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:45.440]   turns out the password was booth dot zero three which was in fact the name of the booth
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:51.920]   lord of mercy mopork kamizeria he concluded using the popular italian swear word that
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:10:00.960]   literally means a pig's misery uh anyway i don't think any security breaches is a result but if
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:08.240]   you're ever in booth zero three you know the password go right ahead can i'm in my story of the year yes
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:16.080]   with miss uh millinese speaking italian twit oh my gosh is that is that great oh she's
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:22.320]   made my liver quiver and you didn't want to see tardigrades mating
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:26.560]   i'm out of here astros
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:33.920]   did remember now did they release this amazon's astro robot the one with the extending neck oh my
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:41.040]   god this was i this was ridiculous did anybody buy this thing somebody ordered i thought you did
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:46.320]   no i never put i put my name down for some of the other things but i never put my name down for that
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:50.880]   one because i just think it's a foolish product and also uh yeah there were several people who had
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:55.840]   reportedly worked on it who were like yet no one needs to put this in their house it will literally
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:02.400]   drive off of stairwells and try to throw this up down the stairs yeah it'll throw itself down the
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:11.280]   stairs still available by request oh you can ask what you can request and uh it has to be granted
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:20.400]   the idea is that it will patrol your home and uh spy on your kids and uh and if i think later
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:25.920]   on this video it discovers a problem in the kitchen oh no that's how it charges it goes in
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:33.360]   it charges and it sleeps look at the little eyes go to sleep oh that's so cute but if you hear a noise
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:39.040]   in the kitchen no no no no no it's now it's now it's just macking on the teenage star name there
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:44.080]   it is here's going it's running off to the kitchen run the my favorite part is when it when it raises
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:51.840]   its periscope to look around oh that's so creepy here's it i can turn on the sound yes can i
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:55.200]   it's going in here's oh there's a mess in the kitchen
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:03.200]   it's raising the periscope showing you a picture of and then he presses the alarm button
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:12.000]   and the raccoon scampers away wow grabbing whatever he has a cupcake yeah yeah it's
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.120]   yeah it's a good reason now by the way does the robot clean up no because it can't no it can't do
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:21.920]   anything except bring you a beer if you put a beer in the cup holder on the robot
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:28.720]   let's wrap around with it so robots have a lot of rosy this is not rosy no it's definitely not
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:36.000]   this is this is nobody's idea of a good idea hey man wow that's also the title of this episode
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.800]   yes exactly no i already know the title okay smitten by 2021
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:54.720]   finally the story of the guy who accidentally swallowed his air pods
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:03.520]   turns out he was sleeping in them rolled over oh no and groggily he says
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:10.080]   i moved my phone off the pillow and removed the wireless air pod head from from one ear
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:15.760]   the other had fallen out and i couldn't find it still barely awake i patted to the bathroom for
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:26.400]   a sip of water but couldn't swallow properly a clue my throat my throat filled with water
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:32.400]   a clue but wouldn't go down i had to lean over the sink let the water train out
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:38.720]   goodness that's scary it was bizarre and alarming but i was so tired what did he do he went back to bed
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:44.160]   oh that's almost dudes i can't swallow this something to my throat but i'm going to go back
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:49.280]   to bed that's so frustrating to me the wife says all the doctor honey he says no no i'm fine
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:54.400]   i checked together the missing earbud in the morning i used to find my air pond function on my
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:58.800]   phone which makes them in headphones beep but the batteries are flat so they didn't beep
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:09.680]   still couldn't swallow a clue uh anyway eventually eventually after another mouthful of water comes
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:16.320]   straight up he begins to wonder it took him like all day i'd also become aware of a faint pressure
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:22.560]   in the middle of my chest uh he he goes to the doctor and they give him an x-ray and
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:28.080]   the doctor's expression when she returned was priceless i bet this dude doesn't eat breakfast
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:35.920]   i mean obviously not well i'll be damned she said she led me to her workstation surrounded by my
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:41.840]   medical staff on the screen a cartoon clear image of my ribs parked between them at 45 degrees
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:52.480]   the missing air pod um you solved the mystery okay even more terrifying they went to the
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:59.760]   endoscopy center the air pod was retrieved using a tube with a lasso attachment and he says it still
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:08.880]   works fine hopefully doesn't wear them to bed anymore the next apple ad yes talk about durability
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:14.000]   saves your life and actually there is also a post from a woman who swallowed her air pods apparently
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:21.840]   it's happening a lot and accidentally she says recorded audio from her stomach when i saw this
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:28.480]   i'm thinking to myself i must be a super taster because there's no way something has been in my
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:36.240]   ears you just thought stupid you just thought stupid she said i i had a ibuprofen tablet in one

[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:41.840]   college football that's correct all the ball games you got a a week of ball games ahead
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:46.400]   that is correct is there really a jimmy kimmel bowl or is that yes it is and it was a great
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:52.000]   game sir how does how does jimmy kimmel have a bowl named after him i don't understand it's it's
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:58.080]   actually a pretty good story because he is a college sports fan and you know la doesn't necessarily
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:03.360]   do college like that even though there's uc la and usc there they just don't do college football the
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:07.600]   way the rest of the country does and he wanted to bring a bit of a presence so he was able to get
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:13.840]   some spotsters to put some stuff together and they came up with the los angeles jimmy kimmel bowl
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:18.880]   and it ended up being really good it was Oregon state versus utah state Oregon states from the
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:24.400]   paktoil Utah states from the mountain voice i believe in it was it was an entertaining game i
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:30.720]   thought the bees are growing to win but they don't host good football the jimmy kimmel bowl that's
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.400]   hysterical well have a what he's a football fan yeah no i guess it makes sense i mean it's
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:42.080]   every fans dream to have a bowl game named after them he even had um his own little sandwich served
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:48.000]   there a special sandwich served there with the taligan beef and stuff uh that the winner they
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:55.360]   didn't get a trophy they got a big golden wrestling belt instead that's stuff like kimmel he had a
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:04.240]   lot of fun with it it was great it was great have a great holiday ant and uh thank you sir

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:30.720]   no it's uh the lords of the manner would box up all the food from the christmas feast that they
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:39.760]   didn't eat and distribute it to the peasants daily village and serfs yeah so it's not a day we we like
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:47.840]   to think about us yeah white folk i prefer to think of festivists nothing to celebrate
