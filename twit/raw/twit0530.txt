[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.120]   Jarvis who is our regular on this week in Google the author. I was going to correct
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.760]   you say no. You're on the big show. I bet you grown up stable. Which is silly because I
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   think there is no grown up show more grown up show than this week in Google that we do
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   on the network but I'm glad you're here it's always fun to have you here we at the grown
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.240]   up's table we get to drink. Mmm that is the difference. Nice to have you. Oh surely temples
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.400]   for me. Jeff is a professor of journalism at CUNY he is the author of a couple of several
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   very good books including what would Google do public parts his latest geek sparing gifts
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.240]   about the reinventing the news industry we'll talk about that a little bit you want to reinvent
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   the ad business as well. Blogger at Buzz Machine.com also joining us from ours Technica their senior
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.720]   products editor Andrew A Cunningham great to have you Andrew. Hey thanks for having me.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.120]   He's got blisters on his fingers having completed the first post John Syracuse a review of an
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.040]   OS 10 update. Yeah someone's got to do it. I actually took two of you to do it right.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.080]   Yeah we had two of us and then one other person contributed some stuff on network.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.480]   Yeah he is a hard person to replace. Wow wow when you must have had chills get on your
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.080]   spy on Syracuse and said I don't think I'm going to do this anymore. And I was worrying
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.800]   about it for years and then finally came to happen. Well we'll talk about it OS 10 and
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.280]   can be 10. And Andrew has lots more to talk about you can see him at ours Technica.com
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.080]   and on Twitter at Andrew writes. Also want to welcome another great writer and a long
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.560]   time member of the Twit family Jason Heiner from CBS Interactive and I owe him a big thank
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.080]   you. People been asking me all year. How come they never read about you and follow the geeks.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.520]   Yeah Jason. We've never seen it to us too. Yeah Jason Heiner and Lindsey Gilpin have
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.240]   written a really good book. You're almost done now. If you've been following along at home
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.800]   you could read each chapter for a month online. Or is it a month or a couple of weeks online.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.960]   It is. It's basically a month. We've been releasing one a month. One chapter month.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.440]   As we finish them we've been releasing them online and then the full book is released
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.620]   at the end of the year. How exciting. You got one more chapter. One more mystery. One
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.800]   more mystery and this one. I see lots of nominees. Everybody say well you forgot so
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.080]   and so we got so and so. I'm just so honored. Right. So honored to be included because it
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.400]   really is. It's a great book with many of my great friends are in it and as I told you
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.600]   this is probably the only chance I'm going to get to get a biography. So I am grateful
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.560]   and as bad as complete a biography as you can get you wrote a lot and interviewed my
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.520]   mom and Kate with yellow and my wife. Yeah it's my mom amazing. Yeah what a character.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.680]   Love your mom. Yeah. Some great stories. Great stories. So thank you for doing that and
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.040]   people can read it right now. Follow the geeks book dot com. Yes sir. Beritunde Veronica
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:24.520]   Belmont. Yeah. You've had some. Genes Rapani. So many Genes Rapani. So many great people
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.320]   in this Lisa Bettany. Yeah Tom Merritt. Om Malik Chase Jarvis the photographer. Julianna
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.680]   Rotich the founder of Usha Heedee and now me and one more chapter to go. Who's left? Yeah
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.920]   who's mystery guest number 10. I've got a lot of people guessing especially today you
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.960]   know after the talk of you know your chapter. I think everybody everybody kind of guessed
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:00.560]   that you were likely in there right. I think and certainly requested. But the last one
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.240]   I doubt anyone will guess the last get the last one is one of someone that everybody
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.320]   will I think be blown away by and no one will guess. So that's that's pretty big. Everyone
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.040]   know who this person is. No one knows who it is. No no no I don't mean that I mean when
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.960]   they see the name they'll say oh I know what that is. No most people won't but after they
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.520]   read it. Oh it's your. Kind of well obscure in the circles that most of the people who
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:39.520]   here are in. But once they read but very widely known in some other circles but dovetails perfectly
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.480]   with kind of where we're going in terms of the future because it's a lot of.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:52.880]   Enigmatic clue. I've never done this to you Jason but I know what can I say it's Jeff
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.080]   gets to one clue enigmatic. That's good with us. That's redundant I guess but yes one
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.840]   clue. Yeah. Raise it in the form of a riddle please. Patterson in our chat room says it's
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.080]   Arlene Dahl from What's My Line. Only Jeff Jarvis and I would even get that joke. That's
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:25.880]   awesome. This person has been has has rubbed shoulders with some very famous talk show hosts
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.360]   this year. I don't know how good of a clue that is. No more. We don't want to spoil
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.640]   it. The laws was just on Jimmy Fallon with a great episode. Who was. Oz. How about Elon
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.120]   Musk. Did you do how many of you watch the Tesla announcement this week? Tesla X because
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.880]   it has doors that go like this. I don't really see a riddle as commentary about it.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.120]   Elon seems to have really fall. It is stride as a presenter. You know I agree the thing
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.080]   that was amazing to me was when he did that battery unveiling and like how interesting can
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:10.600]   you make a battery right. Let's be honest. But he kept it to 20 like 20 to 25 minutes
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.280]   if I remember correctly. And at the end I was like oh my god like this was amazing.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.000]   How did he make how did he make a battery interesting and I thought this is this is pretty significant
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.480]   actually because in the past I've seen a lot of the times he's spoken and hasn't always
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.440]   been you know riveting. But that battery he made it about the fact that you know look
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.840]   we've been saving the world. It was about saving the world exactly. Somehow he convinced
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.040]   I think pretty convincingly made us believe that buying this battery would help save the
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.480]   world at least in some small way. He's kind of convinced me I have to say I've resisted
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:52.800]   buying the Tesla. But after the event I finally put it in a reservation. Just a reservation
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.960]   for the new model for the model X. Because it has doors that go like I mean it's got the
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.000]   yeah the back of the future doors. You know one of the reasons actually Jason
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.640]   Callicannis who was on the new screensavers yesterday as was an early Tesla adopter has
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.280]   all of them. In fact I think was the first guy on the reservation list for the model
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:21.000]   S. He he told me there's a supercharger in Petaluma. So these are the free refill free
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.840]   refill electrical refill stations that charge really fast like a hundred miles range in
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.280]   half an hour. Well you know I was thinking about this. Well he promised that in 2017
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.960]   I think it is he'll get up to 600 miles 620 yeah. So to me this is that that's it. That's
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.200]   it. As long as as far as you can drive in a day without complete butt rock. Yeah. That's
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.160]   it. That's the right to the butt rock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Five hundred six hundred miles
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.760]   that all the objections I have to order gone. Jason. Let me let me just ask you this. Your
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:01.400]   your Mundo killer wonderful amazing super duper Audi isn't diesel is it? No. Okay. I
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   would feel so guilty and I feel so bad for the people who bought diesel Volkswagen's
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:13.880]   and Audi a fours after in the in the aftermath of the revelation that these cars had software
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.960]   that would trick the testers to appear to be ecologically suitable. But then as soon as
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:26.240]   they got off the dynamometer 40 times the nitrogen. Ooh. It's making me cough just to
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.400]   think about it. There were massive polluters and I would feel so I feel so bad for people
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.960]   who drove that car thinking they were driving an eco friendly car. In fact, one of the worst
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.680]   cars on the road that's tear terrifying terrible. So yeah. But this you know an electrical you
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.400]   know as we know electric vehicles aren't necessarily non polluting. The electricity has
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.120]   to be generated somewhere. I thought this was interesting the car filter. That has a bio
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   weapon mode. So this is the largest car filter air filter in any car. And remember you don't
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:09.520]   need an air filter because there's no gas engine. So the air filter is just for the passengers
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   and he showed it off as you can see he's showing it off here. In fact, showed the buttons and
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:21.040]   he's and can you can you hear the audio on this? I don't know if you. What I like about
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.200]   Elon is he's he's off script. There's no script. He's just doing it. He's talking from his
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:33.920]   heart. The brain and his brain. But the quality of the filter is greater. So that translates
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:41.160]   to several hundred fold improvements in the filtration capability. It is. I don't know
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.160]   why they're focusing on this. But yeah, because this is what he cares about.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.400]   I heard that that will have a software update coming soon, which is a zombie evasion. There
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   is a button. Let me see if I can find the part where the bio weapon defense mode. Listen.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:04.800]   He's not. He's not. He's not. He's just pressed the bio weapon defense mode button.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.760]   This is a real button.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.600]   And the geeks go crazy. Wow. Yeah.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:25.800]   This isn't a joke. This is serious. So what? Yeah, we're trying to be a leader in a defense
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.280]   scenario. I swear to God, it's the zombie attack. Anyway, yeah, I did order this not
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.160]   because of the bio weapon defense, but just I feel like I feel a little guilty driving.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.120]   So what were your options? Just battery size. I haven't I haven't gotten them yet. So you'd
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.560]   make the reservation and then you will get an email when it's your turn in line to customize
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.320]   it to order to order it. So I don't know, you know, I'll fall into a real drive, right?
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:59.480]   This model. I don't I don't know anything about it. I just ordered it. So you just swirl
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.840]   all my squirrels. Well, my Audi lease runs out in October and of next year. So this is
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.040]   that's about when this would be available. It just seemed like the right thing to do.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.240]   I don't know. I like I love the idea that I could charge it for free. Well, yeah, look
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:18.160]   at that. The doors and this I'll never have one of them fancy cars with the stores, but
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.520]   this was the doors like that. That's awesome. Somebody pointed out actually that it interestingly
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.000]   enough, they focused on some interesting things. For instance, these doors that you could just
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.720]   get in. He said that eventually they will have it that you can drive into the charger
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.920]   and the charger will come out and automatically attach. You don't have to get out of the car.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.880]   Well, especially if you're in bio defense mode, you don't want to get in the new seats,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.080]   he really emphasized how much room there was under the seats to stove stuff, even though
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.880]   the thing is an SUV has plenty of room in the back. Somebody said, these are all evidence
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   that he intends for this to be the first autonomous taxi cab. It was an interesting piece. Yeah,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.680]   because because you could you could approach the car. It'll open for you. You could put
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.520]   things in. You still it's not really your car. You still things. Yeah. The car, the door opens
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.120]   when the driver approaches. It senses your presence and opens up.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:13.360]   Is it like geo fencing? It's doing some kind of geo-fencing off of like your fob or your
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.720]   phone or something. Presumably more securely than the current one touch fobs work. But
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.760]   I think and and and Eli himself said this is as close to autonomous as you could get
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.560]   today. Does so many things automatically and it's just there it goes, driving off all by
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:35.720]   itself. It's just this close and I feel like this could it be we're getting closer and
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.400]   closer to autonomous vehicles. Matt Hohn and Buzzfeed wrote a very interesting article
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.920]   in which he said these there are in inevitability and how many thousands of tens of thousands
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.520]   of people die in the US every year from auto accidents that would be eliminated if we had
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.680]   autonomous vehicles are presumably be eliminated. So I figure I'll get this car and eventually
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:02.640]   I won't have to drive anymore. It'll just drive me. Actually what the article presupposed
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.680]   was that people would still own the car but then when they're not using it they would
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.360]   let others rent it. That's right. Well or but it's obvious you could also start a company
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:16.960]   that does this. So this is the ultimate attack on labor of course so it's uber without drivers.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.980]   Yeah which a Uber would love I'm sure. Oh yeah. It's interesting. Uber buys a lot of
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:28.400]   ads almost all of them are not ads for riders. They're rights for drivers. Really. I was talking
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:34.320]   to a radio executive in Los Angeles this week and he said yeah we sell a ton of ads to Uber.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.000]   They're just for drivers. They're all for drivers. They need more. They need drivers
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.280]   much more than they need riders apparently. It's like listening to serious and something
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:52.560]   but truck driver ads. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a good business to get into. I there's so much
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.400]   to talk about. I guess we could. Andrew did you go to the Google event or did you did
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.200]   Ron Amadio go who went to Ron? Ron Amadio was there. I was helping like remotely with his
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.880]   coverage of it but he though he was the one who was actually on the ground. Now I watched
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:11.120]   the live stream and everything and just talking about what a yeah we were just talking about
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.880]   what a good presenter Elon Musk is and I've got to say I kind of wish somebody at Google
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.600]   was as good on stage as he is. Yeah. I have to say. Senator Pichai the CEO of Google and
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.040]   now by the way as of Friday this is all official. Alphabet's Reels he's the official CEO of Google.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:36.800]   He got on stage and was there for a minute and then every this presentation after presentation
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.720]   what the impression I got is Google is a large diverse company full of smart people.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.760]   I'm sure that was the intent unlike an Apple event where Tim Cook really runs the game
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.000]   or Steve Jobs ran the show. Sundar got out of the way and they just handed it off and
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.280]   I thought that was you're right I mean it wasn't these aren't showbiz folks. I think
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.120]   they were competent. Were you bored? Yeah I was just all a little little stilted and
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.600]   they were making these jokes that were supposed to sound like they were off the cuff but they
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.240]   had obviously been made like I was six times before. Nothing against any of the products
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.360]   that were that were introduced such as there weren't any there were any show people among
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:18.960]   the presenters on stage I don't think. No. They announced two new phones the 5X the X is
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:26.000]   for Nexus the 5P the P is for premium premium. I believe that's right. That's what they said
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.080]   5.2 inches for the Nexus 5X 5.7 inches for the Nexus 5P. It looked beautiful. Loom solid
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:40.720]   body aluminum phone both have very good quality cameras with the largest to my knowledge the
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:48.680]   largest pixel size on any sensor camera phone sensor 1.55 microns is sounds small and I
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:54.120]   guess technically it is small but it's big for a camera phone. I think these are going
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.960]   to be pretty killer devices. I can't wait I can't wait for London run and it's not and
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.160]   the price is unlike the Nexus 6 the price is very aggressive yes. Yeah not quite down
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.480]   to where the Nexus 4 and the original Nexus 5 were a couple years ago which is too bad
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.320]   but yeah much better than it was last year especially for the 5X which is the one that
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.880]   I think I'm the most interested in. I think the 5 the Nexus 5 is the best Nexus phone
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.280]   that they've ever done. Yeah a lot of people would agree with you on that and the 5X doesn't
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:30.680]   seem much compromised. I mean it's it's you know a pretty high spec device just a smaller
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:37.600]   screen a plastic body not a aluminum body it's an 808 instead of an 810 snap dragon.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.720]   A little bit smaller. Which might be might be a good thing depending on it might be
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.880]   depending on your perspective. It might be battery life might be bad. I mean I've never
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.640]   seen anybody say hey my phone is so slow. That is not that is not really the you know
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.600]   issue. Battery life is the issue. So maybe a little slower processor a little lower res
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.560]   screen you might get better battery life on this thing. I'm glad they're doing the type
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:05.440]   C connector. I'm a believer and they're giving away a 50 which isn't very aggressive a $50
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.320]   credit to the play store when you buy it. Which Lord knows I'll use. Well I would guess
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.600]   trying to woo away Apple. You know iPhone users right say well you'll be able to get
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.560]   enough money because that's one of the sticking points is you've invested in apps. You don't
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.600]   want to have to buy all new apps. Well here's 50 bucks so you don't have to. And three months
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.000]   in Google play music which of course Apple's doing with Apple music. They've also announced
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.560]   an Apple like Nexus protect program that gives you an extra year of warranty even from
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:43.320]   accidental damage. Although there's a 75 deductible and you can use it twice in the two years span.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.800]   Yeah the way they market these in advertisers is always kind of interesting because they're
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.040]   straddling this line where they're they started life kind of as developer phones and that's
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.960]   still but those are still that's still one of the audiences they appeal the most to because
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.180]   they get the fast updates and there's no bloatware or anything. But then you have things like
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:05.240]   Nexus protect and the Google play credit and the Google play music stuff that are obviously
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.760]   like contemporary more for consumers. Yeah so I'm never never quite sure who the intended
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.720]   audience for these things. I also think that they have to answer the genius bar is that
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.280]   you could have some place you can take your phone and wine and they'll do something and
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.680]   Google has to be able to match that. Right especially I think with the Huawei phone because
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:31.160]   I don't think they have an entrenched US support system. Yeah really good point. Yeah. But the
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:39.160]   64 gig five or six P I should say at 550 bucks is a couple hundred bucks less than a compilary
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:44.560]   with quick iPhone. I mean it's an aggressive price. It's spec wise seems similar. I mean
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   you know it's got a fingerprint reader it's on the back it's on the front. Better screen.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.760]   Yeah better. Well we'll see of course all this you know is on paper you got to see it
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:59.360]   first but an AMOLED display 5.7 inches smaller phone because they don't have the large bezels
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.160]   of the iPhone. I think that's impressive but I don't think it's the most exciting announcement
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.880]   they made. And I think the jury's out on whether it's the Chromecast audio which I'm really
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:18.960]   excited about for reasons probably only I understand or the Pixel C tablet. I think
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.160]   that's that we talked about that on this week in Google and the more I've thought about
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.240]   it since our conversation the more excited I am about that. So I haul around my Chromebook
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.400]   pixel with me. I have an old one I can leave one of my office keep one here and then if
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.640]   I travel with that I no longer have to carry the Nexus 7 and I just carry that as a as
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.960]   an on the road laptop. That's pretty exciting. They still don't have the Pixel C on the.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.560]   No I signed up for an or email alert they have yeah if you and if you go to I think it's
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.640]   it's a pixel there's a group goes on come slash war L yeah which is just the C. Yeah
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   I was even mentioned the the Chromebook and it's only one page with with really no information
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.760]   but the thing that was impressive on this was the keyboard and the way the keyboard attached
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:12.360]   I thought was great magnet flips over. Can I pitch in on this just real quick Jason
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.680]   Hell is host all about hand right he has a little bit to say about this. Well just yeah
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:23.200]   the thing that that worries me about the C is that Android as a platform isn't an amazing
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.320]   platform for multitasking slash just getting a lot of things done in the same way that
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:35.760]   Chrome OS actually does succeed in or Windows you know environment succeeds in that's probably
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.600]   why the surface tablet is so popular because they've they've built it with that in mind
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.280]   I don't get that feeling with Android and I worry about this like I'm I'm interested
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.480]   in it as a product because I'm always interested when Google does something different like
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.760]   this based on what they've done in the past and I want to play around with it I've tried
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.240]   to use Android devices that have a keyboard attachment and live my life in that to see
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:06.080]   how it goes and I find it to be way more inconvenient than an OS that is built for that environment
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.760]   in mind so I fear I don't know that this is going to solve many problems in that regard
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:17.480]   I just think it's going to be another option. Right yeah because in one of the really early
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:23.800]   Android M betas there was like an experimental like highly highly experimental multi window
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.440]   right they got that got removed in later betas I think so I'm wondering if we're going to
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:34.080]   see like an Android 6.1 or like 7.0 down the line or something that will reintroduce that
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.760]   feature kind of like Samsung has got it kind of like iOS just introduced in iOS 9 if we're
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.680]   going to see with this particular device if we're going to see some of those new built
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.240]   in features that are kind of alleviate that and make multitasking a little bit easier.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.680]   I think you're right remember when Android came out it was not for tablets and was clued
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:58.960]   on a tablet and Google didn't endorse that and didn't work very well so maybe this my
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.600]   fear is I mean I grew to Jason and there are some who think this is the death of Chrome OS
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.760]   but at the same time Chrome OS brags that will have more devices in schools than all other
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.400]   devices combined and I think for corporate use I think Chrome OS is going to stick around
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.920]   you think so I hope so.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.520]   Oh I don't think it's going anywhere.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.800]   No I don't think it's going anywhere and if it did that would be a big big oversight
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:29.600]   because I primarily for that right like Chrome OS is amazing in the educational space right
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.840]   it's super super convenient way you know way easier for students to just remember their
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.680]   login credentials on whatever machine they happen to be on and have it all thrown on
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.800]   the system and everything and I think it'll push into enterprise too.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.040]   I think salespeople and stuff I think there's a few improvements to make your Chrome that
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.080]   will make it work as an office machine.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.840]   So who's buying tablets then if I mean.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.800]   I mean what we're seeing is at least in business you know because on tech or public that's
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.160]   what we do a lot of right and we talk to a lot of companies and talk about what they're
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.880]   using and CIOs and that kind of thing and you know a lot of what they're using tablets
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:09.480]   for you know when they go to iPads are typically like one apps you know like there's one app
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.360]   that they're trying to access or maybe two or three but they only ever do one at a time
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.920]   similar to like what Jason is saying with with Android because you know their their purpose
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.120]   bill it's a purpose build up rating system for doing one thing at a time and that's its
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.880]   strength and its weakness and its weakness but where we're seeing where we're seeing
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.320]   the you know windows and some traction where we're seeing windows have traction especially
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.800]   surface is when they when people want to do multiple things and they need to run multiple
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.880]   apps and they need to you know work back and forth between things and they have things
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:49.440]   that you know they have to integrate those in those cases that's where surface is making
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.760]   a lot of traction and there's no doubt that that's why Apple you know knowing this as
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.840]   well put out the iPad Pro and is focusing so much on this sort of side by side kind of
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.160]   thing and all that and so we have just seen to see where the pixel kind of fits in with
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   that.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:15.880]   Oh Jason's frozen shoot that freeze yeah you're back now because I'm using that tablet
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:23.160]   start using a real computer exactly what where you know where I think it'll be using
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.760]   this see what the pixel see is where does it play does it you know does it try to take
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.480]   Android and turn it into a multitasking operating system because as Jason how it was
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.520]   saying you know surprisingly what people may may not realize is you can you can multitask
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:43.880]   pretty well on on a Chromebook you know now the Chromebook pixel you know like these guys
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.520]   are talking about it.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.440]   You can multitask on an iPad you can multitask really does Android do such a bad job of
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.400]   multitasking I mean you just think it's more about full screen full screen full screen
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.800]   I guess right yeah it's more about having more than one thing on screen at once because
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:06.920]   I will say you know since iOS 9 and since all my apps so like Word and Slack and tweetbot
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   are all updated to support all the split view screen stuff now I am using it a lot more
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:17.680]   to do work if maybe at this point it's only just to see if I can use it for work but but
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.120]   it's a lot more possible than it was like six months ago even.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.080]   I'll tell you one issue which is the tabs in the chrome browser on Android are a pain
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   in the butt.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.080]   They don't display.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.920]   Yeah right and you have to go to them and try and they'll add up to be a hundred of
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.000]   them and it's a pain.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.360]   Yeah these things are easily fixed.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.320]   I've been saying a lot though on the radio show that we have to get out of the mindset
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:48.200]   of oh you need a computer you need a general purpose machine like a Windows or a Mac machine
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:53.520]   because to give it to make it a general purpose machine you have to make it so much more complex
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.200]   which makes it more security more of a security risk.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.400]   It makes it more difficult to use it makes things break more easily and more and more
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:07.000]   I think people the way people really use technology a computer's general purpose computer is the
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.800]   wrong thing.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.040]   I'm not sure a tablet's the right thing I think you're right.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.120]   I think this is why I knew you would join the chrome.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.160]   I have joined the chrome crowd.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   The chrome.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   The chrome.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.600]   No I need but even your phone is a better tool in many cases.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.880]   I do agree that tablets and phones tend to be more consumption focused.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.760]   Chromebook can actually get work done on.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:34.560]   For Twitch folks who don't know my rantings on Twig I've now been my only computer my
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.400]   only only only computer other than one used to talk to Twig.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.400]   Because we make him use Skype.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.920]   Because I'm using Skype.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   Thank you Microsoft.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.920]   Sorry.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   Is a Chromebook Pixel.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.280]   It's been what almost two years now.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.280]   Two years.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   Wow.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   I think you're in half two years.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   Whatever they can.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   And you don't feel constrained.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.800]   Of course you're a writer and a professor a lot of the stuff you do could be done very
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   easily in a Chromebook.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   You don't do video.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.960]   I can't do so well but I don't do any video.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.440]   No I think so and I think that a lot of people don't do the kind of heavy duty stuff
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.160]   you need a general purpose computing platform for.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.160]   That's old school.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.160]   That's the way it used to be.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.320]   And we just we just haven't gotten out of the habit yet.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.880]   Although I have to say I really wonder what the future of the tablet is.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.520]   I just don't feel like the tablets are much except watching the movies.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.720]   Which one I want airplanes it is good for playing games.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.680]   I think on the way back from Medellin my tablet my I think I've been I walked around
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   all the city with my Nexus 7 in my bag and I think I got smashed or something and didn't
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   work.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   So I'm in a panic.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   I've got eight hours of travel.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.040]   All I've been I'm in horrible hotel Wi-Fi.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.320]   I'm downloading movies and shows on my phone and trying to get on to my laptop.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.560]   Oh I'm not my battery power.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   I got there.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.480]   I got enough on.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.200]   And so happened I had I feared the Nexus 7 was going to be discontinued.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.560]   So I bought one in 2014.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.760]   Oh you had an extra.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.400]   I had an extra that's sitting there.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   On you.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.840]   That's just that's how neurotic I am.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.320]   And a boy did it take about 20 reloads.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.400]   But anyway on the trip back yeah I was at the panic but that's what I really use it for
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.720]   a lot is watching movies.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.600]   And it's by seven inches perfect the right size.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   I love it.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.680]   But is it worth carrying around?
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.400]   That's why I'm thinking the Pixel C if I use that as my briefcase machine when I'm
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.600]   out at meetings or that kind of stuff or I want to plane.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.760]   Okay the question is if I'm going to be gone for a week I probably can't take that.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.760]   I've got to take a bigger machine.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.320]   But if I'm gone for a day.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   Oh.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.800]   I also think that convertibles like the Pixel C or the surface are more of a I don't know
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.120]   hybrid that from a company that's just not reluctant to throw all of its eggs into any
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.400]   one basket.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.360]   And they are not quite I don't know I don't I just can't bring myself to use a device
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.280]   where the keyboard falls off.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.000]   I just feel like it should be attached.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.400]   I mean I think my laptop's getting smaller my phone's getting bigger right like I'd rather
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.000]   watch on this.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.400]   Or is that Nexus 6?
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   Right.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.240]   It's the Moto X pure.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:14.000]   So you know with those things I agree like a lot of it is for watching movies and entertainment
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.880]   or you know one app kind of things.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.800]   I mean I think to get to your point though Leo is that the funny thing is people use
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:29.880]   the you know most people use a small number of apps three to five I think is the average.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   And so if you only use three to five apps then tablets do have tablets are kind of almost
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:41.240]   there for you to be able to do a lot of what you're doing or a Chromebook same thing you
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.880]   know you can do a lot of what you do if you're only doing sort of you know what you spend
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.600]   most of your time on three to five different things.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.800]   But more and more as you sort of the phones get bigger have gotten bigger.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   All of a sudden we realize you know it's good enough to sort of do most of the stuff
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:05.200]   on that and it's always with you and you're you know you're logged in and you you know
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:10.840]   you have it you know relatively convenient battery life being one of the challenges of
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.320]   course and that's why another reason why tablets have suddenly got a lot of momentum is because
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.120]   they can have a lot bigger battery in one of those suckers.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:23.720]   So I do think that tablets are getting squeezed where they are where we are seeing a lot
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:29.760]   of use is again they're becoming more appliances tablets are that sort of one app two apps
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:35.360]   app appliance where you go into a business and you hand it to someone at a doctor's office
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:41.920]   to fill out their their sign in information where somebody can go into you know a restaurant
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.200]   and they can fill out and they can join your mailing list where they can sign in and get
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.600]   there do their reward stuff you know with just that one app that runs all the time on
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:59.520]   a phone and the tablet is just kind of a it's a mule it's a donkey it's an appliance
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:07.000]   it's yeah yeah so LA Unified School District very famously raised a bond to buy more than
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:18.360]   40,000 iPads at a cost of $768 each and the program as you know huge flop they were suing
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.440]   Pearson the education software company that was creating the curriculum school systems
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.760]   said teachers never use it we don't use it they were suing Apple saying we should have
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:36.120]   never bought it they were suing Lenovo also had charged the company the district for Pearson
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:43.280]   curriculum they've settled and this is a very weak settlement if you felt like you wasted
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.440]   your money on the billions of dollars billion plus dollars on the iPads they're going to
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:55.720]   get six point four million dollars in a settlement from Pearson Apple has agreed to pay four
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:02.320]   point two million dollars in a settlement so most of them did this on plague I argued
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.360]   the time they share a book terrible terrible terrible terrible far better a third the cost
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:13.200]   keyboard and the whole web is there for you awful decision the amount of money doesn't
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.520]   make up for the damage to the district's reputation or compensate for the amount of time lost
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   by students and educators in this miss begotten project said a member of the independent committee
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:29.880]   that oversees school modernization and construction bonds a big time mistake here was they went
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:36.000]   with a text a textbook company textbook company textbook companies are as disrupted as newspapers
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.360]   right and they're trying to hold on their own way by selling this expensive overpriced
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.760]   junk to you where when you have the whole world's knowledge organized for you by Google
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.200]   thank you all you need to do is get to it teachers didn't get training they're very limited
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:56.920]   training the product released by Pearson that the curriculum was apparently not very usable
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.720]   or very good and it just that what a mess what a mess all right let's take a break lots
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.480]   more to talk about Andrew Cunningham is here from ours Technica how many words in that
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.920]   El Capitan review why I'd have to go back and look but I think it was I think it was
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:17.760]   thirteen or fourteen thousand not quite not quite Syracuse to ask but I think he crossed
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.400]   twenty thousand frequently didn't he yeah usually yeah like twenty two or twenty four

[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.400]   angle on this is a little touchy and I'm gonna bring this up and I'm gonna let you guys talk
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:58.480]   me off the ledge reason being I just read a couple of weeks before this a study see if
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.640]   I can find this from the American Psychological Association of the impact of violent media
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:10.640]   over on the dock it's at the very bottom there yeah the impact of violent media there
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:16.320]   we go time has the article but it comes from the American Psychological Association was
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:24.040]   a review of research going way back they published this in August 2013 it was a task force they
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:31.040]   reviewed a hundred studies on violent video games published between 2005 and 2015 they
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:37.320]   concluded playing violent video games can increase aggressive behavior and thoughts we've
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:44.000]   always said there's no study that proves this and yet over a hundred studies show that
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.280]   lessening empathy and sensitivity towards aggression nobody saying it turns you into
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.800]   a violent criminal if it did I would be a violent criminal and you would be a violent
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.720]   criminal and you and you and you would be but it not me I don't plan but I'm the most
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.800]   violent crazy guy here but I have to say I feel like we live in a world where violence
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.040]   on television on movies and video games is so commonplace and so brutal that we have
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.760]   endured ourselves to it and you know while there's a of course many calls for gun control
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.080]   and stuff but it is a cultural problem and it's more than just controlling guns and I
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:24.040]   wonder if this is something we as a as a technology community should consider or is
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.800]   it or is it censorship I'll let you start Jeff because I'm sure you're a First Amendment
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:34.240]   guy a correlation not causation right you take you take a sickle like that in Oregon
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.560]   or we can name the ones every two weeks in this country but they're mostly by the way
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:44.760]   young men who played these games right but but it believed me the game didn't make them
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.160]   go out and do this no these guys had problems yes I mean I'm getting this and I know what
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.480]   I'm about to say you don't want politics in the show because I know the email you get
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:41:00.240]   but I gotta say it the problem is giving these crackpots gun 14 guns legal access to 14 guns
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.320]   if he didn't have legal access to 14 guns could he have taken a knife to somebody could
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:11.720]   take his car to somebody yeah but 14 guns this was all had 14 legally acquired guns that's
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:20.280]   far more the problem there are sickos nut jobs hate filled idiots in the world and the
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.920]   more we give them weapons the worst that is video games don't make them into sick but
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.880]   I feel like they may be training vehicles they may teach you how to be how to do this
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:37.200]   and to give you a kind of an ideation that that encourages this kind of behavior but
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.640]   it is a first-member issue because I don't know what to do to stop it but but maybe we
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:46.120]   need to take some responsibility it's so easy to blame guns but maybe it's a larger it's
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.400]   not just I agree it's guns but it's not just guns before that it was television before that
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:56.520]   it was movies right and if you and if you watch um um he'll give me a violent movie once
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:02.280]   his name was the crazy guy who did um Tarantino thank you Tarantino right so should we ban
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.160]   Tarantino should we should we how he has the right to make those I would of course he
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.480]   does yeah does that turn people even if it inspires one person suppose that the inspires
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:15.480]   even if there are similarities even if they did the sicko admired that movie it is absolutely
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   a case of correlation not causation as absolutely no real scientific proof it says this is
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.320]   gonna make someone do what they do these people are sick beyond sick violent beyond violent
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:33.120]   murders as murderers and no silly no TV show no book no movie no video game none of that
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:39.080]   is gonna make them do what they do and I refuse to get caught in the trap where we start saying
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:44.200]   this and you know this goes back to Kipper Gore and and music music was gonna make you
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.960]   do horrible things music was gonna make you kill the cops every single immediate that
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.480]   comes out somebody wants to control it and that is thank god why we have a First Amendment
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:57.000]   and and at the end of the day if you think that people are such incredible sheeple that
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.320]   they can be changed by these things and you're right Leo you would you already would have
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.880]   killed a hundred people yeah I don't think it makes you a killer I think it endures you
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:09.480]   to violence I think we are so bathed in violence on television and movies and I agree I don't
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:15.080]   it's kind of I'm not suggesting that we censor but maybe self censorship maybe self sensitive
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.800]   medium really it happened when movies were violent and their efforts are controlled out
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:24.120]   it happened with TV shows oh my god this is gonna ruin civilization it happened with music
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.960]   and now it's happening with video games and and I don't think it's ever been shown that
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.880]   media have this real impact and you can say that it makes us love empathetic but again
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.880]   is that correlation to causation who is drawn to video games with people who have no life
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:48.320]   sorry just a joke guys just a joke I like video games right I mean so who's to say again
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.640]   like you can't you can't argue causation okay yeah I mean it was interesting I was watching
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.480]   an old episode of the West Wing not long ago and they went through this big argument
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   you know among the whole White House staff right in this episode and they're saying what
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.840]   are we doing they're like we're talking about gun control on Tuesday and on Wednesday we're
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:11.720]   going to this big Hollywood fundraiser from this guy that makes all these violent movies
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.720]   and the one person the staff was like saying this is ridiculous like how can we be talking
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.880]   about you know violence and then the next day we're taking money from this person this
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.040]   glorifying violence and they didn't really come to a conclusion but but it's the same
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.280]   it's the same they were having exactly the same arguments right it wasn't the point is
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:35.440]   it wasn't just video games it was also so it's it's it's we yeah we're bathed in violence
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:42.680]   all the time and I just don't I can't believe that that doesn't have an impact on us does
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.800]   it glorify I mean you should have to come back I agree like it should not be legislated
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:54.360]   I it's I mean with between the first amendment and the second amendment it's very difficult
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:59.360]   to think of a scenario where we could legislate it anyway no you can't and I wouldn't want that
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.520]   I mean everybody has a right to do their art but I just I would like people to consider
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.280]   maybe the impact of their art and what let me go let me go let me do it but there are
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:14.440]   very few non-violent video games almost all video games are about killing I saw I saw
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:19.480]   the Emily Blunt movie last night you know it's a violent movie violent movie that's part
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.440]   of what it is let me do the devil's advocate to what I know you're doing is double advocating
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:27.320]   right now I'm not actually I'm really kind of serious about this but but let me do a
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:31.280]   double's advocate anyway okay I would argue that if we become too controlling and too
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.720]   protecting we take people away from the judgments they have to make an understanding fact from
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.480]   fiction understanding fantasy from not there's a woman named LaDorca Naze in New York who
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.880]   used to work with her the Daily News who wrote a book called free range children free
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.640]   range kids she got into all kinds of crap because she let her eight year old run the
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.280]   New York subway saying kid go out and we're in the world it's okay people just went crazy
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.760]   and and the over protection that I think we do of our children and of society the nurturing
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:04.640]   and nannying I would argue in the long run is more harmful because you will encounter
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:09.520]   bad people you will encounter violent urges you will encounter anger you will encounter
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.680]   these things and you need to be equipped to know how to control those things and to
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:18.280]   know what is just play or what is just release and what is reality now the sick F's who've
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.760]   done what they've done obviously do not have that ability but they didn't have that ability
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.120]   anyway this certainly wasn't going to push them and a normal person learns those things
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:32.080]   and and it's not a bad influence I think to have these ranges of life and good and bad
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.680]   in front of you if you try to control everything too much you probably hurt the mature decision
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:43.760]   making of society the long run do you want to weigh in on on this and you're wisely staying
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:51.200]   away just I think I mostly agree with Jeff on the issue just I think that guns are big
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.520]   part of it I mean we just we you see you have video games you have violent media you have
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.640]   all the stuff in other countries and yet this is the one where this kind of stuff happens
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:07.280]   with this kind of regularity and yeah I mean it's awfully simply you know what I mean I
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:11.640]   mean I'm not anti gun control I'm not I'm not working for the NRA but it seems like a
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.800]   simplistic fix I know it worked in Australia I know it works in other countries but it
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:22.200]   doesn't seem to only addresses like this kind of physical manifestation but what caused
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.800]   the rage will cause the anger it feels like there's it's got to be more than just say
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.880]   well if you didn't have guns you wouldn't have this problem you mean these people wouldn't
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:35.320]   be sick and angry and find other weapons well I mean there are there are weapons and then
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:39.680]   there are guns you know we're talking about knives before you could kill people with knives
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.200]   but it's slower it's a little messier kill as many and it's just it's a whole different
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:50.600]   sort of sort of thing and you know talking about the specific video game Switzerland
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.120]   Switzerland gun ownership is only almost universal mate we don't they don't see these
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.960]   same rates of mass murders nowhere near it yeah I mean there there aren't simple answers
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.520]   and that's what I mean I feel like a weasel that's a weasel copy of it's true I mean this
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.680]   this piece tries to make this link specifically between video games and violence but how do
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.160]   you like isolate video games all by themselves maybe the issues in the first place maybe the
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:19.080]   issue is we don't know how to treat mental illness very well maybe the issue is I mean
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:24.520]   there could be a lot more to this it's it's that and guns but the two the two are obviously
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:31.720]   a lethal combination it's also you know there is no society in the world or in sort of the
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:38.440]   history of humanity like America right there there are no there's no place in on earth where
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:43.400]   you have so many different people so many different kinds of people put together living
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:50.280]   next to each other having to coexist and that have you know lots of differences that really are
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:58.600]   only bound together not by ethnicity not by geography but by this idea right of of the country
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:03.560]   where that's based on sort of a certain amount of freedoms and you have all these different kinds
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:09.640]   of people you have all these different kinds of backgrounds and they're living next to one another
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:16.600]   and they have all these freedoms and so in some sense we should we should not be surprised that
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.560]   it's the most violent society on earth which essentially it is you know going if you look at
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:28.360]   gun deaths whereas these other places like Sweden you know like other places they are very homogenous
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:34.680]   societies right most nations in the world are very homogenous societies or they have two or three
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:40.280]   different types of groups and often those two or three different types of groups you know are
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:46.520]   creating or committing you know often sadly crimes against one another and having to deal with
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:53.320]   you know centuries old debates you know here this is still America is even though it's 300 years old
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.880]   you know that's just a blip on the radar right this is still an experiment in trying to understand
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:02.520]   how can you bring so many different types of people together and figure out how to live together and
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:08.120]   build a you know a good society and deal with all these kinds of things have freedoms but also have
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:15.720]   security also have safety you know and and these are part of the the growing pains of building this
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:19.160]   kind of society we still haven't figured it out right there's still a lot of things we have to
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:25.880]   figure out and this is one of the biggest ones and there aren't any there aren't any easy answers but
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:32.040]   but like I think the worst thing we can do is throw our hands up and say you know it just happens here
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.040]   no no no I agree we got to find out and that's I guess that's where this conversation
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.840]   okay from that and the fact that in the first four months of this year Australia banned 220
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:51.240]   video games in four months including douchebag beach club drunk drunk driver and hobo simulator
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:57.000]   but they wouldn't do that to go if you had a video game that endorsed and explained and
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.200]   instructed in absolutely everything a book that did everything the video game did we wouldn't think
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:09.480]   of banning the book that would be godwin's law time yeah right book banning is different isn't it yeah
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:16.760]   but not video games because they're not considered art and expression shows yeah all right I realize
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:23.240]   I'm being a caveman in this but I just I I bothers me I feel like I mean clearly we've got to find
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:28.040]   it we got a finite solution is right and you're not going to be in a caveman Leo I think you're
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.640]   doing the right things like we have to have dialogue we have to figure you know we have to
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:36.280]   throw out different solutions we have to figure it out because that's part of living in a free
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.560]   society a multicultural society like this is we're facing you know unprecedented challenges and
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:46.840]   these kind of things we have to have dialogue to work through it I see a lot of kids uh spending
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.920]   seven or eight hours a day in front of screens of various kinds some of them this video games
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:56.360]   some of its TV as well a lot of it's very violent and I just can't believe that that doesn't have
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:01.480]   an impact I don't I'm not saying I know what the solution is but uh well you raised the two
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:05.000]   points and again I don't want to get in trouble with letter writers and oh I don't care I okay
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   but I get the letters no matter what so it is really it does be obvious hanging fruit here
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:16.360]   is mental health care and guns in the combination of the two yeah yeah and I think we need to I
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:22.280]   think we need to bake a more civil society I really do yeah I don't know how you I have no idea how
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:27.880]   you do that part of the way you teach people that is by showing them extremes and having them build
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.880]   a judgment to deal with that yeah I think I think that we become far too protective and I know I'm
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.640]   sounding I'm sounding like a libertarian there I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat so you can attack me
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:44.200]   on that if you want to but uh I I think we become you know nanny state I I come to agree with now and
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.960]   I think well in Orson Aesys right I think our children became too protected so they didn't have
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:54.760]   as much ability to judge um you know we we scheduled every minute we we put a cocoon around them
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:53:01.240]   and I'm not sure that's the right thing to do in 1956 I love this link from the chat room
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:05.000]   Santa Cruz banned rock and roll yeah
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:15.400]   for for much the same reason by the way the music was detrimental to both the health and morals of our
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:21.800]   youth and community the ban was issued following a raid on a dance hall at the local civic center
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:27.960]   where officers claimed teenagers were engaged in quote obscene abandoned and highly suggestive
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:35.800]   dancing to the provocative rhythms of an all-negro band this thing can only lead to juvenile
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:40.520]   delinquency and degeneracy and will not be tolerated in the city of Santa Cruz now I went to Santa Cruz
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:51.640]   high 15 years later and things have changed quite a bit but in 1956 we have a problem with rock
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:58.280]   and roll in children can you imagine well yeah look what happened to them can you imagine if you
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.600]   could have you could have airdrop them into like the 1990s like hip hop or something I think I think
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.560]   if anybody from 20 years ago or 30 or 40 or 50 in this case years ago would be horrified
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:12.120]   if they came here and they turn on the TV and they saw the games the games by the way
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:18.200]   are they're very very real and vivid they're much more so than they were even a few years ago
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:24.600]   uh and now you know one of the reasons this kind of came to mind is I was watching the bullet train
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:32.520]   demo at the Oculus Rift this is a VR game where uh you I'll show you if you don't if you don't
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:39.560]   if this doesn't scare you a little bit um then uh I don't know uh what will this is from epic
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:45.480]   um let's see that's not it let me that's actually the actual bullet train
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:52.840]   what you're getting at Leo is the real the real issue is with people that make these things right
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:59.400]   and and you know I'm not gonna tell him not to but um watch this is uh this is pretty violent so
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.440]   but but at some people say oh this is the greatest game ever
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:13.560]   and this is by the way in virtual reality so you're in this environment
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:19.400]   and then I watch this and a week later I hear about what happened in Oregon and I just feel like
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:25.720]   gosh darn it can't we do better but you're you're making a correlation there that you have no
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:32.360]   no evidence no proof of the causation okay that's that's that's that's that linkage is critical
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.200]   because just because they happen at the same time doesn't mean no no no I don't think he was
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.800]   even playing this game it's not available yet I thought I did all but I'm saying that I feel like
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:44.840]   it's a cult there's a cultural thing going on somehow in this country I just worry about it
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:51.960]   we all should the idea it's the idea of being frustrated right there there are lots of
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:56:01.000]   frustrations in modern life in modern society and you know the conclusion is can can you get rid of
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.920]   it get rid of those frustrations with with the violence right that that's one of the
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:09.800]   the options that's one of the alternatives and that too many people especially in America
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:18.360]   are taking and how do we stop that how do we change that and uh good question a very hard question
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.680]   and maybe there's nothing nothing will happen because we can't solve this and we'll just see
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.120]   what happens we're gonna take a break I'm sorry to have brought up such a downer
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:34.040]   you point out Leo well you're the downer only I only say that because it's traditional in that
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:40.280]   tech media never it's it's considered never to be done in any way criticize violence in video
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:46.360]   games it's just but I just wanted to maybe take a chance there's there's one one more there is
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:52.760]   there is it a way which which has a responsible game maker you define responsibility and yes you
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:56.440]   need to do that I won't want government doing it for us I don't want it done externally but you
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.040]   can decide what you think is good and bad and it's a company that produces them you can decide
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.720]   what is good as bad as a producer as a publisher you don't necessarily publish you don't publish
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.600]   everything that comes to you um and everyone along the chain can make their own responsible
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:13.400]   decisions and that discussion is important and I agree with that yeah but the answer to this is
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:20.040]   not to say let's now control that process let's improve that process agree completely and just
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:25.640]   in case you were wondering here's a video of a Japanese live streamer accidentally burning down
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:34.920]   his hat house on twitch uh while streaming a game on twitch and you could watch this live
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:45.560]   boy she's on twitch.tv oh no I know we should ban twitch then uh yes twitch burns down houses
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:52.920]   twitch causes fires he's he's pouring water from his soda bottle on this
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:58:00.920]   this poor dude I think it actually gets worse as you go oh no that's going on oh Jesus
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:09.000]   anyway I'm sorry uh holy you see I told you they're dangerous
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:16.600]   I want to talk about amazon doing something kind of stunning and I help you all can explain why they
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:21.560]   did this let's get serious let's get serious something more important but first let me tell you
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:28.760]   how to use your time more effectively with stamps.com stamps.com just crossed a big milestone 1.5
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:35.800]   billion dollars in postage printed by stamps.com customers and I think a lot of times we do this
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.960]   ad and people think oh I'm not a big enough business it's not for me you know even a small
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:44.680]   business is going to benefit from stamps.com you don't want to go to the post office if you're
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:50.440]   if you're a sole proprietor you can't take time to wait in line at the post office and here come
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:55.640]   the holidays and it's going to be more time more time spent looking for parking what when you can

[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.720]   think oh you mean like Pitney no this is not a postage meter this is so much less did you know
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:11.960]   I just found that that postage meter it costs 1000 times more than inkjet ink which costs more than
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:19.320]   anything I know you don't need a postage meter your computer and printer or all you need in stamps.com
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.720]   you'll save at least 50 compared to a postage meter you won't have to waste time going to the

[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:59.400]   we are not going to sell Google's new TV video streaming devices we are banning them from Amazon
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:06.280]   because of course Amazon has a competing device but I always thought Amazon was a retailer maybe not
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:14.760]   man this is a bad move it also makes me feel like what one amazon could sell lots of those other
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:22.120]   devices right because you know what business are they in yeah yeah they say they will sell them because
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:29.400]   those platforms don't have amazon's prime video app on them well who's fault is that right yeah
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.800]   that was my immediate reaction was that yeah in literally a month we'll have an apple tv where
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:39.960]   the only thing standing between amazon and a prime app on apple tv is amazon and I think on the
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.720]   crumb cast that's already the case like they could in theory develop one and have it work great and
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.320]   they just have opted not to do that you could make a case that maybe apples keeping amazon streaming
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.720]   video out of the app store or off the TV you can make that case but you can't make that case with
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.800]   crumb cast because anybody can develop a crumb cast app with a crumb cast button Google doesn't
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:05.640]   have to give you permission it gets accused of antitrust behavior and and market must behave
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:10.520]   when it's not Google opens up these things and enables and and I think it's shameful behavior on
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:16.360]   amazon's part it's a bad sign for the future of internet tv too that these things are going to
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.320]   become these entrenched you know kind of three-way platform war which is bad for consumers we don't
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:26.520]   need man so bad for consumers right you don't want nobody you don't want to have to have you know
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.840]   two or three devices just to get you know this mix of content that you already have or
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.920]   you know so it's it's just a bad sign for the future of internet tv that's what that's what
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:41.480]   bummed me out the most about it was like oh great now we're into this real three-way platform
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:47.960]   war whereas amazon really had the best chance of being the the one player who played across
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.800]   all these platforms right which could have really helped them i think which could have ultimately
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:58.680]   sold more devices for them in the long run but um but yeah it's it was it was just a dumb move on
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.160]   their part yeah i mean that's the reason that i use kindle for ebooks instead of anything else
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:09.000]   is because i can get that on my iphone and ipad and nexus and windows and like every other device
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.680]   that i can think of i can read those books and i i wanted them to keep doing that with prime i
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.760]   wanted them to keep being like the neutral party but apparently they've decided that there are
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.920]   another one of those companies that needs to be all things to all people. Freckleson in the chat
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.560]   room points out that amazon's always said customer comes first we're customer obsessed
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:32.920]   we're customer focused well they sell from competitors like crazy they show you the prices
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.840]   of people who are selling these at lower prices they give you tons of options
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:42.920]   and here obviously they're not customer obsessed they're they're uh they're amazon's streaming
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.800]   discussion that you and i've had often lio about where where you argue that google's the content
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.280]   business i argue they're not yet but amazon is most certainly in the content business suddenly
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:59.640]   that's no it's provably true yes is it possible though andrew that amazon wants amazon streaming
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:05.480]   to be available on crumb cast and apple and there's some technical reason that they can't do that is
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:13.960]   it is it possibly not their fault i mean if hbo can do it yeah who who can't do it like i i'm
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.160]   struggling to think of other video services that want to be available on these platforms that can't
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.680]   for some technical reason like if they really wanted to i think that they could get there
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:28.120]   it seems very odd that they're blaming that they're saying well we don't want to sell anything that
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:34.520]   doesn't carry our service but what isn't it you that are preventing that they haven't they have an
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:42.040]   ios app they have an ios app and tvos is just ios it's the same underlying operating system on both
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:47.640]   devices so i i don't i don't understand what the technical barrier is i mean i think this is pretty
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.360]   obviously a scapegoat reason and i just don't want to sell these things that that are competing
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.360]   with their own devices one of them number one things i've wanted i've wanted all along is to have
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.920]   amazon streaming on my crumb cast because then everything i want would be on it everything i need
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:08.760]   would be on it show times on it now hbos on it netflix of course kulu plus uh if if they would just add
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:17.160]   chromecast to the amazon video app i'd be so happy and apparently that's never gonna happen now
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:24.360]   and uh it's like beta versus beta max versus vhs the consumer is gonna be stuck between to uh
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:31.800]   unmovable objects it could deepen this is one of those moves it could deepen the line the lines
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:36.840]   were already starting to be drawn right and i this could this could sort of deepen some of those lines
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:42.440]   i i don't know like like jeff said you know google has maintained uh openness here and and hopefully
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:49.160]   they'll continue to um you know apple of course is on the other end of the spectrum um you know
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:56.040]   completely closed probably it's not it's not out of this out of the realm of conceivably that
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:04.760]   they're sort of blocking an android app or or uh whatever um or wood uh potentially uh but like
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:11.720]   what we've talked about on the show before even if amazon did do it you know it would be it would
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.840]   probably be less it would be less fully featured and you know amazon's not gonna want to give apple
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.680]   a percentage of its content like apple makes you do you know give you 30% of sales so even if it
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.360]   if there was an app it was likely to be one of those things where you have to buy your content
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:32.360]   outside of the the app and then you know bring it in and that's not necessarily a terrific experience
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.520]   so maybe this was academic you know maybe this was one of those things that you know was destined
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:44.040]   to happen but amazon just had the chance to be that one platform um content provider uh that was
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:49.800]   gonna that was gonna play uh across you know different ecosystems so that's why i think this
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:54.040]   this matters and it does matter because you know internet tv is coming on strong and it's
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.840]   gonna be big big business i understand why they did it because platform this platform thing
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:05.240]   um as a content provider is a multi multi billion dollar opportunity right and they essentially
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:12.200]   are choosing um they are choosing that multi billion dollar opportunity ahead of sort of being the
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:18.360]   the one that just makes um the the sort of nickels and dimes awful pieces of content that they're
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:24.120]   selling everywhere you know who really benefits is not amazon but roku seems like it's just yeah
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.920]   wow well okay so the only the only thing that you can't do on any of these devices except
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:40.040]   in apple tv is iTunes right and apple makes sure of that yeah yes um but you can do everything else
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:52.120]   except apple on a roku right yeah um can you do anything else on amazon's fire platform i can't
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:57.160]   vote sure i feel like roku is now the most complete offering and all amazon's doing is throwing
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:03.480]   business to roku by the way of course you could still buy google stuff from google and apple
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.880]   stuff from apple and other retailers as well it's not like sure it's somehow going to prevent
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:13.400]   people from buying it it just feels a little petty and weird but once you're in there you know you're
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:19.640]   just locked in more than ever right if you means you start buying you know your stuff from google or
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:26.280]   apple or amazon now you know you're you're more than likely stuck you know there um because you
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.880]   know if you moved one of the other ones you're not going to be able to get your stuff now you
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:40.760]   could move from you know fire tv potentially to roku or to chromecast um but but not to apple tv but
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:47.720]   you know with the lines being drawn between these platforms um i i don't know i i do think um to
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:53.000]   get to the roku question i do think that that that i have a roku is number one right now 34
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.480]   market share it is it is i do think that amazon fire tv is much easier to use than a roku i you know
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:04.840]   roku is what i used to recommend to you know sort of people that weren't in this already and we're
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:10.600]   just looking at that so roku looks like the like the neutral player now right they do there's true
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:16.200]   i see so that's why you're saying it helps roku looks like the most grown up of the bunch
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:24.120]   yeah that's true but amazon fire tv is much easier um to use of all these i have what i never
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.480]   installed it i just had seen the show i have them all their voice activation is really good they've
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.480]   done some good work with the voice you can just click that microphone button and you know talk to
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:40.600]   it and it makes me work it makes me mad that companies sacrifice customers interests uh
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.160]   to create these siloed environments and you know you look at contrast this to microsoft
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.720]   which used to do that and now just says we're going to put our apps everywhere our customers are we
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:56.360]   don't care that it's on an ipad desperation is the mother of japanese yeah i was just going to say
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:01.720]   like the thing that roku does not have the apple google amazon have is like something else that it
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   does so like it can't afford to make anybody upset it's not it's not going to play these it's not
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:11.960]   going to play these games and roku does have voice search it's not as good apples tv's roku
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.720]   voice search will probably be the best when it comes out i'm guessing i think you're all heading
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:23.640]   in the really important part which is a change in the in the ecology of distribution yes we're
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.840]   seeing this on the text side you know instant articles allows you to go to where the readers are
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.560]   google this week according to recode uh i can't say anything more but i'll be there when they
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.560]   announce whatever the recode said they're going to announce is going to enable easier distribution
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.920]   of kind of news content and other web content um you got to go to where the readers are you got
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.040]   to go where the viewers are you have to where the people are rather than always making them come to
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:51.640]   you what's missing though in all of these structures is and and i think i've talked about a company
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:57.480]   called repost before where if you make content embeddable the benefit is oh free content you can
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.800]   bet free content but what we don't do is we don't value the creation of the audience we don't share
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.600]   revenue at that level too and if we did if we had a marketplace both for the creation of content
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.160]   and for the creation of audience then it can find its own water level then you can do deals and say
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:18.600]   okay so if you bring us enough audience says amazon great i'd love to have your app there um and
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.520]   but amazon still controls too much about saying well because we own the content that's where the
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.880]   value is no there's a lot of other people who will be happy to distribute the amazon content
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:34.360]   and there's a deal to be done so is amazon uh shortsighted doing this are they not i think so i mean
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:40.200]   bezo sees it because obviously he had to authorize the fact that washington post and the paper he owns
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.760]   is going to put all of its content onto facebook right and there's a benefit there but he's going
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.040]   to make money on it because there's going to be ads there there's new distribution there there's
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.280]   new value there and i don't know what else was done to get that super deal done between washington
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:59.640]   post and facebook um but yeah we're still trying to keep an old siloed media world where you had to
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:05.240]   go to the theater you had control over things and and and as it shifts and i think it shifts pretty
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:12.040]   radically um and i'll be able to talk about this more on wednesday on twig uh we'll see a lot more
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:18.120]   unusual deals about audience i think speaking of the washington post i think they got a little uh
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:26.680]   uh suckered that's probably a good word by people this we we're still not sure about this this is
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.960]   the yelp for people the idea is it's an app they say will come out next month
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:39.560]   uh julia cordray uh one of the app's founders says people do so much research when they buy a car
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:45.880]   make these kinds of decisions why not do the same kind of research on other aspects of your
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:51.000]   life it's a it's a a yelp for people in which you can take somebody as long as you know their cell
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.840]   phone number and rate them online uh her co-founder nicole mccullis says as a mother of two in an
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.400]   era when people don't always know their neighbors she wanted something to help her decide whom to
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:10.680]   trust with their kids a horrified article by katlin doey in the washington post in the intersect column
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:15.800]   shocking she even said oh people won't be able to remove their names there'll be no right to be
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:22.760]   forgotten um and of course you could have what doesn't take much to imagine a horrific outcome
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:31.400]   to p w p l e except a number of people think this isn't even a app that there never was an
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:40.360]   attempt to make an app and that the julia cordray and uh her uh her co-founder we're just making this
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:48.920]   up for attention nicole mccullis snopes even tried to get to the bottom of this snopes.com where they
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:58.360]   debunk rumors couldn't prove that it was a hoax but they kind of feel like there's a lot of evidence
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:04.520]   including the date april first on its twitter page which has since been removed that this was a joke
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:11.160]   they didn't mention the platform they didn't say is it androids at ios where it's going to come out
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:17.400]   uh let's go build it what do you think maybe maybe maybe they want somebody to do this and
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:24.040]   they're trying to get somebody to do it um anyway if you read the snopes article i have to say i
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:31.160]   feels like the washington post maybe was uh was uh horn swaddled sucker punched
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.520]   fooled by these two let's take a break we have more coming up lots more to talk about

[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:21.960]   there's nothing more romantic than a than a guy in a skirt in a plaid skirt he's a highlander
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.880]   from 18th century scotland and it kisses like a madman
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:31.080]   we all i've got a killer i've got a killer audible recommendation oh good what do you got
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:39.240]   yes so uh it's this book called um brief making a bigger impact by saying less it's by joseph mccormack
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:43.960]   is that a show it better be a short book very short book it is it's it's only like five hours
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:50.840]   so uh but i just saw this guy there's a there's this great event last week called idea festival
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:59.240]   which is kind of like a far less expensive version of ted um i like that joe gave a talk there and
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:03.000]   it's here in lulville it's an international event lots of people we know that you know that have
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.360]   been on the show have talked there before like bertunde thirston and molly wood but it's a lot of
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:14.120]   like it's people from nasa it's all kinds of um you know innovators and artists and and uh great
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:19.720]   great great folks um idea festival dot com you can learn more about that but joe was there and gave
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:26.600]   a talk and it was one of the um it was one of the best uh talks i've ever heard at any of these events
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:33.400]   if i listen to this the whole network falls apart i'm gonna write a book called longer
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:42.680]   longer but the actually you're you know everybody that that even comes on your show can can benefit
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:48.280]   from this because it's about sort of the three ways um we live in this age when we're just
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:53.480]   uh you know absorbing so much information right and he talks about the fact there's this great
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:02.360]   stat where he talks about the fact that the human brain um can process about 750 words uh
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.280]   a minute i guess it is but we can only say about 150 right that's right that's right yes
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:14.040]   a lot of times your mind wondering it's why people speed up podcasts speed up audiobooks right um
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:19.000]   because you can stand more i always talk about fast like get more in get more in yeah get more in
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.720]   so so is this isn't brief this is talk faster it well it's more about finding ways you have a
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:32.040]   very small if you don't make a point quickly people's mind wanders and they fill up those extra that
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:37.960]   extra gap with just other stuff yeah and so he talks about ways to make an impact by saying less
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:43.080]   and he talks about speaking in headlines talks about you know email um the ways you send email
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:48.360]   the ways that you speak to people you know um the ways to prepare to make your words matter
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:54.040]   more uh and it's funny at this at this event almost everybody's you know written a book that
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:58.040]   that speaks right and afterwards they're out there signing their books and you know they're
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:03.400]   selling their books and stuff after the um after his his was the only one that sold out in like 10
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:08.600]   minutes like everybody ran from the audience afterwards and went to buy it because it resonated
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:16.040]   so much with you know trying to make a point um not just in uh you know speaking like he was but
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:21.800]   in communicating in everyday life it's what we teach journalism school right yeah right right
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.240]   lead to say what you're gonna say write the nutcraft don't be what it's about get to the point
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.200]   put the important stuff at the end let people leave if they want to yeah very fast joe mccormick
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.800]   brief make a bigger impact by saying less you can get that for free you can actually get
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:41.400]   two titles for free really some of the fun of audible is picking those two every every month
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.480]   I get to pick two more because I also have that subscription the two book a month subscription
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:49.640]   you'll also get the daily digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:55.160]   and you can cancel anytime in the first 30 days paying nothing but that book will stay yours to
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:01.960]   keep before you go see the Martian do me a favor read the Martian and rc brain aerates is beautifully
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:07.320]   really well done yeah really brings martyred waltzing to life uh so many good books here it's
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:12.680]   hard to just pick two let me if i may add yes you know plug in here I was also through audible's
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:21.720]   recommendation that I got to pimsler and as to the auto as my goal uh they have the dosa messes

[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:07.720]   there uh there's a lot of stuff to talk to um i think we've done ad blockers to death no need to
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.760]   talk about anymore although jeff you did write a good article on saying that really the onus is on
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.320]   advertisers and advertising to fix this problem and i was in media to fix advertising but that's
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:23.240]   pretty much the yeah i'm of it yeah and you quote yeah putney swoop which is ill remembered but
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:28.600]   one of the great funny movies of the sixties it really is yeah i'd forgotten about this
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:39.160]   by robert downy senior yeah who's also forgotten yes the sun has eclipsed the father anyway recommend
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:47.560]   the article as usual jeff writing on um medium and you could see i've had a number of underlineings
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:53.240]   from people i follow on medium and a lot of common it's too i really like this uh feature
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.920]   medium it's ability to have a conversation around your words it makes comments much better you know
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:04.360]   because they're right there yeah right there yeah yes this i put the same post up as a note on
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:10.600]   facebook using the new ah through note uh structure yeah doesn't have quite the functionality that
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.680]   medium has yet but it's a lot more elegant gives you more control than just a post
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.000]   yeah a little more permanence so it's it's interesting to see where this goes i love it that f
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.640]   williams underlined this at a minimum advertising must not annoy and must must must also be transparent
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:31.640]   you know what made me think of when i actually went with this whole conversation lately um because
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:36.440]   obviously we've been thinking about it too oh yeah sure as impacts your bottom line yeah absolutely
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:42.520]   is i do a lot of research um you know historical either i've always got some kind of project not
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:48.120]   just writing a book you know but sometimes other sort of history kind of project is being a history
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.880]   lover and a lot of times that ends up being one of two things uh that are both fun reading dead
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:01.560]   people's mail um or uh looking up old newspapers is that legal yeah right that's what archive
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:07.400]   are full of archives are full of dead people's mail right letters old letters but but the the
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:12.760]   newspapers are the interesting part and what's you know useful in this case is when you go back
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:18.760]   and you read old newspapers and you look at the advertisements um they're actually as interesting
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:24.840]   especially his you know from a historical perspective as um as the copy i love him right i love him
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.680]   because you you learn so much about what was going on at the time and what people's priorities were
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:37.720]   and what they were interested in and what sold and maybe what didn't sell um and um as you do
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:43.400]   about anything and also if you look at the ads a lot of times they're um they're much more personal
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:49.560]   um they're they're more akin to something like one of the the ad reads that you do Leo then they
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:55.720]   are to this modern um they're not so slick yeah they're not so slick they're features and benefits
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:01.960]   and you know they're folksy and yeah they are and so there's this there's an audience like they know
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:07.560]   that they are delivering a message to an audience and they're you know interacting with them in a
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:14.360]   more personal way in in one's in a sense and so that that's one of the elements that's missing um
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.240]   especially in online ads which is which are much more you can tell obviously about a numbers game
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:26.520]   it's about uh you know volume and and that's where we've kind of lost course and where um you know
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:33.800]   advertising has has lost its way especially on the internet is that they're not about addressing
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.680]   an audience they're not about providing you know information they're not about sort of uh
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:43.400]   engagement they're they're more about volume and numbers and so when you read the old stuff do
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:50.280]   i'm looking at google news then google newspaper archive which is really fun it is um also the um
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:55.960]   the library of congress uh has um an amazing archive of of old newspapers and those are a lot
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:01.880]   of times not the um the big ones but they're the more smaller community kind of papers right um
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:08.440]   it's well going back to um the 1800s early 1800s um and and yeah you can you can read them on google
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.600]   now oh obviously i still i still go to libraries and look up microfilms there are some that you know
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:18.120]   haven't been digitized yet um you know i i'm very thankful to the college students who spend
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:23.240]   their whole summers uh digitizing these things it's a very boring job but extremely important
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:30.120]   um and so uh you know thank you if you're an intern out there uh that spent this past summer um
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:36.520]   digitizing new newspapers uh we appreciate it uh so yeah it's it's super useful and i do think
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:41.800]   it's instructive to kind of where we're at right and that advertising has to change it has to
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:47.480]   you know become the more um useful again more purpose didn't banner ads really weren't they
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.600]   kind of the the webs equivalent of display ads and newspapers jennifer i mean that's kind of what
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:58.600]   they are well and billboards on the street too just just depressions right right impressions
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:06.840]   impressions oppressions um all right well there you go speaking of f williams twitter everybody's
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.840]   saying now looks like they're going to have a ceo and it's going to be what jack dorsey
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:17.640]   uh that seems a little odd jack's uh of course one of the inventors of twitter and one of its
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:25.880]   in fact he's been twice fired as ceo of twitter times a charm times a charm uh also run square and
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:31.640]   has said many times i i won't do uh i won't be ceo of twitter unless i could be a ceo i'm not
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:37.240]   leaving square the twitter boards of course said many times but we don't we want a full-time ceo
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:43.640]   well the latest and this is from carris swisher of course who knows everything everything uh and
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:48.920]   a kurt wagner writing for recode that jack dorsey's expected to be named the peter permanent twitter
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:54.280]   ceo feels like twitter is just an amusement at this point it's just so much fun to watch this
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:31:00.280]   it's not a business horror movie horror movie and my my fear is i think adam bane
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:06.040]   is much respected much loved the sane person in a company that desperately needs sanity he's
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.000]   the star chief revenue officer my fear is they could lose him you lose who doesn't get the job
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.480]   yeah and and they've already lost tons of executives through all this turmoil
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:21.320]   and according to the recode bane is widely expected to be promoted to coo
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:24.120]   yeah well as a little you know here's a bone
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:29.240]   uh if i'd go higher adam in a second i adam i used to work with him years ago in advance
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:34.200]   uh but you know if i'm another technology company i'd looking for a ceo at higher adam bane away
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:42.440]   yeah what is twitter makes money it's not it's not you know it's not losing money
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:49.880]   why is twitter in so much trouble why is it just they're just under pressure to keep growing and
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:55.000]   growing and growing into infinity right and there are signs that growth is slowing or it's not as
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.400]   healthy as it needs to be and that makes the shareholders nervous and there you go never go
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:06.040]   never go public folks as it's biggest as it's biggest problem it's biggest problem as a public
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:15.160]   company for twitter is that it's not facebook um and you know facebook is uh you know is a money
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:21.160]   machine the way google ad um you know ad sense was a money machine and ad words were a money machine
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:28.200]   a decade ago right um and twitter is not that twitter is something different uh it is social
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:34.360]   media but it's a different kind of social media um and it's not necessarily something that is as
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:40.360]   easy to understand right away still as what um facebook is done i think twitter's done a lot of
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.840]   good things i think product wise i think they've they've had some misses but facebook has misses
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:49.880]   all the time too um i i think that they've done some good things to try to make it easier to use
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:55.240]   to try to surface more content to try to surface older content um and they're doing lots of good
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:02.200]   things but i i think it does have um it does have certain limits in terms of of audience it's still
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:08.600]   a huge audience it's gonna be uh it's gonna continue to be really important um i think for a long time
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:14.200]   but it's not a money machine um it's not a money machine the way google and facebook where and i
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:20.760]   don't know if it ever will be um the ad click rates you know click through rates on ads on twitter
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:27.800]   are significantly less than um than facebook um it's not it's still not a fantastic ad platform
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:34.600]   and maybe it's still it's part of the same discussion of um how do you how do you how does
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:41.000]   advertising work uh in in the modern digital world and facebook hasn't um facebook has kind of cracked
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.760]   it um and much more you know holistically than than twitter has twitter's still trying to figure
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:51.960]   it out they really haven't figured out the the formula um yet and and that's their problem
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.880]   that's you know once they figure that out and i think they probably will you know they'll make
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:59.720]   more money they'll make a lot more money i don't think it'll ever be facebook though it's so amazing
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:04.600]   because well there's an article uh by farhood mongiou in the um new york times this week or is
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:10.280]   talking about twitter in effect saving television i mean who would have thought that a few years
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:16.760]   ago yeah because of live uh live madness because they're they're talking about scandal uh every
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:21.640]   thursday since the show's premiere most of the scandal cast crew have used twitter to add live
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:27.000]   commentary that runs during the broadcast and this has inspired hundreds of thousands of tweets
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.120]   from viewers every broadcast and has been credited with with not only deepening the program's
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:36.760]   relationship with its audience but i think probably the ratings when i was down in midi and i talked
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:43.640]   with a journalist from um chile who did an amazing all the troubles in chile from years back there
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:50.040]   was a dramatization of it and so this journalistic site decided to drew a fact based version of what
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.000]   was going on they used twitter as the show was going on and say this is what really happened this
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:58.920]   really happened but i don't know huge huge success brought tremendous attention uh twitter's an
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:05.160]   amazing tool but it's still not the world that's the issue yeah they he talks about jashua malina
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.200]   who i've followed on twitter for a long time i really liked him uh in the west wing going way
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.840]   back but nobody malina himself says i'm not a star i'm a working actor nobody knows my name
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:22.280]   people kind of know my face but i'm not i'm don't have fans but he says as 25 plus years into my
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:28.120]   career and it's only now because of scandal and twitter that people know my name and i have fans
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:33.560]   but he is he's very smart he's been using twitter for years he's on vine he's on periscope
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:40.280]   he uh he is an example of an actor who's been working for 25 years who's worked you know a lot
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.480]   but who has now finally been able to use social media to actually crack into the top tier right
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:51.160]   uh i think that's interesting it's not just networks and shows the benefit it's it's talent too
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:58.600]   yeah i do think twitter needs a full-time CEO i'll be honest i think twitter twitter is a big
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:05.560]   challenges um and you know no matter how good jack dorsey is and if he is the right person for
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.800]   the job there's a reason why the board wants him to be full-time CEO like they have a lot of
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.200]   problem they need a leader who's gonna really um be there and lead and that doesn't mean that
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:20.520]   jack dorsey can't be the figurehead company can't be the guy's been here before it's not like he
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.920]   hasn't had his voice heard at twitter does he have the vision to turn twitter into whatever it is
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:30.280]   that twitter needs to turn into i mean i think it's good the way it is i don't think yeah i i think
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:39.480]   they need somebody twitter challenges i i think i i i are more um i i are more blocking and tackling
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:43.960]   right like it needs to get product right and you know it's nailed that it needs to get um you know
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:49.880]   figure out advertising i don't think it needs it necessarily a huge product visionary um you know
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:55.640]   to push it forward uh you know it's good doing what it's doing it just it needs to do business a
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:01.960]   little better it needs to run its operations um better and it needs a lot of attention to do that
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.040]   you know jack dorsey's a great leader he's a great figurehead i think he's amazing as the face of
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:10.280]   twitter i think he's amazing talking about what twitter is and and why it's great but he can do
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:17.160]   that as executive chairman um and i i think if if they do have the kind of brain drain um like we're
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:22.120]   talking about at the top and they kind of already have had some then you know that ultimately could
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.280]   especially with with him becoming ceo that could ultimately hurt them you know maybe what the best
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:34.280]   case scenario is him coming in being full-time ceo for um you know another for for a year or two
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.760]   and then bumping back up to executive chairman and whoever you know the ceo oh maybe that person
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:43.880]   they're grooming the person for ceo to sort of take over full-time maybe that would give you know
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:50.040]   wall street some more confidence in in twitter uh well i think it's ceo i love it i think but i
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:54.600]   think you're right when you said it first which is they need a full-time ceo and if this is just a
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.720]   transition to that then wall street's going to be impatient what's the strategy figure out your game
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:04.200]   get it done i don't think it was against jack necessarily but how can you not be distracted with
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.720]   two companies yeah you can't and when is when is by thing i would imagine more of his
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:15.480]   he has a much more well put this way he has a much much larger stake in square than he has in twitter
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:21.800]   yeah i mean once he dies i just i feel like twitter is a success and it just baffles me that it
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:27.720]   seemed it's deemed to be uh in trouble and that you've got to bring in this guy to save it when it
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:34.520]   seems like kind of you can't go anywhere with that scene a hashtag and tweet us it is it gets
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:38.520]   compared it is when you compare it to facebook right that's that's the biggest well that's face
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:45.400]   focus everything is a failure i'm a failure to do facebook doesn't put me i mean i'm in trouble
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:50.360]   it's all right i mean that's a bad company to compare yourself to they have a billion and a half
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:56.520]   users i couldn't agree more i couldn't agree more right nothing is facebook or will be for some time
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.160]   but but twitter's never wall street's the problem isn't it that's really the problem these guys
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.800]   expect too much from companies well wall street is people right people wall street is investors
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.800]   wall street is people that believe that that invest in things based on what they think the
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.800]   future is and people look at the future of twitter right now and they're not real sure and for good
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:19.000]   reason and and i think when you look at the fate future of company like facebook or google you know
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.200]   you're pretty certain they're going to be around in five or ten years and probably making a lot more
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:26.760]   money than they are now twitter it's it's hard to see and that's i think that's why i think why wall
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:32.760]   street doesn't isn't sure what to think about them and and i think we're all we all agree it's going
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.320]   to be around but i think even we're not sure you know how will it change how will it
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.760]   you know make more money and i think dorsey he's gonna you know if you're the CEO of two companies
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:48.120]   like it's hard to do it equally you know when job was the the head of apple and pixar he was
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:53.720]   dedicating most of his time to apple he had people at pixar that were already by the time he was
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.440]   doing that he had people that were running pixar he was making executive decisions and his job was
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.880]   to go in and you know and you know punch people in the nose in hollywood and you know make sure
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:08.920]   that they got a good deal and he was really great at it uh and other than that he didn't really run
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:13.560]   the company um you know other people ran the company jeff jennifer they aren't this twitter
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:18.840]   doing like a news thing everybody's doing a news thing that's a safe thing to ask everybody's
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:27.000]   doing a news thing what is twitter's creating um it's curated yeah it's curated and and things
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.640]   are again i i it's not what people want from twitter is it
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:36.120]   i i i well twitter people do their own
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:41.560]   what the board says is well what the market says is you're not big enough twitter so clearly
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:45.160]   you're not giving people what they want so what do they want figure it out and give it to them
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:49.720]   so now they flail around trying to figure out what that thing could be is it longer tweets is it
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:56.440]   is it curated people is it curated content um you know the rumors of what's coming out this week
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:02.920]   from google that have been published on recode um i think could make a huge difference in the way
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:08.040]   you experience content through links in a place like twitter i think a lot could change around
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:15.400]   twitter uh but the problem is that you see as a success but the market doesn't yeah yeah but uh
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.640]   is that how we is that really i guess we have to run the world that way because they're a public
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:24.920]   company and if they're stock tanks they can't hire people and then the whole thing spirals down but
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:32.520]   i mean i i i brought a bunch of german uh editors and publishers into places like vox and
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:37.640]   courts and other places like that and and and every time i brought them in one of the people
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.480]   those companies would say i know you're all on twitter but they pointed out the window they're
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:47.640]   all on facebook yeah yeah and in the media that's what you're paying attention to is what and
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:53.000]   facebook has so much more data about you it knows more about you it can it can target amazingly
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.800]   now you have google adding the new function that enables uh marketers to give them their
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.480]   email address list so that even through google you're going to be able to target directly um the
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:09.560]   number of i've argued that the the real industry these folks are in is signals and it's a war of
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:15.720]   signals and facebook has a tremendous war chest of signals that is to say data about people yeah
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.040]   google has as tremendous mechanisms like android to gather signals about you
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:25.640]   amazon has tons of signals about you apple less so and apple also is not really in the ad business
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:32.600]   so they don't really need it as much uh but but but those three companies facebook google and to
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:38.840]   an extent amazon uh in the advertising world they have the wealth of signals we in media have been
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:43.240]   stupid we don't have relationships with people so we don't have those signals and twitter it has
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:47.800]   some signals but jean and japanese knows as much more about you than twitter does isn't that funny
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:53.400]   yeah there's really using it as well yeah yeah yeah we lost you andrew but you're i think we got
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:57.640]   you back yeah i've been told that i'm back you're back is there anything you wanted add to that
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.960]   um no we were just talking we were talking about facebook and google earlier and i think the
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:07.080]   interesting thing about those two companies is that they've proven that they can change and grow
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:12.440]   and get into new things uh successfully over like the last decade decade and a half
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:16.600]   whereas twitter like they've got that one core product and if like even when they try to change
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:22.120]   anything about it like if they change the stars to hearts or if they increase the number of characters
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:28.360]   in a dm like people go the established users of that service go kind of crazy about it in a bad way
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:33.080]   and so that's another thing they've got a fight to as they look to grow is like how do they do that
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:39.880]   without alienating the people who are already there yeah yeah they're talking about increasing the uh
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.920]   140 character limit i don't know what you get though if you do that with twitter it's not twitter
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:50.280]   anymore that's that's it's secret sauce right like you know that's why it's that's why twitter's twitter
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.600]   why can't just be a little small business go along have 300 million users just be happy
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:00.600]   and i'm using public company when you're public companies right there's the law of gravity is
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:06.200]   different when you're a public company yeah i guess and i guess again let's let's emphasize
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.360]   how far they came i remember that i made it front of fennelson when he uh invested in it saying you
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:14.600]   know where's the business ball there's no business ball at their front and indeed it is profitable and
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:21.000]   and dick costalo did grow the revenue and grow the company impressively um with a hard hand and
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.680]   it needed it but um it's still i mean you know i the problem is you just can't count on what twitter
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:32.280]   is going to be i go back to i still am nervous about them based on the way they treated developers
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.880]   back in the day they they grew in the backs of developers yeah then they kicked the developers
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:44.680]   in said backs yeah yeah rans um uh just to prove your point uh by the way andrew ken from chicago
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:51.240]   just tweet it just uh in the chatroom said no i hate the twitter redesign of stars to hearts i hate it
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:56.920]   i think that's good when your when your users care that much about something like that that
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:03.960]   means that they love you yeah that's when i tell myself every morning when i read my twitter feed
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:08.120]   my preferred twitter clients are all the ones that make twitter act like it did like in 2010
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:13.320]   so so i'm if i'm the typical user of of your service like yeah i think you've got some problems
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.160]   that's how change results i use the mute button liberally and i'll mute somebody and then they
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:21.000]   don't know i've muted them and i just don't see them anymore in life it goes on it's a wonderful
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:29.000]   thing your stream can be so nice so pleasant uh let us uh take a break come back with more
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:34.680]   kind of the back of the book the silly stories japanese autonomous cabs things like that
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:37.160]   first though let's talk about disaster
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:44.520]   you never know when disaster will strike at work or at home storm fire flood or
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:51.000]   joey in the stockroom accidentally deleting the entire hard drive could put you out of business
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:57.000]   you got to back up i just it great it drives me crazy on the radio show especially i'm on the
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:04.200]   front lines of this guy called today so i have some legal documents on a usb thumb drive and i
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.760]   can't read it and i said didn't you have a backup he said yeah i had a backup but i can't read that
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:15.160]   he said you need carbonite for crying out loud how many times i have to tell you carbonite backup
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.280]   for business and home a million and a half folks have have finally heard the word maybe you should
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.640]   too back it up you install carbonite once you could forget about it well anytime you're online
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:30.840]   it's automatically backing up it's encrypted on the way to the server encrypted in place on the
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:35.240]   server but your data is there it's safe it's not i think of it it's like a data vacation
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:41.480]   it's in there in the carbonite climate controlled network operations center where
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:48.360]   breezes blow across it and it gets to relax enjoy probably have even a little tropical drink in

[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:28.360]   twit we're talking uh hi tech we're saving everybody can we save ever note apparently i didn't
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:33.720]   know this according to business insider now there is some debate over this not everybody agrees
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:39.560]   business insider says that ever note is falling apart of course they did replace philibin
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.920]   their ceo in july i like phil a lot i thought this was maybe phil's idea but now i'm getting the
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:51.160]   impression that it was the board who was a little bit worried about ever note 30 million registered
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:59.800]   users 270 million in funding um but they did have to lay off 18 percent of its workforce over the
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:06.200]   last nine months they're going to shut down three of its 10 global offices and i was kind of stunned
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:13.400]   their actual revenue of ever note is is not huge what was the number it was like 30 million dollars
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.240]   everybody thought this was the ideal model but a small proportion of your audience wants to pay
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:23.480]   for your real use of free they've figured out premium premium for crying out loud everybody
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:28.280]   thought they figured it out yeah yeah i feel sad phil would tell me oh yeah we got five percent
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:34.280]   become uh paid users that's enough but when your revenue for a company that size is 36 million
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:39.240]   dollars that's not a good sign a lot of server bills in there and they're only getting bigger right
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:44.520]   now i think the the lesson from the lesson from ever note and for all those people who are out there
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.320]   building freemium services freemium the model still works like it this is not uh i don't think
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:54.120]   this is an indictment on freemium um although there are some movements away there's some movements
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:49:00.600]   toward freemium there's some movement and then a movement away from your skype which is frozen
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:13.560]   so he looks so sad it looks like he's just moaning bimono oh Jason and then Jason skype die
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:22.840]   i'm sorry we shouldn't knock a man who's frozen that's mean i cross off look what you've done to
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:28.840]   a nice man before i feel like every time i can't use skype from my crow book by the way
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:36.200]   ah that's my face i i used to love ever note in fact phil once told me we had to fill on
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.880]   uh triangulation once told me that something like three or four percent of ever note subscribers
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:46.680]   or subscribe because they said they heard it about it from me i've been plugging it for years
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:51.560]   um and i use it all the time because it's cross platform and stuff and i pay for it but i guess a
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.920]   lot of i guess a lot of people don't pay for it they they say they have 150 million registered users
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:02.280]   uh but i guess a small percentage of those are paying for it and that's hard to run a business
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.760]   on that anyway good luck we want we wish you well
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:15.000]   um this was the week that alphabet was born we'll look up back on this someday and and and remember
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:23.320]   alphabet officially google officially kind of became alphabet on friday and they've replaced
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:29.160]   is this true chiff don't be evil with do the right thing i didn't know that but i kind of get
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:33.800]   i'm glad i didn't get rid of it i you know the problem what they basically did was translated this
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:40.200]   into a phrase that the very literal mind did can finally understand it's an action instead of
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:45.320]   what not to do it's what to do and and it's what they've all what it's always been which is
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:51.080]   employees keep us from doing the wrong thing make sure we do the right thing and you have a license
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:55.400]   to question our actions on this basis because doing the wrong thing would be bad business
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.760]   the alphabet it's always been what it is it's always been the intent but of course they get
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:02.680]   all this crap about the evil stuff but now you know what's going to happen i can i can write the
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:08.600]   speech for the german politicians gonna say google doesn't want to be not evil anymore now it allows
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:14.600]   itself to be evil it's gonna be evil it plot this is the uh i think this is very good at
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:19.000]   plep pr i mean these are just words on a page but maybe if the company really believes this that
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:24.680]   it will promulgate through the culture of the company employees of alphabet and its subsidiaries
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:31.560]   and control affiliates should do the right thing follow the law act honorably and treat each other
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:35.480]   with respect i think that sounds great well but it should be more than that i mean unless i
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:39.720]   i haven't read the whole thing you know what it should be was that's just the promise treat your
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:47.240]   customers first and foremost with respect do what they want you want to do that's that's what it meant
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:50.440]   don't ever screw them for the sake of the business that's what don't be evil then
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:56.840]   google's code of conduct used to have things like it's it's okay to drink a little alcohol at work
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:03.640]   but not too much and dogs are cool but cats are discouraged at the office i mean that's wrong
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:09.640]   that yeah that's wrong is it oh yeah crazy uh but that that harkens back to a google of an
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:14.760]   earlier time when there weren't so many employees i don't know uh i don't know maybe they'll have cats
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:22.920]   now but that's uh but yeah so alphabet officially became the entity but no ferrets no no ferrets
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:28.120]   that's something we can all agree on yeah yeah now they're pretty cuddly you know it's illegal to
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:32.600]   have a hedgehog in california it's illegal to have a ferret in new york city well it should be illegal
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:37.320]   i have a ferret in new york city well no it wasn't what's wrong with a hedgehog i don't know
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:47.960]   more stage fright bugs oh man uh this is for google and i like android i really do uh but
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:55.240]   this is pushing people towards ios um more than a billion android users are vulnerable stage fright
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:53:03.480]   is the media player in all versions of android um and the security reaches imperium labs that
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:09.640]   discovered the original stage fright bug has found a new one two new ones that can allow hackers to
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:17.160]   break into your phone uh by tricking you to either download uh or visit a website containing a malicious
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:26.760]   mp3 or mp4 the stage fright playback engine will play it and you will be pwned this affects almost
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:32.600]   almost every android device since the first version of the operating system in 2008 even
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:39.960]   android 5.0 and later at least 950 million android users there is no fix although
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:45.240]   uh google which knew about was was warned about this problem before it became public
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:50.600]   is apparently working on a fix and we'll put that patch out uh in a couple of tomorrow i guess to
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:56.840]   a nexus phone users and they shared the patch to partners uh a few weeks ago so that they can get
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:00.440]   those out but that's a problem because there's different manufacturers different carriers it's
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:04.920]   always difficult to get the bugs bugs pushed out stage fright took a couple of months to fix
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:10.120]   and now there's the new stage fright uh so be very careful i guess
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:17.480]   about um uh you know if you're on an android device none of them have been patched yet about
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:24.440]   playing mp3's or mp4's from unknown sites yeah again unfortunately the problem is less with
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:32.440]   any one bug and more that there's no reliable like guaranteed way to get this update out to
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:36.120]   everybody who's got an android for right now like i'm i'm sure there are tons of android phones
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:39.720]   out there now that still haven't been patched for the first stage fright and google's doing what it
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.120]   can but it's not up to them unfortunately they don't they don't keep right they's the way it's
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:50.360]   structured they don't get to unlike apple which gets to push updates out to all iPhones if it needs to
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:55.160]   yeah is that a read now do you use an iphone andrew or a google device
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:55:01.160]   um i use a little of everything right now i'm um iphone and nexus tablet but a lot of time i'll
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:05.560]   switch back and forth just just so i'm up with everything yeah i do the same thing although i'm in
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:11.720]   love with the new iphone success plus i may fall in love with the google 6p you better
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:19.560]   i got my new moto 360 watch and i do like it better although i have to say both both motor
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:27.000]   roller and both the android where and apple uh watches are really supremely useless devices
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.840]   they have one purpose at least the apple watch has one purpose to signal that you're part of the club
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:39.960]   and that way you can recognize each other on the street you have the new moto 360 i do it's nice
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:45.560]   i'll i'll i'll bring it on Wednesday okay good it's well this one's really different it's huge it's
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:52.680]   46 millimeters but they make other sizes as well um and same i have a 42 is that the other size yeah
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:56:01.160]   there's a female 42 a male 42 and a giant 46 right uh but i just thought if i'm going big i'm gonna go
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:08.760]   all the way i have been risk worse has been said about me you can get the ladies what if you wish
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:16.280]   and now a malware tool that has your back semantics researchers have discussed discovered a
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:24.760]   new malware tool called linux y-fatch that compromises home routers and other internet
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:32.360]   connected consumer devices and patches them it semantics as the malware is infected tens of
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:37.480]   thousands of routers and other iot systems around the world they've seen it for the last two months
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:45.400]   it seems in fact to be designed to harden devices for instance on some devices it turns off telnet
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:52.920]   which is an insecure communications module it tries to prevent other attackers from uh
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:57:00.200]   using other other known vulnerabilities in so it's a good it's a good malware still
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.400]   in semantics that you give some made malware yeah make yeah it's bizarre
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.880]   um the code is in is unobfiscated in the clear as if the author wanted people to know what they
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:17.880]   were up to but as semantic points out it's still a piece of code that infects your device without
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:24.760]   your consent it does have general purpose back doors that look to be for updates to add other
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:32.520]   features any malware features but could be used to add bad stuff um it's just bizarre
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.760]   it is a uh and because mostly because people who use routers never patch them never think about it
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:47.080]   so uh so i'm i'm guessing some you know benign hacker made this thing and spread it around
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:53.880]   uh set a couple of sad stories speaking of hacks patreon was hacked uh
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:58:01.560]   unfortunately kind of a nasty damn good and right in an ours technica about this is kind of a nasty
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:09.400]   story because uh apparently they had left a debugger running on a public facing part of their website
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:15.400]   and the debugger allowed arbitrary code to be run worse they were told about it five days before
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:22.920]   they got hacked patreon jack cottie's uh really really wonderful site that uh enables creators to
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:29.560]   get paid by their um by their users kind of a patronage system i know a lot of podcasters who
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:36.040]   use it um that's sad and now a 15 gigs of data have been released into the wild from patreon
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:44.040]   um once again i i we have to get to the point where someone having this data cannot do anything
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:48.520]   to you we have to change the transactional end of this not the data end well they know right thing
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:54.200]   is going to get lost they just they used they used they did the they used be crypts to encrypt the
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:59:00.360]   it's credit card numbers things like that passwords but so did ashley maddison and that was hacked so
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:07.960]   it's possible that uh even best practices aren't enough what do you see we know the data is going
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:12.360]   to get stolen so we have to protect the data where it's at so if it is stolen it's useless
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:18.360]   well that that too that's part of it but even even then we know it gets stolen from idiot companies
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:21.720]   we've got to get to the point where someone who has your name addressed birth date and secure
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:27.400]   and so we're screener we can't do jack because transistors are more secure no i agree with you
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:31.960]   and we've got to stop using the social security number as an identifier because it's so hard to
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:37.640]   change it's a permanent id number it's like your fingerprint once attacked you're screwed
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:41.880]   so we've got to change it with the fact that now we well of course finally america gets chips
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:46.760]   but we don't get pins on the chips right yeah uh yeah exactly it's like what
[01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:54.200]   chip and sign all that's secure and then t-mobile gets hacked but not really because it what happens
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:59.560]   is when t-mobile gets a new customer they send that data to experience which then approves or
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:05.480]   denies the customer based on their credit record experience got hacked and 15 million t-mobile
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:10.520]   customers information and so what a t-mobile do to make up for this they gave you two years
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:16.520]   uh subscription and experience service protection can we spell iron and
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:22.520]   inject your data it won't happen again right lightning never strikes twice that couldn't happen
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:28.600]   it could possibly happen so el capitan is out uh i'm already hearing uh from anytime you get a
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:32.840]   big operating system upgrade i'm hearing from people whose favorite utilities stopped working
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:37.800]   uh now i notice a lot of menu bar utilities stop working apple probably disabled the
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:42.360]   backdoor that these companies were using but on the on the whole i know you've written a lot of
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:46.200]   words about an android a good upgrade a worthwhile upgrade should people do it
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:51.000]   especially if you're already running Yosemite yeah most people are going to have no problem
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000]   with it um the the thing that i think a lot of people are noticing with some of those utilities
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:01.000]   and i ran into it myself with the um the tethered shooting app for my sony camera
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.920]   is that this new system integrity protection tool that stops the stops third party apps from
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:12.600]   writing to certain like protected system directories when you upgrade from Yosemite to el capitan
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:17.640]   it's going to move any files in there that don't belong somewhere else so yeah it's gonna it's
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:23.320]   gonna break some things especially if you have like third party drivers installed if you use
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.120]   any third party toolbars things like that yeah you might run into some problems but
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:33.240]   i've been using it since the pretty early days of the beta and like basic stuff like office and
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:40.280]   chrome and firefox and the other apps and things i've not had any trouble on my laptop especially
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.000]   i really like the split screen feature for full screen you know i've seen some people
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.880]   kind of making fun of the fact that we went from windowed operating systems to one app on a screen
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:57.320]   operating systems and now we're going back to windows but um when you use the multi-touch trackpad
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:02.040]   gestures and os 10 you can kind of swipe between these full screen apps really easily and so i
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:07.160]   like to have like all my i am apps in one window i do that i do that i have a couple i have like a
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:12.760]   chrome tab and a word app like in next to each other in another window like it's been really great
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:19.080]   especially for my laptop on my multi-screen desktop setup not so much but can't take that
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:24.440]   with you everywhere all right no i even i even use it on my multi-screen that means i have hundreds
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:30.920]   of desktops everywhere uh no it's a good update apple you know apples to be committed because this
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:35.640]   is a hard thing to do we're hearing so many problems with windows 10 uh microsoft seems to
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:41.480]   have rushed it out and despite a long public beta period uh you know lots of stuff's not working
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:47.240]   um one thing that microsoft does that's not working on here on elk happy 10 is microsoft office 2016
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:53.240]   do we know why that's that's not working oh if you have you had problems yeah lots of people
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:57.960]   saying problems works for me oh all right the most the most helpful answer that you can give
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:02.360]   i don't know what you're talking about works for me you must be something wrong with you
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:07.640]   it's very hard for me not to say that on the radio show all the time it's a holdover from when i
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:14.680]   worked in it right it works for me have you rebooted the computer is it plugged in works for me
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:22.600]   uh robot taxis where else the first autonomous vehicles japan of course they'll be using a very
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:31.080]   small area to take uh older people to grocery stores uh but i think this is great a robot
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:37.320]   autonomous vehicle initially i think they'll have drivers um you know in the cars but i think
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:42.920]   ultimately the idea is this will be an unmanned service starts next year it'll be available for
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:51.640]   50 people in the connagawe prefecture short south of tokyo uh but i think it's a start we're getting
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:04:00.120]   there you're in a jonnie cab someday someday i can't wait for this to go wrong and become a
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:08.520]   movie with will smith and i do it looking for sure i taxi boy japan still loves its robots you know
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:14.840]   i spent some time with honda earlier this year you saw the hasmo didn't you yeah and some of their
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:20.520]   researchers that that are working on um uh you know robots and that kind of thing i think they're
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.920]   kind of getting to the point where they've done really good with the with the mechanics i think of
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:33.160]   robots you know what we're really at now is the where we need the ai right to catch up um and that's
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:39.720]   why so many companies um like google and ivm and others that's where they're putting all of their
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:44.200]   their research and they're really changing they're thinking about the idea of what a robot looks
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:50.120]   like right some are humanoid robots like asmo um you know that i did some coverage of earlier this
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:56.600]   year um but i think people are also starting to think of robots in terms of special you know more
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:03.400]   specialty functions right and the ai attached to you know there's the one that is like an arm that
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:08.360]   can make dinner right it's just an arm and it makes dinner or it you know can do the dishes
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:12.840]   that kind of thing but it needs a lot of ai it's more about the ai then sort of the the function and
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:18.520]   this is the same thing with cars uh and self-driving cars or self-driving vehicles and this kind of
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:27.080]   i think the ai is full of this and we await the sense in humans yeah i just watched two um uh
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:35.880]   the ex machina um i like that movie yeah that was well done yeah and and encapsulates a lot of the
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:42.200]   sort of 50 years of or a hundred years even of thinking about once we get to the point where the
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:47.400]   ai works what does that mean it's going to go horribly wrong that's why that's why and that's what
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:54.440]   there's a there's a um professor uh um at the uh at the idea festival the event i mentioned that
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:58.920]   we were really covered last week and he talked a lot and we talked to him a lot he's a cyber security
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:03.320]   he runs a cyber security lab at the university to Louisville uh is one of the preeminent sort of
[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:09.000]   researchers in in cyber security um his name is roman um gosh i gotta remember his last name i
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:15.720]   can't pronounce it correctly if i did but um but anyway he was saying that you know all of these
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:19.960]   things are we're on the cusp of it like you'd be amazed at what we can do and what ai can do and
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:26.120]   he said where we're at now is we we need to start thinking um at this point of putting the guidelines
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:30.520]   in place the same way he said we need to think about the same way we do about chemical weapons
[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:37.480]   and about nuclear arsenals and things like that um because we need to put the the the guidelines and
[02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:45.480]   the frameworks in place for doing this research before it becomes um dangerous uh so he was a real
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:51.720]   advocate of that yes he was a real um he was real optimist in terms of how far um ai is coming and
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:59.560]   how fast how quickly but his his real thrust was like we've got to set guidelines and expectations
[02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:07.400]   and um frameworks for this kind of stuff we're gonna let you all go it's been a lot of fun
[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:15.960]   i uh thank you jeff jarvis we'll see you back here on wednesday here at twit are you traveling
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:20.680]   anywhere you're gonna be in town oh i'll be in i'll be in town amazing and i will have gone to
[02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:24.440]   a google event uh was in morning so i'll talk about it was good good good good
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:30.840]   andrew cunningham r's technica always a pleasure come back soon yeah thanks for having me nice to
