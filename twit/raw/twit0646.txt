[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech!
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.720]   The annual year-end episode on this Christmas Eve 2017 and I've brought our great Twit
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.720]   hosts all together.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.040]   Father Robert Ballisare, Megan Moroni, Jason Howell, we're going to review the big stories
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.960]   of 2017 and take a look ahead at what we think the big stories of 2018 will be next
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960]   on Twit.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.960]   Glad you're here.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:36.080]   This is Twit.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:48.320]   Bandwidth for this weekend Tech is provided by CashFly at CACHEFLY.com.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.640]   This is Twit, this week at Tech, episode 646 for Christmas Eve 2017.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.040]   The year in review.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.760]   This week at Tech is brought to you by Blue Bottle Coffee Get Fresh High Quality Delicious

[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.840]   Home plays a big role in your life, that's why Quick and Loans created Rocket Mortgage.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.880]   It lets you apply simply and understand the entire mortgage process fully so you could
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.600]   be confident you're getting the right mortgage for you.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.840]   It started at Rocket Mortgage.com/Twit2 and by GoToWebinar, a trusted webinar platform

[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.640]   Well hello everybody, happy Holidays Leola Board here and it's time for annual holiday
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.960]   edition of this week in Tech.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.200]   We're recording this a little early but as the earliest, you know, we'll release it
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.720]   Christmas Eve and I think many of you will be watching it in the week between Christmas
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.800]   and New Year's.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.320]   As we have done in the past, we've brought in Twit host this time though, we got the
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.160]   local folks which frankly I should have done right up front.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.960]   Jason Howell, all about Android.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.960]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.600]   Good to have you Tech News Weekly.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.920]   Wait a minute, show us, stand up a little bit and show us that sweater.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.680]   He's wearing that Coca-Cola polar bear sweater who's wearing an ugly Christmas sweater.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   You know, it's a meta sweater.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.120]   It's a meta, I love it, I love it.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.880]   Also from Tech News Weekly and iOS today, Megan Moroni is here.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.320]   I'll just shake my bells.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.560]   Both Megan and Jason regularly host triangulation and new screen savers as well.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   Yes.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   With me.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.560]   And your phone's ringing.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560]   Yeah, my phone's ringing.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   I guess I should turn off your silence or phones people.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.160]   No, you can leave your phones on a home.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.880]   Also Father Robert Ballis, the digital Jesuit host of this week in Enterprise Tech and
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.800]   KnowHow and he soon will be going, skying his way to Rome.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.920]   In fact, that's the big news of what we're going to do this week is cover the news, the
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.120]   big stories of 2017.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.760]   But for us, the big story of 2017 was that in 2018, Father Robert will be going back to
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   Rome.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.040]   I will be visiting Rome on a more permanent basis.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.240]   A more permanent basis or on a permanent basis?
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   It's about as permanent as we get.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.800]   I just move when they tell me to move and they don't want to move.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   But you do get to travel a lot.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   You got you worked a deal.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.400]   I don't know how you when negotiates with the Pope, but apparently Robert doesn't mind
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.080]   playing hard ball with the Holy Father.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.480]   And you got, I think the ability to go to some tech conventions.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   Yes.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   Yes.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.360]   So the way that we've worked out the arrangement so far is minimum of four events that I get
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.480]   to pick just anytime where I'll just be able to leave for about a week and go do my thing.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Every year?
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   Wow.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.480]   He's also.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.720]   Can I tell you, tell them about the thing you're doing, you're building?
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   Of course.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.240]   He's also building a studio, a podcast studio in the Vatican.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.240]   Yes.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.680]   A full featured podcast studio will have a 10 gig connection to the internet.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.000]   So it'll be relatively quick.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.360]   It'd be like, I'm going over in what, three weeks, I'll be in Rome in three weeks.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   And that's the start of it.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.560]   So I'm going to pick a room.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.360]   I need to find the, it's an old old place.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360]   Wait a minute.

[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360]   I'm going to pick a room.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   Disney has now acquired Episode 4.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   Oh, and the rest of Fox.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   But I think they bought it just because they only -- they didn't own all the Star Wars
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   movies.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   The first Star Wars movie is still on by 21st Century Fox.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   They have now that.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   They also get back all the Marvel characters that were sold.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   It's the Fox.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   They're going to start crossing these.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   I know.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   I was getting into the dread.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   They're going to do it.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   They're going to do it.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   They're going to see the Hulk in the Millennium Falcon.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   That will not be a wonderful day.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   Although at the same time, I kind of am curious.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   But I don't know.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   I think it's a bad idea.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   If Samuel L. Jackson returns, never mind.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   It's worth seeing.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   But what we're going to do today, I think, is go through the year and talk about the big
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   stories of the year.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   And each of you have different perspectives about the stories of the year.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   So I'd love to hear what you think.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   We could start in January.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   And by the way, for me, the big change happened December 2016 when I got my Surface Studio
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.360]   to change the way you podcasted.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   And this was all year I got to do the Twit with this giant touch screen computer.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   And I have to say, it's not necessarily the computer everybody should buy in their home.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   $3,000 starting price.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   Father Robert had to soup it up with better drives because they put terrible drives in it.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   But for what I do sitting here at this table, it's illustrating and everything.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   This is amazing.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   And it gets out of the way.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   It's kind of lies flat.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   So this was for me the year of the Surface Studio.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   I like that story just because this was one of the surprises.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.360]   And every once in a while, we get this out of Microsoft where people were saying, this is
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   the design I would expect to see from Apple, not from Microsoft.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   And in fact, that was the comment that you had in several stories saying, the Apple
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   Microsoft crossover where you've got a design that's so beautiful, they weren't so focused
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   on the specs which Microsoft typically does.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   Instead, they wanted to give a good experience.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   And this was an excellent experience.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   As you mentioned, Leo, it's not on everyone computer.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   Unless you're an artist or a podcaster, it's not the best device for you.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   But it did show people that there's a couple of things going on at Redmond that we don't
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   know about that might actually blow us away.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.360]   >> In fact, I think it's safe to say that 2017 was the year of the new Microsoft.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   >> That Microsoft really emerged doing things that the old Microsoft would never have done
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   partnering with Linux for its...
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.360]   They released laptops for the first time ever, the Surface laptop.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.360]   Surface Book came out the year before, but Surface Book 2 came out this year.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   Their hardware's gotten better and better.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.360]   In fact, yeah, I think it's an interesting new company.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   Of course, Microsoft released the creators update, the spring creators update early in the year.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   I think it was a good year for Microsoft overall.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.360]   >> Absolutely.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   I mean, a big part of that is kind of undoing this legacy thinking around how they run their business.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   Also, it seems throughout the year they've kind of relinquished their kind of clinging
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   to their mobile efforts and allowing themselves to be able to collide.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   >> That was a plug.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   >> That was a plug.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.360]   >> Yeah, I'll just say this is a plug.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   Figuring, being okay with the fact that they can be a software company on some of these other platforms,
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   and that's okay.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   They're doing that really well.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.360]   I know at least on Android, their apps are really impressive.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   Anytime they come out with a new app, I'm very curious to see it.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   They're doing it right.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   >> Same for iOS.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.360]   In fact, arguably the best apps on iOS and Android come from Microsoft.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   >> Absolutely.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   I'm going to push back a little bit on the creators update because they don't know that there was that much for creators.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.360]   I think there was a lot of- >> It was a funny name.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   >> Yeah, there was a lot of promise that I don't know if they really delivered on.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   I haven't heard of a lot of people saying this is a great operating system for me as a creator.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   I still do think that Mac owns that in a lot of ways.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   >> How much of that was, though, in response to Apple and Apple's kind of falling away from the pro market?
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:31.360]   I think pros were, in fact, we're going to have a story in March Apple actually apologized for making such a hash of the Mac Pro.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   I wonder if Microsoft looked at the turmoil among Apple users and said, "Here's an opportunity."
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.360]   >> Oh, I'm sure they have looked at that.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   But I don't know if they've delivered a better solution to people yet.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.360]   I mean, so this is great for podcasters, but I think it's really just great for the Way Leo Podcasts.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   >> Imagine any other way that someone would use this, but I don't know.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   I think I tried so hard to use the Surface Book instead of the MacBook, and I just couldn't.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   >> That's interesting.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:11.360]   >> Yeah, I really wanted to get used to something else, just to know another operating system.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.360]   I always go back to that.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.360]   Maybe it's muscle memory, I don't know.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   But yes, I do think this is beautifully designed, except for this dinky pen.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   It's still an ugly pen.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   >> I'm actually with Megan on that.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.360]   You know what would make that pen much better if you had to recharge it by sticking it into a USB pen.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   >> Yeah, that would be fantastic.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.360]   >> And why did Microsoft make it magnetic stick to the side of the monitor?
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.360]   >> It doesn't always stick.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.360]   I stick the Surface Book, and then pen always falls off, and I lose it.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   >> It does tend to fall off the Surface Book.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.360]   It's better for a desktop where you're not going to be shaking it around and so forth.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   >> Yeah, no, look, Microsoft's not perfect.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   In fact, the Surface had a lot of woes in 2016.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   By 2017, I think it had settled down a little bit.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   And I do think this, what it is is a story that you don't see much in technology, which is a company coming back from the dead.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   >> Right.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   And Apple's done a really good job over the years, I think we could all agree, kind of hedging their bets on the fact that not only are they creating, don't they?
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   They're creating devices that they say are fit for the people that are using it.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.360]   You're really made for the user, but they also create very beautiful devices.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.360]   Devices that you're proud to, let's say, pull out your pocket and show to people.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   I feel like this was a year where Microsoft really kind of-
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360]   >> Their laptops and their desktop.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.360]   >> Yeah, they kind of met Apple on that level.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   >> The good, they say.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.360]   >> You should be proud to use this and for people to see it.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   It's a beautiful piece of hardware.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.360]   >> It's funny, when we go back to January 2017, Apple was having trouble.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   Apple had a down quarter.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.360]   People were thinking Apple's going to struggle.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:47.360]   Apple said we're going to cut back iPhone production by 10% in January, saying the demand is off.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.360]   And there was this kind of sense that Apple might have been stumbling for the first time ever.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   We can look back in hindsight and say that was completely wrong.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   >> Oh, awesome.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:05.360]   >> It also began the year-long rumor, fest, about what was going to be in the iPhone, the new iPhone.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   We didn't know what was going to be called the iPhone X.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   >> X.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.360]   >> X, whatever you call it.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.360]   >> Where have we landed on that?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   >> No, it's the 10.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   >> I was watching Ellen the other day.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   Yes, I like Ellen.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   >> It's the 10.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   >> And Ellen, she goes up into the audience, I told you this, and she goes up into the audience and asks people for stuff.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   And she started asking for an iPhone X.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   >> And when Ellen says it's the iPhone X, I think that that carries a lot of weight.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   Apple might have some regrets over their naming scheme.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.360]   Let's go back to the beginning of 2017.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.360]   It began as all years do with CES.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   And CES was really, at least in our recounting, and I looked back at the old episodes, all about Amazon's Echo.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   Was this the year of the Echo in many ways?
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   >> I feel like it might have been.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   >> If you had stopped the year after CES, that's what you would have assumed, because it had gotten to that point where you had put the Amazon voice assisted into literally, literally.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   Literally, literally everything.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.360]   You could walk around, it was in refrigerators, it was in driers, it was in speakers, it was in headphones.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   I saw a Amazon voice assistant enabled pen.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.360]   And once you get to that craze where it's, no, we just want to throw this in there, you think, okay, I guess this is the trend for the year.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   Oddly, it didn't shape up that way.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   I mean, yes, it's big, it's important, it's a large ecosystem.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   But after CES, the bus just started dying off.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.360]   >> You went to CES this past year, you go every year.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   I did not go.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   >> I see.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   >> Don't angle so hard.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   Just make sure I don't actually accidentally press that button.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   See, this is exactly the way this hat jiggles is really kind of pretty kind of like it goes over and then it quivers a little bit before it falls back and forth.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   >> Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.360]   >> I think it's a repurposed big-mouth Billy Bass.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   >> Oh, I think he might be right.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   >> You know what, Father Robert, would you hack this and make it sing Don't Worry Be Happy?
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   We can do this.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   That's actually easy.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.360]   >> That's a good idea.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   >> I hope it's over.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360]   >> Oh, stop, stop overing me.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   >> Stop overing me.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.360]   >> Wait, wait, wait, don't push it again.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   No, there's no stop button, unfortunately.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.360]   >> There we go.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   >> Oh, thank God.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   I'm sorry I did that.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   >> It's okay.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   >> What else was it?
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Did you remember anything else at CES that, what's funny is we never do this, and I wish we would once in a while, look at CES and say all the stuff they announced was going to happen in 2017.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.360]   >> What happened?
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   >> That didn't.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   >> Right.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   You saw sort of the strengthening of the high resolution TVs.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   So 4K was definitely a thing, but they actually started looking at 5K and 8K in even a 10 and 11K for prototype.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:54.360]   And it was interesting because, yeah, they looked nice on the source material that they created specifically for that, but you had the same thought as you wandered that hall saying who makes anything close to 8K, 10K, 11K resolution source material.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   >> It's just never going to happen.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.360]   >> But that happens every time they announce a new technology.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   I remember when HD came out, there was no HD content, when 4K came out, there was no 4K comment.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   >> Right.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.360]   >> This was for sure the year that 4K hit big.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.360]   >> 4K hit big, but it wasn't really the 4K.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   It was something that came along with the newer 4K TVs.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.360]   >> I know where you're going.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360]   >> And that was HDR.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   >> High dynamic.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   >> Oh my goodness.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   >> I think that's because, look, we've gone through the high definition craze, and yeah, that helps.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.360]   It makes it look better.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   We've gone through the 3D craze, which I think that was a stupid.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360]   Yes, everyone.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.360]   >> In fact, 2017 was the year 3D TVs died.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.360]   Everybody announced no more 3D TVs.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   >> There was even technology out there.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.360]   There were TV manufacturers who they could have enabled the 3D.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.360]   It's like, yeah, our hardware was doing it.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   >> We just won't.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   >> We got to the Star Wars showing and they gave us the glasses and I went face palm, right?
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   Is it just me?
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   >> No, it's me.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   I don't want to.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   It's because there wasn't a lot of 3D stuff.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   I didn't see anything.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.360]   It's gimmicky.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   And it's like they say, well, we're going to show you this movie.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.360]   We're going to make you wear something and it'll make it 50% darker.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   >> Right.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.360]   >> Right.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.360]   >> That doesn't, and it was real, realty, which is the worst of the bunch.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   >> And I just really, please, just, they killed it in TVs this year.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   Let's kill it in movies next year.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   Can we make a pact to do that?
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.360]   >> Yes.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   >> No more 3D.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.360]   >> I'll let everyone know.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   >> No more 3D.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   But I agree with you, HDR is fantastic.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   And especially if you see side by side, like the same material in standard, but then in the HDR, you say, okay, that I want.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.360]   That actually does make a difference.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   That makes it look better.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   That makes it look fantastic.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   It makes it pop.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   I mean, it gives me a representation that I did not think was possible.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   And for me, more than a lex, so the HDR was the story of CES.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   It just didn't get reported that much because people still don't really have a way to describe it unless you're looking at it.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.360]   >> This Netflix came out with some really strong HDR content, including Stranger Things, too.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   Boy, that sure looked good.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:57.360]   If you could see those blacks, those dark, dark blacks, there was some scenes in it which I am convinced they shot intentionally for HDR.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:08.360]   I don't know spoilers again, but there's a scene that repeats several times where 11's in a very, very dark, a black room, but there's a spotlighted figure in that.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   You remember that scene?
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   >> That shows up several times, and it shows HDR because the dark is rich, velvety, very, very dark.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   No macro blocking, no errors, perfect.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   And then the stuff that's illuminated is very, very bright.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.360]   That requires HDR to really do well.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   >> I'm swiftly realizing we need to get a new TV.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   >> And your wife has said you need to do well.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   >> She's given the years.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   >> She made the comments.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   She said, "I think we need to upgrade in 2018."
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   >> This was the year America realized that, yeah, we need a 4K TV.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.360]   And frankly, the prices were so low, and almost all the TVs were 4K HDR.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.360]   Content started appearing.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   >> Content's the other really big component.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   >> The array players dropped in price, the UHD player dropped in price.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   So I think you're right.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.360]   I think although Alexa, I'm sorry, Echo got all the attention at CES, I think TVs.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.360]   This was also the year Zuck began his 50 state tour.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.360]   >> Oh, we all got to meet him and shake his hand because you got down on the ground and met all of us.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   >> And to people everywhere he went.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.360]   >> We got inundated with weird pictures of him looking like a robot or a monster.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.360]   >> Or milking cows or...
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   >> Yeah, he knows the cows.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   >> And early in the year, a lot of speculation.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.360]   I remember in January, of course, President Trump was inaugurated, Jan 20th.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.360]   Early in the year, because our minds were on the election, a lot of people were thinking,
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.360]   Trump's running for office in 2020.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.360]   I think that's died down.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   >> You mean Zuckerberg.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360]   >> Zuckerberg.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.360]   >> Well, I don't know what Trump's going to do, but Zuckerberg, I meant.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   Zuckerberg's running for...
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   >> He said many times he's not going to.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   >> But I think it did that kind of die down.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   >> Well, also, I mean, I think this was not his year.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   I mean, if any year or so to go on a tour, like this was the...
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   I mean, this was, to me, one of the biggest stories of the year is how our view of these tech giants really changed this year and how they themselves had to be pushed into the spotlight and make a stand, take a stand, take a side.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.360]   We're just so, "Oh, we're not a content platform.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   We're not making free speech, free speech."
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.360]   But then the world sort of pushed them and said, "You know what?
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   You have to decide whether you're going to let Nazis on your platform.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   You have to admit that you had a role in the election."
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   So they just were knocked off their pedestal.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.360]   >> They got beat up bad.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:29.360]   >> And when they come to the end of the year, it's safe to say that people are much more skeptical of Facebook than they were at the beginning of the year.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.360]   >> It's not just Facebook.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   They're much more skeptical of Silicon Valley.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   >> Silicon really is.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   Like I said, it's got the stuffing knocked out of it.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   >> And not technologically.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   It's just, it's kind of bust into the bubble of Silicon Valley.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   For the longest time, the country was okay saying, "Hey, you're driving all this innovation.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   You're giving us products we want, and you're making us a lot of money.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   So keep doing what you're doing."
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:56.360]   It was the year where they said, "Okay, we like those things, but the culture you've created doesn't exist anywhere outside of the Silicon Valley."
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   It's the year where move fast, break things.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   People started to realize you actually break things really, really badly.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.360]   Maybe it's a good idea to not break everything.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   >> You interviewed Scott Galloway in his book, "Was it the Four?"
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   >> Yes.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   >> He is the one who's, he's a presser at a business in NYU who said that this is the big four Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the big four.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   >> Apple?
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   No.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   >> I don't remember what the fourth is.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   >> Is it Apple?
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.360]   Are going to face government regulations that never before?
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.360]   What do you think?
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.360]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   I don't know that we are, you know, that we're at a point where you could really deny that that's the case.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   It really seems like that's the path that's been laid before.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.360]   The public, the users are holding them way more accountable.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   I think the government, you know, in not just the US, but, you know, in the EU and the US.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:57.360]   You know, in the EU and a whole lot of other places are starting to look at these companies through a different lens and realize, realize the greater effective of their kind of running ram.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   You're running the way that they have.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.360]   >> Rough shot over here.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.360]   >> Rough shot.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   There we go.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   I think it's inevitable.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:16.360]   And I really do, and I felt this at the beginning of this year where I started to kind of look inward on my use of social media and everything and be like, all right, so there's, there's some really great things that we've come to, you know, love about social media over the years.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   But there's also a whole lot of capability for that to be abused.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   And for people to be misled in very serious ways.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   And I think, yeah, I think there's no question that possibly in 2018, definitely sometimes soon there's going to be some regulations that hit these companies.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:39.360]   And that's probably their biggest fear because it goes counter to the way they've been able to run their businesses up until now and make an insane amount of money.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   >> We're talking about the year in review for our end of year show.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.360]   Next week, we're going to have a best of some of the best moments from a Twit.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   But I thought it'd be fun as we've done in the past to get together the hosts who make Twit happen and talk about the stories that made a difference to us.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.360]   We're all delicious.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   I don't know if you're all having coffee.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   Megan and I are having delicious cup of coffee.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   Megan, let me show you what we got here.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.360]   This is blue bottle.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   This is a single origin.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   Mexico, Oaxaca, La Cunyada.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   I have to say, our coffee has been upgraded.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   We have prestige up in coffee this year, thanks to blue bottle coffee, blue bottle coffee.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.360]   So delicious, so flavorful.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   You'll say, I've been drinking subpar coffee my whole life.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.360]   Get with it.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360]   Get the blue bottle.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   They started with an insane dedication to coffee.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   And what they do that makes this better coffee is a couple of things.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   First of all, they look all over the world for the most delicious, sustainable coffee on the planet.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   85% is certified organic.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.360]   Most of the blends are certified organic.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.360]   They take freshness really seriously.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.360]   That's a thing I think a lot of people discovered with blue bottle.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   The fresher the beans, the better the coffee.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   When you place your order online, the beans are roasted within 48 hours and delivered directly to you.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   So they're practically still warm out of the roaster.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:14.360]   And when you grind those fresh roasted beans and you smell that amazing coffee aroma, you realize, yeah, I don't want any more stale beans.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   I want the freshness.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.360]   No, no sitting on a dusty shelf for weeks.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   Or the worst is when they grind it ahead of time and then put in a can and they should put in a can.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   But it's terrible.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.360]   And don't worry about flavor, blue bottle has something for everyone's taste buds.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.360]   You'll even discover that there are different kinds of coffee.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.360]   Some people think all coffee tastes alike.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.360]   Oh, no, no, my friend.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   You get some lighter fruit forward profiles, deep chocolatey espresso.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   They have a nightlight decaf, which is the best decaf you've ever had.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   You stop sniffing.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   Oh, I swear.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   It's lovely.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   It's lovely.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   It's been dipping the coffee in a weird way.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   Mmm.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   Now it's probably too late to give coffee for the holidays.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   Although a new year's subscription to blue bottle might be a great way to start the year.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.360]   We just got a new one.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.360]   This is Ethiopia, Hambella, a state Buku.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.720]   And each one has a card.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.360]   This is the subscription, by the way.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   Twice a month.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.360]   You'll get an amazing fresh coffee.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.360]   You do want a twice a month.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   It's only 10 ounces, I think, or 12 ounces, twice a month.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.360]   That way you don't have, you don't want to buy it like all your coffee at the beginning
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.960]   of the month and have it be stale by the end.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.360]   This is, okay, I'll read to you the description on these cards.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   Story time.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   It's kind of like, remember the Peterman catalog on Seinfeld?
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   Ethiopia's coffee lands.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:35.960]   Hambella Estate supports its community of workers and their family with uncommon devotion.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:43.080]   In this specialty world, Hambella's exemplary washed and natural coffees have set new standards
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.360]   for the famed Gucci Zone.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.360]   Gucci.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.880]   The estate grows its own cherry, but it also outsources from surrounding neighborhoods.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:59.040]   The Buku is one such coffee, named for the farmers in the Buku neighborhood who contribute
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.480]   ruby red cherry.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.040]   Dry processing often makes for round syrupy and unctuous coffee.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.320]   This one, however, reveals such delicacy and clarity, both the senses and the mind.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.880]   Explain with delight.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.880]   Aha!
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.720]   This is the best one.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.080]   Okay, so that's the details.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.960]   Here's the digression.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:24.800]   If the coffee were a tone would, a kind of would carry sound waves well, then the indigenous
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:30.560]   Arabica trees of Buku would play wind-blown songs all year long.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.800]   Now, are you the person who writes?
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   I know!
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.400]   I get so much fun with this.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   I know!
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.320]   Blueberry, vanilla, and coriander seed.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.400]   But that's not the one we're drinking.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.280]   We're drinking, so I don't know what the notes are.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.120]   I lost the card for this one.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.880]   The Mexico Oaxaca, but it's good.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   Now, you're smart.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.880]   You're drinking it black.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.120]   Let's say the coffees of blue bottle are so rich and delicious.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.680]   Add a little cream.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   It's okay.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   It's okay.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   You don't drink with cream?
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.680]   I don't.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.680]   Mm-mm.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   Nope.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.680]   You know what?
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.680]   Straight.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.280]   When I drink my blue bottle, I'm going to admit a shameful thing.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   I put heavy cream in it.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   But you don't have to put sugar.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.680]   We put sugar on the cup that nasty bitter taste.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   You don't have to.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   You're right.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.680]   You don't get that.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.680]   Blue bottle.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   So here's the deal.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.680]   Bluebottlecoffee.com/twit.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.320]   $10 off your first coffee subscription order while you're there.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.480]   It's not too late to check out the digital holiday store.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.000]   Bluebottlecoffee makes a great gift.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Bluebottlecoffee.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   All year long.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Bluebottlecoffee.com/twit.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.480]   We thank Bluebottle for caffeinating our broadcasts all year long.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.720]   I just have one more.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.960]   They also recommend grinders on their website.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.880]   Don't grind with your blender as I did.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.880]   I had to.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.880]   Grind with your blender.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   Who would you love to do that?
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   I've never even heard of that.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.880]   I don't know.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.880]   You would do that.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   What?
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.160]   Well, but you know, if you buy a lot of cheap coffee grinders, that basically is what you're
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   doing.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.600]   They have the blades spin around just like a blender.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   That is not how you do it.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.800]   You need a burr grinder.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.720]   I think did you get a burr grinder?
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.360]   No.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   We have one here.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.360]   You can look at it.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.880]   Come bring your coffee and grind it.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   Okay.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   That's what I'd have done.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   We'll drink it the very next morning.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.680]   I just hit it with a robin of it.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.360]   We actually have a very fancy burr grinder here.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.880]   I have ground my beans here.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.280]   And then I thought it took too long and it was so I don't know.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.280]   I don't know.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:22.120]   I bet you the store grinders are a burr grinder, but then you can't get the blue bottle.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.280]   Are grinders okay?
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.720]   But you know, it really would be better if it had been echo enabled.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.320]   I bet you'll see that as he.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.320]   Let me try it.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.200]   Hey Google, grind my coffee, please.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   Sorry.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.720]   I can't help with that yet.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.040]   We're so not useful.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.840]   Google hasn't helped with anything today.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   Nothing.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   I have to say.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.680]   We have this is going to be a nice feature all year long in 2018.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.720]   You're going to get really sick of it, but we got the Google home max, the big nice speaker.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   It's nice.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720]   It's really good.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   And I love it.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   Google is in the room.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   Yeah, it tells us they can't do it in a wonderful.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:01.160]   And if you turn it upside down, it says, I just noticed I'm upside down.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.960]   You should turn me right back to the upside.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   It's really weird.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.920]   But anyway, I think it's going to be a regular feature on the show.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.640]   So we spent all of 2017 trying to get ourselves to not say the wake word.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.640]   Right.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   Now we're going to say it to wake it up.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.040]   My attitude towards a Hey, Siri, and Hey, Google is it should be okay for us to say
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.840]   that because you train it with your voice.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.600]   So it shouldn't my voice should not trigger your guy.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.640]   Now it's different for Echo.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.800]   Echo, you can train it, but most people don't.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   Sorry.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   I can't help with that yet.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   Thanks.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   But I'm always learning.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   You have a learn very much today.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   Exactly.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.400]   Well, I think we should do what your mom does, which is she calls it whoo hoo.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.400]   She goes, whoo hoo.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.000]   It doesn't work, but she no, but when she's on the show, she's on the show.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.400]   By the way, this was the year my mom made her debut on the Twit Network.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   Now she's a star.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.400]   Now she's a star.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   She's adorable.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   She'll be at this table next year.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:00.800]   I have never before seen uniformly positive comments on YouTube.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   Not one nasty comment.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   Oh, I should say I would actually say that.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   Yeah, I would actually say that.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.880]   It's like everybody was nice about it.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:16.200]   Anyway, this was also at the beginning of the year, you remember that President Trump,
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.120]   newly inaugurated, told the National Park Service to get off Twitter.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:26.600]   And that created as a result, alt-park service, and then a bunch of alt-Twitter accounts.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.240]   And they're everywhere, alt-everything.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.040]   In fact, this was the year Twitter became politicized.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.880]   President Trump tweets there, the resistance tweets there.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.080]   And this was, I think, very good for Twitter.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.960]   This made Twitter's year.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:48.520]   Well, it certainly raised the public knowledge that there is a company that exists called
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.920]   Twitter that you can communicate on.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.480]   Did it really materially change how the company was doing, though?
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:00.320]   You would think that in any other time, if the President of the United States of America
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:07.840]   is using a service or a thing so frequently and for so much important, important...
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.320]   Essentially, that's how he communicated.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   He even said that.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   That's how I communicated.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.000]   That's how he was able to bypass, let's say, the mainstream media to get the voice out
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.320]   to the people directly.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.440]   But even in all of that, you still kind of got the feeling that Twitter was missing out
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.680]   on an opportunity.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:28.120]   How do you turn that kind of attention, that kind of exposure, into, wow, Twitter's doing
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.440]   amazing now because the President of the United States is on board.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.440]   But that didn't happen.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.200]   That's always been the bane of Twitter, though, because yes, this got the more traffic, this
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.640]   got the more mind-share.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.560]   There's no one on the planet who any longer says, well, what's Twitter?
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.400]   However, Twitter's big problem has always been, how do we monetize that?
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.120]   We really have no idea how monetized that.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.400]   Well, and if you look at this, I have to say, if you look at the stock price, Twitter was
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.680]   in the basement at the beginning of the year.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.640]   Their stock price was $16.30.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.760]   They stayed low right through May, but started to improve, and a gradual uptick, and they're
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.080]   now $22.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:09.280]   So I think that you can say that in net, this was a good year for Twitter.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.680]   You know, a 40% overall gain stock price, at least it's one way.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.040]   Biz Stone also came back into the spring.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.840]   He said, one of the founders, I'm coming back to Twitter, it needs my help.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.560]   I don't know if you made any difference.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.280]   Because the end of the year did make rules that they have been gradually enforcing over
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.040]   the last few months.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.600]   Yeah, Twitter's almost been forced to address certain things that, you know, certain minor
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.640]   things, or I don't know if it's minor to say, you know, the jump from 140 characters to
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:44.600]   280 characters, but they were forced to look at a number of different elements of the service
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.800]   that I think up until then, it was easy for them to just bypass, not address it all.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:54.280]   And now, you know, they're doing things like, you know, cracking down on who they give the
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.760]   verified tag to.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:01.920]   Is that seen as a, some sort of an endorsement of that person, or is it merely just, you know,
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.120]   verifying that that person is who it is?
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.400]   Are they cracking down on the content, you know, the messages that are being delivered
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:14.480]   and where they've had a very firm first amendment, free speech stance on this in the past, they've
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.560]   been forced to make a lot of, do a lot of soul searching, I think.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.960]   It was also the month, January 2017 that Vine died.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.320]   But funny thing is that Twitter killed it and said, we're going to make a Twitter video.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:32.960]   All the benefit though, went to YouTube vine stars who took their act like Jake and his
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.920]   brother who took their act from Vine.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   Logan.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.560]   I don't, I don't like to think about that.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.960]   Jake and Logan, you know that.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.360]   Is that because your kids?
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.360]   Yes.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   They watch Jake and Logan.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.360]   Oh, a lot.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.880]   Because they're in the top 10, they make millions of years.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.280]   It's mostly just Logan for some reason.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.440]   Actually, one of my twins likes Jake, the other like Logan.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.720]   I think that's part of it is the rivalry and then the rivalry.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.720]   What are these guys?
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   I know.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   I know.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.200]   Anybody over 25 has no idea who any of these are.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.640]   There's a point of which you're 25 until you have teenage kids where you're totally out
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.880]   of the loop and then suddenly, you know, everything again.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.280]   But it's interesting that the vine stars instead of saying, oh, we're to stay on Twitter,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.480]   they were pissed and they, and they went to a, what is essentially a different medium
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.840]   because vine was what six seconds, how long was vine?
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.840]   I can't remember.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   Yeah, six seconds.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.880]   They went to YouTube and started doing longer form video, but they took their fan base to
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.000]   YouTube and that is a lesson that every-
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   A million subscribers.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   No, they're doing great.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.160]   They have a clothing line.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.720]   They have a house where in Brentwood.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.760]   Well, one of the, I think one of their houses might have burned down, but I don't know.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   That could have been, that could be taken.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.760]   They said mattress is so far.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.760]   They denoy the neighbors.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760]   It's a hysterical-
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   Oh, wait.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.560]   Are these the guys who they had noise complaints because they moved into a nice house and they
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.560]   moved trash?
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.560]   Like Beverly Hills or something.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.560]   I don't know.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.560]   Okay.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.560]   All right.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   Now I know them.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.560]   I mean, Twitter knew this was going to happen, right?
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.680]   I mean, when you shut our vine and you have a creator community, like those creators aren't
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   going to stop creating.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   They-
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.600]   They're certainly not going to continue creating for Twitter with their like vine camera
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.440]   app that everybody swiftly forgot about.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   That's what they were hoping it didn't work.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440]   No.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.440]   All right.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.320]   What is your favorite Twitter moment of 2017?
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.360]   You have one?
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.960]   My favorite is Sean Spicer tweeting his password.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   Not once, but twice.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.960]   Yeah, that was good.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   That was good.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.480]   The President's former press secretary who we don't know it was his password, but sure
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.560]   looked like it.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.960]   And you've done that, right?
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.440]   You've accidentally cut and paste and yeah, I think we've all been there at least once.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.680]   I've never done my password.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.680]   Maybe not on Twitter.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.680]   I didn't press send.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.240]   I know I've done it in the chat room once before.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   Go.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   I've done it in the chat room.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.800]   I can't like my memory because of Twitter is only about two weeks long.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.120]   But just recently dog rates Matt Nelson who runs dog rates the Twitter account with Q
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:53.080]   puppies that are rated he.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:38:00.040]   Ajipai followed him and he blocked him after he stopped neutrality, which was amazing.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.600]   Like and he like tweeted out the screenshot.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:08.200]   In a way, that's the power of social media is and it's a minor protest, but it's still,
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.880]   you know, it's a very public protest.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.800]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   Or that's enough.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.840]   So yeah, he just said no, no, you can pay for your cute dog pictures.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   Ajit.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.360]   Hi, no free cute dog pictures for you, chairman of the FCC.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.440]   Not if you're going to block net neutrality.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.240]   That of course is maybe the big story of 2018.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.880]   We'll see what those, you know, net neutrality, new net neutrality rules.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   Look at the follow button.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.880]   Leo.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   We rate dogs.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.920]   Dog underscore rates.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.560]   There's, there's too many Twitter moments for me to pick a favorite, but I will say
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.480]   that one of my favorite things throughout 2017 that involves Twitter is my own personal
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.680]   discovery and infatuation with the moments functionality.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   This was the year where I got, I understood why moments existed and now it's become a
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.520]   daily part of my ritual.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.240]   It's almost, it's almost part of how I first check in on, on what's happening, which is
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.840]   exactly why it exists.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.840]   I have yet to do that.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.440]   I mean, I remember when they announced it, that was more than a year ago.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.440]   I did.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.440]   I was more than a year ago, but this was the year that I got it.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   It's like, wait a minute.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.640]   No, I want to see the, the moments from the people I chose, not the moments from the things
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.760]   that you choose, but yeah, it's actually gotten quite good.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.760]   What do you, what tab?
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.880]   So I'm looking at today and it's kind of dopey.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.160]   Should you, should I do the news tab?
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.640]   I mean, you can.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.320]   And that's probably the one that I use the most in order to know, you know, because I'm
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.480]   just not, these days, like I don't know if I'm necessarily going to like political news
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.760]   sites as frequently as it was at least earlier in the year.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.800]   This is just a better way for me to jump in, get a quick, you know, take a quick glance
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.360]   at the current landscape of things, maybe read a few of these and jump out, move on
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.360]   with my life.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.240]   It is definitely a way to keep your finger on the pulse of the conversation.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.200]   I will say though, it's much more useful on a mobile device than in the browser, because
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.400]   in the browser, it feels more like a news website, but on the phone, it's much more
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   curated.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   It's like gender.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   So I don't like that.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.800]   I don't, oh, let's check this out.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   Clearly, the #MeToo hashtag was a big part of Twitter late in the year.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   Absolutely.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.120]   In fact, you know, Time Magazine picked the true, what they call the truth speakers, the truth
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.040]   tellers as their person of the year, and all year long.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.120]   And it started with Susan Fowler's memo.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.120]   What month was that?
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.120]   That was February.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   February.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:35.880]   And I just reread it, and it's amazing to read it now in light of what has happened
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.400]   since then, because I feel like there was, I mean, I remember reading it and thinking,
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:47.200]   gosh, this is amazing that she was able to say this, that she was brave enough to write
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.120]   all of these things about a company that she had worked for in an industry that she's,
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   I mean, she's very young, like that she hopes to stay.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:59.600]   And I was like, wow, this is really amazing and unique, and now it's so common.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:05.480]   And it was so risky, as you say, at the time, but it started the whole conversation at Topold,
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:12.440]   Travis Kalanek, the CEO of Uber was forced to resign, or at least step back and become
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.520]   a board member only.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:19.720]   And it did, I think, open the doors for others to come forward and talk about their experiences.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:27.200]   It eventually became an avalanche that took down CEOs, VCs, producers, people all over
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   in every industry.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   And when you read--
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   And it's not over, by the way.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   No.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   It seems to be escalate.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.760]   When you read this certain paragraphs of this where she, you know, she went to HR and said,
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.560]   here's this engineer that I'm working with who has sent me these text messages that are
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.240]   very inappropriate and applying that, like, he's in an open marriage and basically asking
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.760]   to have sex with her.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:52.440]   And so she went to HR, had screenshots of the text messages, and they said, I'm sorry,
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.680]   but here are your two choices.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:00.400]   You can either switch on teams and go somewhere else, or you can just stay there, and he's
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.360]   probably going to write you a bad review.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.200]   And, you know, that's-- that's the only two choices, which is amazing.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.080]   And basically, they were saying this engineer at Uber is so important that we are going
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.080]   to keep him.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.120]   And then when you compare him to, like, Harvey Weinstein or, you know, you know, keep naming
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.000]   him Garrison Keeler, like any of the people that you would think are very important.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.360]   Matt Lauer, like, now we have a zero tolerance policy for all of that stuff.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.520]   And that's just amazing to me.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.600]   And I do think that she opened the door to all of that.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:33.000]   I mean, of course, you know, Jody Cantor from the New York Times who did the Weinstein story,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.600]   she might have been influenced by that, you know?
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   Very much so.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.240]   I have to think, though, that a lot of this-- there's no-- it's no accident that it happened
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:47.920]   a month after Trump was elected, that a lot of this is stimulated by the fact that another
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.120]   person has been accused of this by 20 women is in the White House.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.800]   And we can't see-- people can't seem to do anything about that.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:03.640]   And so it almost feels like the frustration that women felt with that has now created
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   this movement.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   And who knows where this land?
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.840]   And I wouldn't be at all surprised if it didn't end at the White House, or at least
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.560]   get to the White House, maybe it won't ever end.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.400]   But I think men are listening.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.880]   And that's the really good news.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.520]   I think it's going to make a big difference.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.120]   There's an important corollary here.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:25.880]   If you wind back to the start of the year and even to the end of 2016, part of this
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   narrative, it's the anti-me too narrative, was, well, look at all these people who are
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.080]   having their lives ruined by these unjust accusations.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   Fake news!
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   That was actually the narrative.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   That's what people were saying.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.560]   Look, this new generation of leadership coming in, they're going to get rid of that.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.760]   And this was a pushback saying, no, no, no.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.520]   You get your facts right.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.320]   If anything, we're under-reporting.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.240]   If anything, people are getting away with things that normal, decent folks shouldn't
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.080]   be able to get away with.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:44:00.080]   So in a sense, this movement was the counter to that movement, which was a counter to a
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.080]   previous movement.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.680]   So you've got this pendulum swing back and forth.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:11.040]   It's just right now, people are so shocked that that pendulum had swung so, so far to
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.920]   the side of the perpetrators.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.320]   And now it's going to swing all the way back.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.000]   Well, and now you've got a lot of men.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.160]   Morgan Sproulach is one example of a man who-
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.160]   Who stepped forward himself?
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.160]   Or preempting.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.000]   I don't know if that's something that you applaud because it's still a lot of the things
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.040]   that he came out with are pretty, you know, not good, they're detestable.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:36.480]   But you've got a lot of the men now preempting this, this Me Too moment.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   Good, step forward.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.680]   I don't know if that's better than getting out.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.840]   I don't know, but I mean, I feel like it's at least a certain level of progress.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:48.640]   Because prior to that, and who knows their intention of coming out ahead of something?
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.120]   Is that to beat a story that might come out?
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.480]   And so it's still a very self-serving move?
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.600]   Or is it a true look inward to say, "Wow, you know, this has really opened my eyes and
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   I want to learn.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   I want to move forward."
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.360]   This hysterical article, I think was last week in Gizmodo.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.440]   The 2017 was the year of the bad apology.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.160]   And there were a lot of them.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.160]   There were a lot of them.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.840]   A lot of them came out of the Me Too movement.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.760]   People who didn't apologize, the non-apology apology.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.040]   They mentioned Robert Scobald's very bad blog post.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.280]   I would say he might have been one of the worst.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.280]   That was pretty bad.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.040]   Just because he was also marketing his company and the apology.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   That was the weirdest apology.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.840]   And I'm starting a new business in the blog post.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.760]   Mark Zuckerberg, remember he went to Puerto Rico and he had to apologize.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.160]   That's the best way to demonstrate VR.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.960]   For offending people.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.280]   He ended up saying, "But VR really is good for empathy."
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.960]   So that made it a bad...
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.240]   I think certainly when you take the apology and make it self-serving or promote self-promoting,
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.920]   that's not a good way to apologize.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.680]   I still don't understand how that actually happened.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:03.440]   Like how Mark Zuckerberg actually ended up in a virtualized environment over the top of
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.160]   this stuff because you have to imagine, I'm sure we could all agree, Facebook in terms
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.840]   of companies that have money to have smart people to think through these things and prevent
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.480]   bad PR situations must have seen something coming.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   I don't understand.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.080]   I was at OC4 and I could kind of see how it came about because the first step would have
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.360]   been what if we were able to show people what it actually looked like down there.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.520]   So we set up some 360 cams and people could actually put on their VR headsets and see,
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   that's a good idea.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.160]   That actually does promote empathy.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.160]   But then I'm sure they had someone in the marketing team saying, "Oh, by the way, at
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.720]   OC4, we're releasing this new feature that allows people to come in as avatars."
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.240]   And they said, "Okay, well, as long as we're going to be doing that first step, why not
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.480]   do the second step?"
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:51.280]   No one thought, "Wow, putting cartoon avatars over scenes of devastation, maybe not a good
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.280]   idea."
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   So it's an idea at first.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.280]   And then just evolved.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.360]   What did it evolve to?
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.880]   Or devolved to?
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.880]   Still in January.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.560]   No, I got some more January.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.960]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.480]   Because Chelsea Manning was sentenced was commuted.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.800]   The last, one of the last acts, President Obama, before he left office, commuted the
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.360]   sentence of Chelsea Manning.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.280]   And I think this was a little controversial.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:25.800]   People said, "But Chelsea Manning was a trader released information to WikiLeaks about US
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.720]   military operations.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.840]   She had served a significant amount of time.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.120]   The sentence was not overturned.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.560]   It was commuted.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.440]   Time served, in effect.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.440]   And let's see.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.600]   I think that, okay, now we can move on.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600]   To February.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.400]   Only 11 more months to go.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.600]   No, we'll move quickly.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.920]   We'll move more quickly.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.560]   February began the drumbeat of rumors about the next iPhone.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.400]   Ming Chi quote, "In February, and I want to give him credit," said Apple.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.200]   We'll make a glass iPhone with wireless charging.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.480]   We'll not include a wireless charger in the box.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.680]   All of that was true.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.960]   Then we saw a lot of rumors about wireless charging at a distance.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   Remember the company?
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.160]   I can't remember its name that said, "Oh no, you're going to be able to sit across the
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.360]   room and get phone charged wirelessly."
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.960]   I have to say, I want to take credit.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.320]   At the time I said, "Yes, that's not possible."
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.400]   And in fact, never did come out.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.400]   That's next year.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.480]   But we did have Scoble on the show.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.000]   And remember, he said, and made a bet with me that Apple would release a clear iPhone
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   at the end of the year.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.520]   You should ask him to write you an apology blog.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.040]   No, I don't know.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.920]   The only bet.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.120]   This is, again, an example of me not making bets.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:43.000]   Well, I said I'd take him to dinner at the restaurant of his choice.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   He chose Paris.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   I'm not a real fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   I'm not a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   I'm not a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   I'm not a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   I'm a fan of the restaurant.
