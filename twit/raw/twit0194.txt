[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It turns out that the Twits have an unusual reverence for

[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   from are with their mommies. And I think that's a wonderful
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   thing. But here's a bunch of guys who don't like their mothers.

[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Let's start by saying hello to Alex Lindsey, who is always
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   welcome on the show. Alex is one of the hosts of Mac Break
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Weekly. And he's of course the head of the Pixel Corps and
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   lives down the street. So we pretty much get him in here.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   >> Yeah, I just wondered. >> He's a freebie.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   >> Yeah, exactly. >> A freebie. Somebody else we just
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   wandered in. Brian Daniel Eisenberg, he's at
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   InfinitelyMeda.com. He was just in town from Seattle. You were
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   visiting a lot of different things, yeah?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   >> I started out at the Star Trek viewing that Ehrrington put
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   it on and then met with Scoble and then crashed Tech Crunch
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   headquarters, crashed Friend Feed headquarters, then had lunch
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   with Lewis. Well, Lewis is the one that took me down to both
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Tech Crunch and Friend Feed. And then gosh, then it was at
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Scott Beals event last night. >> Oh, you're doing the whole
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   scene. >> A very important product to try.

[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   things, Web 2.0. And yet, because we're about an hour north
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   by car, we get this great kind of removal too. And I don't mind
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   that so much. >> I love it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> Yeah, you live in Seattle, so you're also in an epicenter.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   >> Yeah. >> But there is a little--
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> You were saying it's a little more relaxed.

[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   >> Well, that's why it's not relaxed. There's money and, you
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   know, there's everybody's hoping to make everybody's hoping to score.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You know, this is where people are, you know, gunning to make money.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   >> Yeah. >> Also here, Louis Gray.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I don't know what Louis is doing here on Mother's Day.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   He's a proud Papa, brand new Papa.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   >> Well, the good news is the twins are asleep right now, so that
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   won't last forever. >> Yeah.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> I was told the audio is coming into you guys, but not over
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   the stream, so there might be some work to do there.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   My mother's doing great. My wife is also taking a nap.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   One of the advantages is you try and sleep when the kids sleep,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   and that's how we got time for you guys.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   >> I'm so glad you could be here.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Louis is a regular on Friend Feed as well as at
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   luisgray.com, a great blog site.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   In fact, you've become kind of almost an instant Friend Feed
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and Twitter celebrity because of your great blog posts, and--
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Twitter's been very, very good for it to you, hasn't it?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   >> I appreciate that. It's an interesting thing.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I'm one of the few people who was on Friend Feed well before
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Twitter. I was really kind of a lager on Twitter, because I
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   didn't want to get into that. But I recognize that you kind of
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   have to go where the people are. You can't be a holdout and say
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   one way is the right way. I got onto Friend Feed very early
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   on and saw the benefits that were there and continued to champion
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   the service. I don't think it's a situation of either or you
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   really can do both in tandem and they're a good compliment.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   >> Yeah, I would agree with you 100%.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I mean, I think that, you know, Friend Feed gets a lot of its
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   content, frankly, from Twitter.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So, Friend Feed, I don't know what Friend Feed without Twitter is.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   >> And now, Friend Feed is also a Twitter client.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> Yeah, that's how I use it. >> I don't post natively to Twitter
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   anymore. >> No, I post to Friend Feed and then it gets
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   blasted out to their end Facebook. >> Well, I try to reduce the
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   echo. >> I already broke the promise, because I said
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   this isn't, we're going to do any social media today.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> And we jump right into it. >> And then we jump right into it.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   >> It's all loose as well. >> Let's introduce one more person.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   One of the things I try to do with this week in tech is get an
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   international perspective. 30% of our audience is outside the US.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   US tech companies in particular, I think, while the companies
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   themselves understand that it's an international business, the
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   people in San Francisco, I bet it's true in San Francisco and
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Seattle too, are very provincial.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   You know, in San Francisco are nothing.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   But really, there's a vibrant, exciting internet community.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And joining us right now from San Paulo, Brazil, we have a web
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   designer who volunteered. This is the volunteer edition of
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Twit to be here. Carlos Gustavo Javiar.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Am I saying that right, Carlos? >> Javiar.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   >> Javiar. >> Javiar. >> From the land of Kinsasha.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   >> Kinsasha. >> Kinsasha. >> Kinsasha.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   >> Kinsasha. >> Hello there. >> Good to have you on
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Carlos. You know, one of the things that Brazil has become very
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   famous for is its embrace of open source software.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   >> Yes, of course. >> Well, so we have a drive in a
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   community here. >> Why do you think that is?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Is that an economic? >> Well, I believe it's got a
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   little bit to do with economics.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Of course Brazil started as a third world country.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   We are now in the status of developing country.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So we're off that. But like our government here, they use a
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   lot of Linux for computer programs for the community.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So I believe it's got a lot to do with economics.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   But people are also more open to new experiences.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   >> Speaking of new experiences, this is going to be the first
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Twit that we've also opened up to the general Twit community.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I said it was a volunteer edition. We're using talk
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   shoot today. I think it's something we're going to probably keep
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   doing. So I'm going to open up real quickly.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'm going to unmute all of you in talk shoot.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   We are in a room at talk shoot.com.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   This is room 499966. That's the room we'll always be in.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   If you search for Twit on talk shoot, you'll find us.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And you can go in there. You can be in the room and you can be on
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   the show. But let me just open it up.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Unmute and say hello to everybody who's listening on talk
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   shoot. Hello.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Who's playing music? Hello, everybody.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And somebody's at the piano. Whoever's on the piano,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   will you stop playing for a moment?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   >> Hello, Billy Joel.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   >> Billy Joel was here. Hello, everybody.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Adam, where are you from?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   >> Hello. I'm from Chicago, Illinois.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   >> Charbacks. Where are you calling from?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   >> Denmark.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   >> Denmark. Good to have you, Charbacks.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   It's a little, audio's not great, but we at least good to have
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   you online. Chunky, where are you from?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   >> That's on wheels and you tell you.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   >> Element one, where are you calling from?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   >> San Antonio Texas, there's like a hundred and seven degrees
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   of heat in deck.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   >> He's burning up in San Antonio.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Jeff Carter, where are you from?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   >> Where are you from?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   >> From the state, from the state, from the mental and mental
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   and mental and what teleports.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   >> From California. If somebody's got the audio piping back in,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   so if you could turn that off, I'd sure appreciate that.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   >> Sure appreciate that.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   >> You probably watching turn the audio.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   >> I'm going to have to mute.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   >> I'm going to have to mute it if you don't do it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   >> I'm going to do it.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   >> There you go.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Jonathan, where are you calling from?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   >> I'm from Carl's, from Caufford, from Caufford, from Caufford,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   from Caufford, from Caufford, from Caufford, from Caufford,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   from Caufford, from Caufford, from Caufford, from Caufford,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   from L.A., missing intellect.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I hope you're not completely missing.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Where are you from?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   >> It's just been a close, it's a little video game.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   But anyway, I'm from Los Angeles, California as well.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   >> I haven't heard that video game missing intellect.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It sounds like fun. New media designs.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Where are you calling from?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   >> P.H. Largo.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Where are you calling from?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   >> Oh, it's Fargo, and I'm from Seattle, Washington.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   >> Slargo, I'll say that right, Seattle.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Bruce Turner, where are you from?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   >> I'm in Melbourne, Florida.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   On the space coast where the shuttle's going off the wall.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   >> Oh, that's exciting. That's exciting.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I hear they have two shuttles on the pad because they want to have a rescue shuttle ready because this was the first shuttle flight where they couldn't shelter at the space station because they're in a different orbit this time.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   >> That's right.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   >> Very interesting.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It's a C2 shuttle on the pad, must be a sight.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   >> One of the last few times.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   >> Yeah, let's hope you don't see the second one launch.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   >> Second one launch.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   >> Thank you, Flargo.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Bruce Turner, where are you from?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   >> Yeah, that was me.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   >> Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   >> Sanka, where are you from?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   >> Star Trek, dude. Where are you from?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   >> Ohio.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   >> Ohio. No spoilers, okay?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Tech helper one.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Ryan, I know where you're from.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Where you from Ryan?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   >> Palm Springs.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   >> Palm Springs, California.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Rachel, where are you from?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   The one woman in this whole show with 800 guys.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Where are you from, Rachel?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   >> Western Wisconsin.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   >> You're a very brave woman.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Thank you for being here representing.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   >> All right, I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   All of you, so we don't have that massive sound.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And I'll take you all one at a time in the future.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   We'll go one at a time through you.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   So be ready.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I would encourage you, if you can, to have -- it would be great to have headsets turn
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   off any background audio.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   If you're listening on headsets, that'll be okay.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And then we'll call on you and you'll be able to come up.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I'm going to get Louis back.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   He dropped off.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And we can start talking about the news of the day.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And the big story, I think, is the Amazon announcing a new Kindle one month after
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   announcing the old Kindle.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I'm a little pissed.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Brian, are you pissed?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   >> I don't own one, so I don't really --
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   >> Louis, can you remember -- I can't remember.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   You're too young to remember anything, Louis.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   But can you remember ever a tech company announcing an update to a product a month
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   after announcing the first product?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   >> Well, Apple tends to do some updates similar to that, where they updated the
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   RAM on the iPhone and people get picked.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   >> Yeah, and people were pissed.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   But remember, that was -- first of all, that was a year later.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Second of all, Apple gave a $100 discount.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   >> Yeah, a year and one thing.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   >> This is two months later.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   >> Right.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   >> What's the deal?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   >> You must have had some kind of --
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   >> No, you can't complain too much.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I mean, it's one of those things where the early adopters don't always get the best deal.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   But they did have it first.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I'm not too concerned about it because I don't have a Kindle at all.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   You know, I'm an Apple fanboy.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   So if they have the iPhone version of it, it's good enough for me.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   >> Well, here's the theory and it's going around.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I don't know, Alex, you might want to comment on this because you're from Mac
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Break Weekly that maybe this is a preemptive strike.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   I mean, one of the things that's kind of interesting is they have announced it,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   but it's not going to be out till the summer, whatever.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   That could be August 31st.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   >> I do think there's some concern.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   >> Are they worried about the iPhone or the tablet?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   >> I think there's some concern that there is a -- from a media perspective,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   there's going to be kind of a black hole in this sector as we reach out.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   >> Oh, so that's it?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   >> No coverage after this.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   >> Yeah, because the problem is is that if Apple releases a media pad,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   like if they actually do something in June, they announce it.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   They probably won't ship it until the fall, but they'll announce, you know,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   a lot of people believe they're going to see some kind of large-drive phone.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You're not going to be able to get -- everyone's going to -- it's going to be --
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   everyone's going to compare whatever that item is for the next three months.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Anything that's related to the media pad, I think, is -- that's the challenge.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   >> I think it's incumbent at this point on Amazon to do something.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   A little love for those of us who bought -- I bought two Kindle Tues
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   because I got one for myself, and I got two days before the DX was announced for mom
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   for Mother's Day, a Kindle 2.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   >> Well, we knew that it was going to be released this week because you got the --
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   >> Ah, you know, it's -- >> Ah, that's the most cursed.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   >> Now, you do have 30 days to return it, so I could tell mom -- but I'm not going to tell mom,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   "Oh, return it.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   There's your Mother's Day gift.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   She's loving it.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   You'll get a bigger one sometime."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   >> Well, the question is -- I think a lot of people don't necessarily want a bigger one.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   It's not that much bigger.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Is it?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   >> It's 9.7 inches.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   >> Well, how much bigger is that?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It's like a --
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   >> No, I think it's like a 4-inch difference.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It's not that much bigger.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   >> It's not like you couldn't -- here's the thing that I think is way more important
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   than the size is the support for PDF.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   >> PDF.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   >> You know, because this is -- this is what -- this is how the iPod, I believe,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   squeeze the record companies into Apple's hand, which is that Apple gave them a legal outlet,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   but they also created something that anybody could use for anything.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And now the issue is, especially when you look at the textbook market,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   you know, what you're looking at as a bunch of students, you know, who are going to have --
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   some of whom have access to very high-speed scanners.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And what you're going to end up with, I think, is a pirated -- a pirated market
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   for a lot of the textbooks, if they don't react quickly.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   So what Amazon now has is it has that publishing industry between a rock and a hard place.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Without doing anything over, they're able to make it available.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   People can put up PDFs of anything as well as --
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   >> That's big.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   >> Yeah, and so the thing is -- >> Well, it's also the textbook in community
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   and the academic community.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I was talking to Kiwi Nerd in our chat at IRC.Twit.TV,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   and she said a lot of the documents that we get are in PDF form,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   a lot of the scientific papers and stuff.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   This is definitely aimed at the academic market.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   >> But if you're a publisher, you should be worried that the fact that the stuff is --
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   >> I would be worried about my intellectual properties just going out.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   >> DRMs are gone.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   >> Well, I don't know if DRM is gone, but I think the issue is --
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   >> I don't know if the Amazon can play. >> -- if they don't play with Amazon,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   if they don't produce something that is --
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   if they don't aggressively move their textbooks to an electronic format,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   think about bringing the price down to something reasonable.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   >> Well -- >> If they don't play that game,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   I think the issue they end up with is a lot of students circumventing them.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   >> It's the same thing that happened with the music industry and songs being distributed
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   through peer-to-peer networks, whereas they finally figured out a model for iTunes
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   and Amazon for distribution, and that's taking off in people I pay for.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   >> But they wouldn't have done it.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   They would not have done it if the piracy market wasn't so prevalent.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   >> Right.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   >> They would have never given it.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   >> And I think yours home market would have moved slower.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   >> This could be a whole new wave of piracy.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   >> When you have a closed system like the Kindle,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   you didn't need -- you know, it didn't put a lot of pressure on publishers.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And it's not just -- the other thing to remember is,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   it's just like movies.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   We saw the Wolverine come out.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Just like movies, every single book is in PDF format.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I mean, before it goes to the printer.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   So the thing -- you know, if you have a PDF available,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   the danger is that any of this stuff can slip out.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   >> Right. And it's such a widely-done format.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   >> Carlos, you're kind of left out on this because there is no iPhone for --
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I mean, no Kindle for outside the U.S., right?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   >> Yeah, there's no Kindle.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I get some friends that actually have it.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Of course, they brought it from abroad.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   They love it.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   But, you know, this PDF material is already out there, you know?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's not like --
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   >> Yeah, it's probably on -- it's probably on Pirate Bay, right?
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   >> Yeah, it's already out there.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   It's not because it now supports PDF that, you know,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   all this new Pirate Wave is going to come.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   It's already here, right?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   So I don't see it as doing more damage than we already have.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   >> Well, except that it's on the Kindle platform,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   which does damage just because if you like the Kindle platform.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   >> Well, I think just, you know, the netbook concept,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   you know, I'm not going to touch computing.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Like, I can't mouse with my right hand,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   because I've moused for 15 years, and I've destroyed my arm.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   >> Right.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   >> But I want to be able to touch, and it's the glass.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's the Corning patents that make the iPhone multi-touch possible.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   >> So Amazon couldn't do a multi-touch.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   >> Yeah, that's what I understand.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   >> So Apple has an exclusive agreement with Dow Corning
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   that's the most interesting thing is made out.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But Corning, I've been told, has come out with a new process
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   for a new glass that apparently makes this look like child's.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   >> Well, it's in Corning's interest to make sure that others can get it.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   >> And so you think about netbooks and the crunch pad
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and the thing that Scoville was talking about the other day,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   that he was some company in China.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Having, you know, computing devices that are made out of glass.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I want four walls, and I wanted them all glass.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I want some sort of projection system that I can compute.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   >> I don't think Amazon's going to bring you that.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   But however, the question is, does Apple have a built-in advantage
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   because it has multi-touch it as color?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Doesn't have the battery life.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   >> So I think that Amazon can't compete with.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   In other words, I would think Corning would get in bed with Amazon.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   >> I would think so.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   >> Amazon's growth.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   >> We don't know what the deal though with Apple is.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   I mean, maybe the Amazon is so closed with divulging anything
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   about what they do.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   >> I think that also though, I think that Amazon is really looking
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   at selling those razors.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   You know, they're not--
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   >> Oh yeah, it's absolutely--
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   >> But why don't you charge 360 bucks for the razor?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   >> Well, because I think that chunk of what we pay there is for the connection.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   >> They could take it out.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   They take 5% of each book.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   They could pay for it with the books.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I think Amazon-- here's my thesis on all this.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Amazon has never done a consumer electronics device.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   They haven't asked anybody.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   All you have to do is take a look at the Kindle One to realize
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   they're not the kind of company that's asking anybody for input.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   That thing was a joke.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And so they're just going along.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   They're bumbling along and they're making mistake after mistake,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   complete newbie mistake.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Mistake one, the stupid design on the Kindle One.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   They just made a mistake by releasing Kindle DX two months after Kindle Two.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   They seem to be missing the boat on the price.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I think Amazon just has their hand up their butt.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   >> Now that said, they're seeing huge growth points in certain age markets.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   >> We don't know.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Here's the other thing.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   What we don't know is how many they've sold.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   >> How many how many kindles they've sold?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I mean, we know they've sold kindles predominantly to people over 50,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   over 40.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   That's because my mom loves it because it got the big, big thought.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   But Amazon's not disclosing sales numbers.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   They're just saying we're selling out.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   >> Right.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   >> We don't know.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   >> You mentioned earlier that you were talking about the price and saying that it was too expensive.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It's actually gone up in price and not down with Kindle DX.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   >> How many bucks more?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   >> Look at Apple.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   You say people are worried about what Apple's going to do is this is a prim to strike.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   There's a prim to strike against a product that nobody knows actually exists.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   We've all been watching Mac for a long time.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   They've been talking about a tablet for a decade.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   >> Do we think Jeff might know something?
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   >> I think that everybody thinks they know something.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   My little sister who works at Apple Store Retail Trays gives me tips on when the MacBooks come out.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But if you take a look at Apple, when they first came out with the iPod,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   I thought it was undervalued in terms of, you know, it just didn't have a big enough heart as five gigs wasn't enough for me.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And it was too expensive.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   iPhone, people said it was too expensive.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And what did they do?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   They went out and just beat the industry into a pulp.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   So Amazon can look at them and say this is not too expensive.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Maybe they can show it as a premium product in a type of marketplace that doesn't have a lot of competition right now.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   They're not forced to bring the price down because they don't have a lot of competition in this space for what they do.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I think we're not even talking about the Sony's version, right?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   The Sony e-reader.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I know it's talking about that.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   >> No, in fact, I own both Sony e-readers, Lewis, and I'm a Kindle fan.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I abandoned it for the Kindle, and that's for one reason only, the wireless.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   >> Right.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   >> That's the killer app on this.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   >> Now, are you buying RSS feeds on that Kindle?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   >> No, you mean blogs and that kind of thing?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   >> I don't understand what that's all about.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   I do get salon, so I guess in a way that's kind.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I mean, I could read that on the web.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I also get the New Yorker, which is huge, but I don't find it a very good device, frankly, for scanning these things.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I wonder if the DX with a bigger form factor will be bigger.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   The time, supposedly, is going to do a deal that'll give you the Kindle DX if you can't get delivery to talk about a company mired in its old business model.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   >> If you can't get delivery, then you can get a DX.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   >> Well, I think that the issue, though, is that I do think that the advantage of the Kindle is, of course, that it will last a long time.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   It's probably easier on your eyes, but I think that also depends on whether you're planning to read an entire book or whether you're planning to read things in small pieces.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   I have to admit that I read, "It's great for a linear book, page after page,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   after page, after page, can be better."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   >> But if you look at reference, if you look at one, or if you want to add video or color or whatever, I think that anything that Apple produces is larger.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And to be honest with you, the iPhone, I routinely read large chunks of data from whether it's CNN.com or New York Times or other outlets on my iPhone, and I'm quite comfortable with it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   It took a little while.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I thought it was a little clusier when I started, but once you get used to it, and I think that a larger screen, I think would be much more compelling to me than a black and white low contrast screen.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   >> If you were talking about piracy earlier, Jason Kincaid at TechCrunch said that piracy was going to save the Amazon DX at the fact that you get PDF on there.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   It's a lot more advantageous to copy over a $70 textbook, and it was a $10 paperback.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And they're saying that the price differential for the actual media you're trying to get on it will push piracy.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   >> Well, and I think it will, and I agree with that.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And I think that the, I think also though, is it also makes the Kindle a more utilitarian piece of equipment.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   When you only could read what you could buy or download through the system, I think it was very limited the number of uses you could have for it.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   But now you can definitely imagine-- >> No, it's an Internet device.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   >> Or you can definitely imagine companies being able to distribute lots of PDFs to people for meetings or for information or morning or whatever.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   >> Right, executive research.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   >> A lot of that stuff was difficult when they were controlling that pipe, but being able to move anything over there provides a lot of other uses for this device.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   >> All right, I'm going to pick up-- this is going to be interesting.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I'm going to pick up one of our callers from the talk shoe.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   We've got a good bunch of people in our talk shoe chat room, and I'm going to pick up Rachel Z, who I mentioned to Z.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   The only woman in our talk shoe chat room.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So Rachel, that gives you pride of place.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Welcome to this week at Tech. Rachel, you have a Kindle?
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   >> I don't have a Kindle, but the thing I actually wanted to comment on is with being able to do textbooks in theory.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   >> And the future would be perfect because I'm actually dyslexic.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And so when I was going through school, I had to get tapes and listen to them and try to read along and stuff.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   But if they could somehow match up what you're reading in the textbook with the audio and not just the Kindle voice, that would be absolutely perfect for dyslexic people.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   >> You've got to figure that Amazon must be planning something like this.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   You know, they also own Audible.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   So wouldn't it be great if they tied the audio on Audible.com?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   >> Interesting.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   >> Really good because-- you know, my mom tried the automatic voice and she said, you know, by the way, it goes brag.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Alabama.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   But she-- she tried the automatic voice.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's too robotic for me.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   But what if you had Audible with a good quality reader reading the book, they own Audible, tied it into the text?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   >> You took my car.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   >> Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   >> You know, it would make a killer voice for books.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Apple with it's voiceover.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   >> With Alex.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   >> I think the Kindle voice-- you haven't probably heard it, Carlos, but I think the Kindle voice is very much like Alex.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I think it's probably the AT&T voice synthesizer, which I think is what Alex is based on.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   I mean you, Alex.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I mean Alex, on the--
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   >> No, actually, I think-- I often think that it's based on me.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   >> That's the way I view the world.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   >> So Rachel, would you buy a Kindle if they added that feature?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   >> Oh, yeah, hands down.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I'm already an Audible listener.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   So now I have my book and my iPod, and it'd just be great if they could just be together.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   >> Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Yes, if you're dyslexic, audiobooks, or a lifesaver.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   >> One of the other things is that I grew up with dyslexia myself.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And one of the big problems is a lot of times what my form of dyslexia was mostly color related.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   So if I had-- on a black and white, black on white is the hardest thing for me to read because I--
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   >> Rachel, you don't mind the black on gray of the Kindle?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   >> No, no, well, I actually would prefer-- I prefer actually light on black.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   >> White on black.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   >> Because-- or green on black is really what I can read.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   >> Green on black is-- >> You guys are old school.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You're the old school.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   >> But it actually-- >> It's literally just that I see the patterns.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   My brain will tend to pick up the patterns of the spaces between the words, which is what makes it difficult for me to read it.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And so I tend to avoid reading as much, you know, black on white.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   So-- but all of these readers allow you to start customizing.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   >> Deflating line.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   >> You get to start customizing how you view books rather than however they necessarily sign them up.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   >> Hey, Rachel, what are you reading these days unaudible?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   >> I just finished the audio version of Marlene Me.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   >> What did you think? That was that movie, of course, with Owen Wilson and-- what's your name from Friends?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   >> Jennifer Anderson.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   >> Jennifer Anderson, thanks you.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   I wasn't crazy about the movie, but it was a book pretty good?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   >> I loved it.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   >> I loved the movie and that's why I got the book and I listened to the book and I loved the book even more.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   >> You're a dog owner, aren't you?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   >> Not presently.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   >> No, interesting.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   >> No.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   >> Well, we're going to-- you know, guess what, Rachel?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   You're our first listener recommendation on our Audible.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   How about that?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   >> That's awesome.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   >> Marley and Me.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   How long have you been an Audible member, Rachel?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   >> Since January.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   >> And you love it?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   >> Yes, I do.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   >> I do too.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   I have to say.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Are you platinum or gold account?
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   >> Just gold.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   >> So one book of months?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   You mustn't have a long commute.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   >> No, I have about an eight minute commute.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   >> That's hard to get through a couple of books.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   I don't have a long commute anymore anyway, but I still have the platinum account.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   So here's your choice.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   You can have a gold account with one book a month or the platinum account.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Now, if you get the platinum account, folks, which is Audible.com/Twit2,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   you will get two books a month and two free books.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And the first one, Marley and Me.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   This is my recommendation.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Actually, this is Rachel's recommendation.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   She says, "Marley and Me, Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog" by John Grogan, which was better, the movie of the book.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   >> The book.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   >> Really?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   >> John Grogan, who wrote it, also reads, let's listen to a little bit of John Grogan.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   This is Marley and Me.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Any minute now, it will come up.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Audible.com/Twit2, you go there right now, you'll get two.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Count them two books.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I guess Josh is shy.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   John, I called him Josh Grogan.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   That's another person.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Yeah, we're not getting the audio, but that's all right.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Number one, New York Times bestseller, but here's a deal.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   A huge library of books awaits you.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Not just books, comedy, newspapers, podcasts.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   It's all available at audible.com.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   You see my book credits remaining zero.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   You can go through them all the time.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Audible.com/Twit2, you get two books free.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And Rachel, I thank you for being our very first listener recommendation on the show.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   >> Thanks for letting me.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   >> I appreciate it, Rachel.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Keep listening to it, Twit, and keep reading those audible books.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   We're glad to have you as a listener, and glad to get your feedback on the Kindle.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Let's move along to another story, another big story of the week, which was, I'm trying
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   to think, Star Trek.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   You know, I think this has to do with unmuting all on the...
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   All right, now, I should warn people.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   There's no way we can discuss this flick.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   No way we can discuss this flick without spoilers.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Are we in agreement here?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   >> You've seen it.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   You saw it, Alex?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   You saw it.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Well, you were sitting next to me.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Did you see it, Brian?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I have.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   You saw it, the tech crunch screening.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Lewis Gray, have you seen it?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I have not.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   No, Lewis is the anti-star Trek.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Okay, Lewis, you stick your fingers in your ears and go me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   for the next five minutes, okay?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Well, you don't know.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   I tend to see it anyway.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I know that.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   What?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   What?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   My entire family star Trek fans, which means I can't be.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   What?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Carlos, have you seen it?
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Oh, I haven't seen it.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   I just watched Wolverine.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.240]   Oh, you watch, is Star Trek in Brazil yet?
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.200]   Yes, it is.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.680]   It starts the same day that you guys did.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.000]   I think that the idea of rolling international releases is gone now.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   I think they have to because of the piracy really pushed that forward.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   You could see any movie that was released in the US, in Africa, I know, within days.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   In Italy.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   You know, through, you know, from --
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   It's alright.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   On DVD.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   On DVD.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Is there piracy problem in Brazil?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Pfft.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Well, we have a big piracy problem here.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.640]   It's all due to economics as well.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:34.600]   We have this little Chinese shops on each corner and they got all these cities.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.240]   They are running around from cops.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.000]   And yeah, we do have a --
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.400]   That's what gets me.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.320]   The movie industry in the United States criminalizes us.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.560]   You go to a movie, you pay $10.50 for a movie.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.720]   And the first thing you see is an ad saying stop stealing our movies.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.960]   And it's -- it's not me.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.120]   So it's Chinese guys in Brazil.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.320]   Go show them the ad.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.880]   I don't need to see that ad.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   And I think that one of the things --
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.080]   It's a Chinese guy's in Brazil.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.880]   I blame them.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.040]   Yeah, I remember my dad brought back a bunch of DVDs he got in China.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.360]   And it's like just random quality from the guy who's holding the video camera.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   Oh, it's a shaky camera.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.360]   It's handheld.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   And some of them are Oscar screeners.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   And some of them don't know what you're going to get.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.360]   You don't know what you're going to get.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360]   Shh.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   Well, alright.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.160]   So I'm going to chase everybody away.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.880]   So, Louis, you don't have to leave because you don't care.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.880]   How could you not care?
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   You don't like Star Trek?
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.600]   It's one of those generational things.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.800]   I don't know what the right answer is, Leo.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.040]   My little brothers and sisters love the fantasy, the Dragon Land series, the Star Trek, the
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   Star Wars, and it just never hit me.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   You're too old for it.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   I like sports and biographies.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   It was just different.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.800]   I don't know what we're going to do with you, Louis.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.360]   I don't know, Louis.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   I don't know.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.680]   I think I need the agenda to advance next time, Leo.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.680]   It's okay.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.680]   You're not going to go see it.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.280]   You're going to now spoil the movie.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.880]   So we're definitely going to have spoilers, huh?
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.720]   Are you going to cover your ears?
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.040]   No, we don't have to do spoilers.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   I don't know.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   Okay, what's a spoiler?
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   What's a spoiler, first of all?
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   They're a spoiler.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   They're spaceships.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.600]   They're spaceships.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.600]   You loved it, Alex.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.440]   You said it was the best one you've ever seen since Matrix.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440]   Well, I think it's the best.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.440]   I think it's one of the best sci-fi.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440]   It's such a matrix.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.440]   You know, I think that it was well done.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.040]   I think one of the things that made it 75 million dollar weekend.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.040]   It's a good weekend.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.120]   Now it's a 130 million dollar budget, so they still have a ways to go to pay it off.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   But they will.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.120]   They will.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.320]   Well, they've got, and here's the big difference is they've got great audience review.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.920]   They've got great critical review.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.600]   They've got all the things that are necessary to move to the 3rd one.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   Well, and they've got the hardcores.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   Right.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600]   I mean, the hardcore- The Trekkers love it.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   Trekkers love it.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.000]   I mean, I was walking last night to the robot games thing that Scott put on, and I was
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.160]   past the metron.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   Trekkies were out.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   A lot of guys were the ears.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   Trekkies were out.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.960]   We saw some guys with the Star Trek shirts.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.560]   And I think that the thing is, is that what was great though, is that while Trekkers were
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:54.240]   into the, to the process, I think one of the things that was important was that JJ Abrams
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.760]   didn't come from a Trekker background.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.440]   Didn't come from it being a fan.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.440]   He wasn't a hardcore.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   You know, he came from it.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.440]   I'm going to make a great movie.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.440]   I'm going to tell a great story.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   He didn't know anything about it, you said.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.440]   He wasn't.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.440]   Not very much.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.600]   Not, you know, in some of the interviews he just said, I'm not a big Star Trek fan.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.600]   I'm not a big Star Trek fan.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   Genius.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   He pulled that wide of a swab.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   You know what the genius is?
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.600]   Spoiler alert.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   This is the genius alert.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   He met.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.600]   He managed to reset the timeline.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.120]   So now he can do anything he wants.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   Right.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.120]   In other words, he's, he's.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.120]   I heard that.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.840]   I did say how, but he did something.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.720]   No, I actually, a friend told me before you.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:34.320]   But he's done something, I think very clever because he can start the franchise over without
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.000]   being too tied to the fact, you know, he doesn't have to get to a certain point somewhere
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   in the future.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.400]   He's going to have a creative, he can do whatever he needs because then that's.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.600]   Well, and imagine, I mean, one of the biggest problems with making a Star Trek movie is
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   the Trekkers.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.520]   I mean, they're both the blessing and the curse because, you know, if you say, oh,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.360]   I'm sorry, Mr. Spock, there's no way he could have known that the, you know, I mean,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.600]   then they, and, and so this way he could just say, well, it's an alternate timeline,
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   dude.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   Right.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   Sorry.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.040]   Well, I mean, unlike, you know, Star Wars, I mean, I grew up as a very young kid when
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.840]   I was, you know, Star Wars came at 79, 80.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.720]   I was like five years old.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:14.160]   And I remember seeing it and I, I, I didn't even see the last three that were made because
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.960]   I saw the first time, just completely lost interest.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.520]   But now I'm not a big Trekky guy.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.280]   I went and saw this movie and all the sudden it's evoking memories and like nightmares
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   that I had as a kid.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.880]   Well, and I think that also were, you know, they spent a lot more money on this star star.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.080]   You told me something interesting.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.720]   You said that JJ Abrams decided not to use models.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:40.480]   This was an, this was in post, in post magazine, there was an article about what they were
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   doing.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.200]   So it wasn't from any insider from issues.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.760]   I was reading the reading the article.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.800]   And what they were talking about was the fact that because of a lot of the dynamic moves,
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.560]   one of the issues you get into is when you really want to make a lot of dynamic moves,
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.400]   you know, you, you make camera moves.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.400]   Big camera moves.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.760]   It's easier to do that with CG than it is to do it necessarily with miniature.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.560]   Now the thing is, is that typically what happens when I work, for instance, on Star
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:08.040]   Wars, when we got really close to the ships, when we're flying right over the very top
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.120]   of them, we're using miniatures.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:14.240]   When we're a little further away, we're using 3D models because a lot of times it's very
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.840]   hard for a CG model to hold up when you get really close to it.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.240]   And I'm afraid that we saw a little bit of that.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.640]   You know, I wasn't, I wasn't sure because we were sitting in the fourth or fifth row.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   We were fairly close.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.920]   I was, I was, second row.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.560]   We were like IMAX close.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   Right.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.520]   And then because we're so close to the screen, we're seeing it, you know, maybe if you're
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.360]   a little farther back, but to me, it did not feel as real as a model, mind it.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.520]   And I will say that overall, I thought that the, the graphics were, you know, stellar,
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.440]   you know, a little too many lens flares for my, yeah, lens flares.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.120]   I actually had worn sunglasses.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   There were a lot of lens flares.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.160]   It's like the sun's constantly blinding you.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.200]   And so it definitely gave it a look.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   That's a style.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   It's a style.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   A style that Abrams went after the, the, uh, I think that when, as we got some of the very
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.960]   close shot of the ships, I didn't feel like, um, there was quite the same level of detail
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.600]   that we would get from a miniature.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.480]   Uh, but it gives you a lot more dexterity to do a lot of different things because you
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.400]   can re, you know, rebuild the moves.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.200]   The problem when you use a miniature is what you're doing.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   You shoot it and you got it.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.480]   Or you're doing a motion control camera.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.600]   So you're, you're basically you program the camera, you run it through the thing and it's,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.480]   it's a big deal to go back and do it again.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.400]   Whereas with, when you're doing CG, you just keep on tweaking it.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.680]   And so that, that gave them a lot more flexibility to just create much bigger, more dynamic moves
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.040]   on a lot of the ships.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.960]   So, um, you know, and as I said, I think that overall, um, you know, there were definitely
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.320]   places where if you know what noisy smoke looks, you know, what, what we tend to call
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.960]   Perlin noise, whether it's actually Perlin noise or not.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.120]   So when the, you know, there's certain parts where the ships going through stuff that,
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.600]   that you can, that some of that smoke is, is obviously CG from someone who makes CG stuff.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.600]   I don't know.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   Oh, you can recognize it.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   I didn't recognize that.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   I, I look at it and go, Oh, fake smoke.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   I saw fake smoke.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   Now, all right.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   Plot wise though.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.200]   It was a classic Star Trek plot.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.440]   It was, but I thought it was much tighter.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.120]   I thought that it was left.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   I thought it was.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.600]   I think if somebody's, I think if Lewis Grey goes to see this and he's not a Star Trek fan,
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.800]   he's going to say what was come on.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   Oh, please.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   Oh, no, what?
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.320]   He injected the red stuff.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   Oh, come on.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   Right.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.720]   Yeah, there were some stuff where you go.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.720]   Come on with the red.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.960]   Now don't know spoilers.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   No spoilers.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960]   You can't say.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.040]   There's stuff back from alias.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.240]   Was that from alias?
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   I think so.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   The TV show alias.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.800]   There's some, there's some red stuff in alias.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.280]   I don't think it's the same red stuff.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.480]   And alias kind of just ended.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   Like I never.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.640]   Oh, you think JJ actually is kind of tying his other stuff together?
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.360]   No, one thing I liked speaking of red, and this is not a spoiler.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   Who's breathing?
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   Carlos, are you breathing?
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   Who's breathing?
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.360]   Maybe that's a, maybe that's Lewis.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.360]   Not, but not in the mind.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   You're not allowed to breathe.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.000]   Whoever's on this, I think it's you, Lewis.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.440]   Move that microphone a little away from your, there you go.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.400]   He's all head up because of this Star Trek stuff.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.400]   The Star Trek stuff.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   He's watching a lot of this.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.400]   I'm not here anymore at the Star Trek stuff.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   I can't talk about it.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   We're almost due.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   We'll talk about friend feeding a little bit.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.480]   I'm trying to get away from the social media.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.400]   Now I'm now while we're doing the Star Trek stuff.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   I can't wait.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   There you go.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.320]   But one of the thing I thought, first of all, maybe because JJ wasn't a Star Trek fan,
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.400]   and he had, I think he had a book saying you got to say this, this, this, this, and this.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.400]   He hit every post.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.400]   But I thought it was done well.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.120]   I thought when it inserted it, it was just inserted well enough that you really, it really
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   ties it all together.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   Oh no.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.500]   And you can hear the gasps in the audience when Scottie says, "Kotten, I'm giving it
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   all she got."
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.200]   And everybody goes, "Yeah!"
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.840]   And, but did you notice?
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   Red shirt guy.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.080]   They even had a red shirt guy.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   And not only that, they had a cocky red shirt guy.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   Did I not lean in?
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.600]   Did I not lean in and say red shirt guy?
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.440]   The only thing Leo says during the movie is, is, you know, because he's required the whole
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.200]   movie, but there's one part where this cocky guy and a red shirt and Leo leans over,
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   and he's like, "Red shirt guy."
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   Red shirt guy.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.560]   I was so pleased that he did that because that was really...
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:05.120]   For me, the single thing was, was what came out and...
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.600]   Well, I can't...
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.600]   Don't spoil it.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.840]   We haven't spoiled it yet.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.440]   It was something that was in, I think, Star Trek II or III.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.960]   It caused me a great deal of nightmares and that kind of stuff.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.640]   Oh, I have to think about that now.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.280]   And somebody saying in the talk shoe that he wasn't crazy about, they felt like it was
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.000]   a little forced when Bones says, "Damn it, Jim.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.720]   I'm a doctor, not a physicist."
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   Or Spock at the time.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.480]   That was even a little force.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.960]   That was a little force.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:41.000]   And I think the guy playing Bones was almost doing an impression of Bones.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.400]   Simon Pegg was so good at Scotty.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.960]   No, this was definitive Scotty.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.240]   I'm sorry, James, I'm doing, but this was the definitive Scotty.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.520]   He was a fantastic Scotty.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.520]   Well, exactly.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.560]   And I thought the portrayal of Spock was good and Kurt.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.200]   Check off, Zack-Sachson.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   Check off Zack-Sachson.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.720]   I don't know what to say about it.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   Just check off Zack-Sachson.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:12.120]   He reminds me of the Russian guy in that stupid Bruce Willis movie, Armageddon.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   Or one of those crazy...
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   It's a little over the top.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   It's a little over the top.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   Up on the space station.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.120]   It's a little over the top.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.200]   I think they were having fun with it.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   I don't think...
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.680]   Well, they clearly were because there's a comedic scene.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.600]   So I think that was purposely a little over the top.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.440]   Scott TD is in our talk shoot chat.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.000]   Scott says he went to the movie and he went in costume.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Whoo!
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.840]   Scott, what was your costume?
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.880]   Well, I'm actually studying engineering.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:44.800]   My name is Scott, so I went as Scotty in the Rapopron era uniform.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   Oh, that's pretty awesome.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.880]   Did you have that or did you actually make that?
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.920]   We made me and two friends of mine, all in engineering, made them...
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.920]   Oh, that's so great.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.160]   Last year for Halloween because we realized the movie was coming out.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.080]   So ordered the parts.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.920]   My mom helped us assemble them because she's the master's interest.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   So it was really awesome.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.520]   People were taking our pictures.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.680]   And say hi to your mom because it's Mother's Day.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.440]   Oh, it already did.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   Good.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   Good.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.440]   She doesn't listen to Twitt probably.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:21.880]   No, my dad does though, so he's going to be confused when he listens to this.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   And what did you think?
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.120]   Give us your review of the movie.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.000]   Were you satisfied?
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.880]   I was completely satisfied.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.040]   I don't think the movie could have gotten any better.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.280]   It could have been a lot worse because it could have been wrecked.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.120]   It could have been a nightmare, absolutely.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.120]   It was changing.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   It was changing.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   It would have come up.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.720]   It's sort of the fact that he wasn't married to Star Trek, like he wasn't a big fan before.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.360]   He could just make it up whatever he wanted to and then bring in the allusions to the
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   old thing.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   The thing about Admiral Archer and his dog, which I even missed while watching it and
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:03.640]   all these other little cute things, he could bring in, of course, to having to write the
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.320]   story with needing those things to be there.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:12.160]   So I think that's how it really succeeds.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:20.040]   And I remember when the first Star Trek movie came out, there was this frison when Kirk
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   and Spock appear on deck that you're seeing them again.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.120]   And there was this kind of wonderful sensation of, wow, they're back.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   And I'll never forget that.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.720]   I mean, I got Chills seeing that first movie.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.160]   And he was able to do a little bit of that.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.280]   Seeing them young, the first time the kid says, James Tiberius Kirk, there's just this
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.120]   little frison of, wow, we're back, baby.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.320]   And we're back and we can do whatever we want.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.880]   He reset this movie.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.960]   They've got now, they've got all the worm in the world to play.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.680]   I mean, I was thoroughly entertained by that movie from start to finish.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.040]   What was your favorite scene, Scott?
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.840]   You got to pick one.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.400]   No spoilers, but just.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.920]   Well, that's the hard part.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:06.520]   I actually, I'd have to say, like talking about the models and how it looked, I didn't,
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.360]   I was pretty close up and I didn't notice anything like from the model.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.520]   Alex is different.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.000]   You know, Alex has an eye, he's looking with the professional's eye.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   So he's going to see stuff.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.040]   And I think it was fantastic.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.880]   I don't want to say that it wasn't, it just, I felt like a physical model might have felt
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.760]   a little bit more real than the.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.120]   You don't get those great hero shots.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.120]   Well, they did a hero shot of Enterprise, for instance.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.280]   Oh, you're seeing in all the windows and stuff.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:40.400]   It didn't feel to me like those classic hero shots of earlier movies where every detail
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.400]   is there.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.080]   You're really looking at something real.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.280]   It felt a little.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.560]   Now, I'm not sure because I was so close, but it just felt a little soft.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.000]   It didn't feel quite as realistic as a model.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.040]   The level of detail and what I'm thinking is like the scenes from Star Wars, or like
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.840]   the Emperor's looking out at space and the death star and that kind of thing where that
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   it's like, wow.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.640]   Well, especially you notice it when they're really, really like inside the ship, like going
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:09.880]   between support panels and stuff where the ship is just full frame.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.240]   That's where I felt like it wasn't, I said it wasn't completely home.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.720]   See, that didn't bother me as much because I was admiring the fact that they made the
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.720]   ship real.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.000]   It's the first time you see pipes in the Enterprise.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.200]   You see ducting.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.080]   You see stuff happening and it really looked like you were geeky stuff, like you were
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.440]   in the bowels of an actual ship.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.760]   And we've never seen that before.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.680]   I mean, that normally the Enterprise is sleek and clean and there's no, you know, maybe
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.080]   Scotty's climbing inside the core, but it's all beautifully lit.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.920]   And this looked like it was a working ship.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   I liked it.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.360]   There were pipes in the original series because they were all labeled G and D and which is
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   goes nowhere, does not.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.440]   Well, Scott, you are a trekker.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   Now I know.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.440]   Hey, Scott.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.800]   Yeah, really goes nowhere, does nothing.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.800]   That's awesome.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.360]   That's hysterical.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.360]   That's wonderful.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.360]   Hey, Scott.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   Thank you for being on the show.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.360]   Yes, no problem.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.360]   Keep that engineering outfit.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.360]   You might need it.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.840]   We might star fleet might be calling you up.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.000]   I thought it was a really, I thought it was the casting was very interesting all the way
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   across.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Excellent casting.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   I thought it was a really good casting.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Excellent casting.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   I thought that Winona Ryder did well.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   I didn't know it was her until I saw it.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Yeah, neither.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.440]   Now, she was aged, right?
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.440]   I think she was.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.920]   I don't think Winona has those kinds of bags under her eyes.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.160]   And you noticed in the credits, there was a company that does go back and forth.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.040]   Yeah, typically they're known for making people look younger than they are.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.760]   But that's the same as making somebody look older, right?
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.280]   Well, it's in some way.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.080]   So Lola affects that's their specialty.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.080]   So in the credits there, they were there and there's special.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.480]   We should say Winona Ryder is Spock's mom if you want to watch for her.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.480]   Right.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.840]   But you never, I don't think you'd notice it unless you knew it was her.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.840]   You noticed it, Alex.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.440]   I was shocked when I saw her in the credits.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.800]   I don't recognize, but I was like, well, I said, who is that?
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   She's beautiful.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   She's somebody.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   I don't know who she is.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   Right.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   Right.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.520]   And, but I mean, of course under her robe, she had stolen three, three faux necklaces
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.280]   and a pair of gloves from the extra years.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.280]   Wow.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   And I think that's a big thing that up.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.280]   That's been eaten.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.280]   That's another kind of bag, right?
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   That's a no.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:12.120]   But even even guys like, I mean, I thought that, you know, Ben Cross who played the Spock's
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.960]   father, you know, as an actor that you see in lots of little places and you just wouldn't
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.240]   expect to put him in as a.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   He was great.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.000]   And he was, you know, he had that bone structure that he made him look like a Vulcan.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.840]   I mean, there's something about his mouth and his bones.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.520]   He just didn't look quite human.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.720]   And I thought that was really nicely done.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.600]   I don't know if that was makeup or if he really looks, does he look like that?
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.960]   Because the center of his face looks largely the same.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.840]   But the, you know, obviously some of the other, they were doing something to him.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.280]   But yeah, it's so anyway, but a lot of an Eric Vanna as you wouldn't think of Eric
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.280]   Vanna as Nero.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.760]   No, he was a fan.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   He was.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   He did.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   Oh boy.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   He did really well.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.360]   The Romulans in this movie are he full baby.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   They are bad.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.280]   But here's the thing is that they're bad.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.280]   Hushio Mal.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   I'm talking about Romulans.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:03.880]   I think that one of the things about the Romulans though is that he made, he did not, you know,
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:09.680]   I guess the wrong word to say humanize, but he did make it his, his beef real.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:14.040]   You know, rather than a lot of Star Trek, you get these kind of crazy, you know, we're
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040]   angry.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.240]   We're going to do whatever and it's you almost want to feel sorry for.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.040]   Well, he created, he created a reason for them really to be angry.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.680]   What I think is more story development than we see often times.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.520]   That's because he's an actor.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.400]   Well, but I mean, in this part of the story script, I agree.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.400]   I'm just teasing it.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   All right.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   We're going to come back with a story.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.440]   Give, give a guess before we go to the break.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.440]   Give a guess.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.680]   How many homes in the United States do not have landlines, but just what percentage of
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.920]   homes do not have landlines, but just have cell phones?
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   Don't tell me Alex Lindsey.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   We're going to hold on.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.240]   We're going to come back and just a bit Carlos.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.520]   You could play this game too, even though you're in Brazil and I'd like to know what
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:50.440]   the percentages in Brazil, Lewis Gray.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.720]   Thank you for listening through this entire boring star Trek episode.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   You couldn't hear Alex.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.960]   He's been on "Friend Feed" the whole time.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   He's been on "Friend Feed"?
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.720]   Have you been posted on "Friend Feed"?
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.720]   He's not saying.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.200]   Well, you've got a live chat there, so you might as well participate.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   It's true.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.120]   We have four out of 12 comments already and we're just a crowd of the way through.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.080]   No, not watching that comment stream is immediately.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.640]   We should tell people that I have lately on Twitch been starting.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.800]   We have a Twitch room, a Twitch conversation, and we actually have a number of Twitch rooms
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.520]   on "Friend Feed", which I created a long time ago.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.240]   But there's one Twitch dash conversations where every time we start a new show, I'll
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.320]   start a conversation.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:31.160]   So if you're on "Friend Feed", you can follow that and participate.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.800]   And we watch it and it goes quite...
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.520]   It's really kind of a static persistent chat room.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.520]   It's an interesting...
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.520]   Static IRC channel.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.040]   I actually want to ask you, Lewis, what do you think now that "Friend Feeds" beta is
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   at?
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.360]   We'll talk about this also in a little bit what you think of what they've done with the
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.360]   website.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   Yeah, you're social media.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   Oh, stop it.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   By the way, Brian is on Twitter as InfinitelyMetta.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   Of course he is.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.200]   Meanwhile, I'd like to talk about Squarespace.com.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   Show of hands.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   Anybody here using Squarespace?
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   Squarespace anybody?
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   We are going...
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.880]   Leo's just throwing me a softball here.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.240]   We're going crazy with Squarespace.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.200]   So what do you mean?
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   What do you mean?
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   We...
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   Pixelcore?
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   Pixelcore.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.760]   We started off moving "Twip" log.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   So "Twip" this weekend.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   This weekend.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   This is a talker thing.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:23.640]   And so we put up our online presence there as "Twip log.com."
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:28.160]   And it was so easy to adjust.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.800]   Aaron, Mayler, and I, what was great is we'd sit there on Skype.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.120]   And the two of us had a two-hour session and designed almost the whole thing.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.120]   And I could move stuff around.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.280]   Aaron could move stuff around.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   We could move...
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.960]   You mean in design terms, it's really cool that way.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.560]   You can drag and drop the call.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:47.720]   You decide how the width of the main content area you can drag and drop everything.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.720]   That you need to do.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.520]   And here's the thing that's important.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.520]   Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, you said you used Squarespace before we did?
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   Yes.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   Alright.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   She's got an indignation.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.200]   Rachel, you're going to...
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.760]   I'm going to see if we get the hat trick for you.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.560]   I'll get you in every commercial.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.640]   So Rachel now is an audible and a Squarespace user.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.200]   You have about 15 minutes to try our third sponsor.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.640]   I'm not going to tell you who it is, Rachel.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.560]   But I think that the thing that we're really excited about related to Squarespace is the
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:24.320]   idea that the people who are managing our content are not having to email somebody to
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.880]   ask them to make a change in the website.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:31.800]   And so the thing is when someone who's managing a certain area of our websites needs to make
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.760]   a change and there's a structural change that needs to be made, they can make it on their
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   own.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.240]   Now we still are going to need to do some custom code to get some of the stuff done that
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.800]   we want to do.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.600]   But you can do that because it takes JavaScript.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   It'll take JavaScript.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:43.600]   You can do it.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   Exactly.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.200]   So you're limited to whatever Squarespace gives you.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.920]   You can inject code into the system.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:56.080]   But you can build the entire skeleton of what you're doing on something that is very malleable,
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.240]   very changeable.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.280]   If you decide somewhere down the road you don't like Squarespace, one of the things
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.520]   that made us feel safe was that we get exported out to.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.520]   I love it.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.800]   Import from Blogger Moveable Type Type Ad WordPress Export To.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.520]   Rachel, what's your site?
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.200]   You want to give it out on the air?
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.200]   Oh sure.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.760]   It's girlsnightinradio.com.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.720]   It goes along with one of my podcasts.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.720]   Oh, so you're a podcaster.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.880]   Yeah, I have Squarespace.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.640]   And one of them is called Girls Night In.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.640]   You know, WordPress.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   Girls Night In Radio.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   Okay.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   And what's the other podcast?
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   Sims Two Challenges.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.280]   Jim's Two Challenges.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.280]   Yep.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.280]   Sims.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.280]   Sims Two Challenges.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.520]   Oh, so you challenge people to do stuff in Sims?
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.280]   Yeah, people write different challenges than I review them.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.000]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Look at this.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   This is beautiful.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Nice.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   How hard was it to get that design in there?
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   Not too hard.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.880]   I think it took me probably about four hours to get the whole site up and running.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.720]   And I notice it as a podcast player.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.560]   That's handy.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.920]   So people can go there and listen to your show.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   Yep.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.200]   Very cool.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:06.160]   Girlsnightinradio.squarespace.com.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.600]   So there's a unsolicited, until I put her on the air, I guess, I kind of solicited
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   it at that point.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.120]   Unsolicited testimonial for Squarespace.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   It's more than a blog.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.600]   It's more than a podcasting medium.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.000]   You can do forums, photo galleries.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.840]   It's really your next web host as well as your next content management system.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.000]   Complete permissions for multiple editors.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.680]   That's kind of how you use it, Alex.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.200]   Cloud architecture gives it speed and site stability.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.560]   I mean, you get dug.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.920]   Don't worry about it.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.440]   Kevin Rose uses it.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.520]   I guess that's a indignation, apparently.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.400]   Squarespace.com/twit, free to try.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.680]   No credit card needed.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:53.040]   If you use Twit as the coupon code, when you sign up, you're going to get 10% off.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.080]   You could say "dignation," but use "twit," okay?
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:01.120]   And I want you to sign up again, Rachel, with my coupon code, okay?
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   No.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.800]   You don't have to.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:08.680]   But I bet you a "dignation" never gave you a plug for your blog and your podcast.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.160]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.160]   We salute them.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.160]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.160]   Okay, soon.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.160]   Squarespace.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.160]   iPhone.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.160]   Ooh, now that's interesting.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.160]   I didn't know that.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.160]   iPhone app.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.160]   And like social, I mean, Flickr.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.160]   Yeah, no, you know.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.160]   You have my intention.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.920]   It's these guys, Dane and Anthony, who's the programmer, are brilliant guys.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.920]   They're really sharp.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:31.680]   Well, and like with other blog sites, I'm starting to play with putting stuff out through
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.280]   Mars at it, putting stuff out through a high blogger on my iPhone.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   Oh, sure.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.440]   And all of that's just you log in, boom, you're just able to upload.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.240]   What framework are they built on?
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.240]   They're their own.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.240]   Is it Java?
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   Is it C?
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   It's Java.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.240]   It's all Java.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.240]   They did themselves.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   These guys are very talented Java programmers.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.680]   Well, that's what I've been doing for 10 years.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.160]   You know a little bit about that, so you can...
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.160]   I'm not a programmer, but I'm doing that.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.840]   I know enough to be dangerous.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.920]   They're using, I wish I could remember, because he told me that the virtualization is done
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.200]   through Java as well.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.920]   So it's very easy for them to add more capacity.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   It's really cool.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   Very interesting.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   All right.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.640]   So in the CDC, apparently the Center for Disease Control keeps track of landlines.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:15.520]   And actually I was told in our chat room by a nurse, the reason they do is a lot of health
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.560]   monitors use phone lines.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.040]   So something the CDC has to keep track of.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.680]   They have put out some new results, huge growth in the number of people not using landlines,
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.720]   using cell phones only.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.160]   What was your guess, Alex Lindsey, for the percentage of households that have cells only
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.160]   in the United States?
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.120]   My guess is that it is a third.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.120]   33%.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.440]   What do you think, Daniel?
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.240]   I mean, Brian.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.240]   Brian, Daniel.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.120]   You think a third is too high, too low?
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.680]   I think it's right about right.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.840]   Carlos, what would it be in Brazil?
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.280]   It's probably very high in Brazil, right?
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.480]   I would think more, yeah.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.040]   In Brazil, it's still very high cell phone, mobile market.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.160]   It's a big thing here.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.360]   But a lot of people still have the landlines.
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:09.280]   A lot of them also get the usual land number with their cell phones.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   It comes with it.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.320]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.120]   Hey, Lewis, what about you?
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.440]   Do you still have a landline?
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.400]   You're a young hip kind of dude.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   My wife has a landline.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.600]   I'll put it that way.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.520]   24% would be my guess.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.880]   You guys kind of ruined the story because it's 20%.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   20%.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.480]   I thought that was a lot.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:36.200]   It's one in five people in the US, an increase of 3% points over the first half of the year,
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:41.320]   the largest six month increase since the government started collecting such data.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.040]   Now here's the other side of it.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.160]   17% don't have cell phones.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.560]   70% are landlines only.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:51.720]   Well, we haven't had a landline for 10 years.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.720]   I haven't had a landline.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.720]   You're one of those people.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:56:01.400]   Well, part of it was I was moving a lot for a little bit in the early part of this decade.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.000]   But then I just couldn't.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.480]   I didn't want to deal with people calling me.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.920]   I didn't want to deal with all the other pieces.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.760]   And I just wanted one number of people get a hold of.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   I don't want to say this is my online.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   I'm going to say this is my online.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.760]   This is my cell phone.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.440]   You actually are probably correct because in addition, there's a 15% of the households
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.200]   have landlines, but don't use them.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.440]   They're there for emergency.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.240]   I have Comcast as my provider for cable, internet and VoIP.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   Right.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   So I have a Comcast line.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.080]   I run my own apartment.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.240]   So that's my business line.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.640]   I don't answer that phone ever.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   You never use it.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.320]   I have a voice in when I have apartments for rent.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.840]   I put the ad up there.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.840]   And that's it.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.120]   So you're in a large group of people.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.120]   Same thing.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.040]   Carlos, you have a landline, but you don't use it.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.520]   I use it for your fucking internet, phone and TV.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.720]   It's a whole package.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.120]   I don't use the landline.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.360]   It's just for emergencies and maybe my dad calling me from Brasilia.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   That's it.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.960]   The crazy thing is is that if I make a phone call from home and I'm not using my cell phone,
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.120]   I'm calling out of Skype.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   I'm not.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   I don't think so.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.120]   Yeah, me too.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.600]   I rarely use my cell phone anymore.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.040]   I use Skype all the time.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:12.640]   So the only thing I use my landline for on day to day basis is conference calls where
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.880]   I'm dialing at 800.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.880]   Right.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:15.880]   Because we have bridges.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.880]   Everybody in our company has.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:21.280]   So I think Alex, you really get, you win this because about a third of people in the
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.000]   US don't use a landline.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.880]   They use their cell phone in lieu of landline.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.320]   Some of them still have a landline, but it's vestigial.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   Right.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.880]   So we have people 18 to 24, about a third of people only have cell phones.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.960]   They don't have landlines in the house.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.200]   So you're right there too.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:40.800]   So it's really the older folks who are putting the landlines, giving the landlines some creams.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.200]   But well, that's a big shift.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:45.600]   But I think as you start to, when you start having people who are moving around a lot
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.840]   and are used to why you want a single line, you don't want to tell people.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.840]   Single numbers.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.840]   Single numbers.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.840]   My cell number.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:52.840]   This is my, and this gets back into my Google voice.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:53.840]   Well, that's where Google voice.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.320]   That's exactly where I was going because Daniel just turned, I've had a great essential account
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.640]   and I, oh, you never up.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.400]   I've never, never used it.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.400]   Oh, no, no.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:06.680]   No, when I called Daniel, I was like, wow, I have five cell phones like, you know, I
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.680]   need it.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.720]   And it sounds like it's the first, the very good service.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.880]   The first big thing for me was moving to where my business card now has my Google voice
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.880]   number.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:20.040]   And that was a, that was a big shift over where I just, I'm ready to commit to just giving
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   someone one number.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.280]   Now I route some people to my office, some people to my cell phone, some people, you
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.080]   know, and I can, I can set all that up for my.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.640]   You have control over that.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.480]   Absolutely.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.560]   I mean, I, I carry three cell phones around.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   It's ridiculous.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:37.240]   I mean, let me ask in the chat room, a talk shoot chat room.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:43.040]   If somebody wants to talk about Google voice, who's in there that would like to talk about
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.640]   Google voice?
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   Looks like a lot of people.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.760]   Jeff Carter says he's using it for your students.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.760]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.760]   Welcome to this week in tech.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.760]   Hi, Leo.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.760]   How's it going?
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   It's good.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.240]   So you're a teacher or a professor?
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.240]   I am.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.240]   I'm a professor.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.920]   I teach science, biology, neuroscience, that kind of thing.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.920]   And where?
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:07.080]   I do this here in beautiful Loma Linda, California.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.240]   Awesome.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:12.960]   So you have a landline and you have a cell phone, but you use your Google voice line
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.960]   how?
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   I do.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.080]   I tell you, I've got, I've got at least three different phone numbers.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:24.000]   Google voice, what it does, what's so great about it is it allows me to give my students
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.120]   one number, right?
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:31.680]   And it's a number that's not necessarily associated with my personal information.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:35.480]   That being said, what's great about it is when they call me up with an excuse about
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:42.000]   why they can't quite make it to class that day, it rings up on all of my lines.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   Right.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.120]   And so it's pretty handy.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   And you know what I love?
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.440]   Now I don't know if you use this.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.880]   I have a text message me with the text of the call.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:54.880]   Now the text is, the voice recognition is not great.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.040]   But I can usually kind of figure out what's going on based on the context.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.520]   It gives me enough.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.360]   Do you use that, Jeff?
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.520]   Absolutely.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:10.280]   You know, as I get older and my students get younger, I find that they very much prefer
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:14.880]   to send me a text message as opposed to the voice now.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.360]   And what's great is with the Google voice service is when I reply back to their text
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.000]   message, it reflects the Google voice number.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.440]   Again, protecting personal information.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.440]   That's nice.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.200]   So you call back via Google voice.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   Absolutely.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.320]   Yeah, I would think Skype might be a little threatened by Google voice, frankly, because
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.040]   Google voice is going to offer cheaper calls to international calls.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.400]   I think it still needs to be a little bit more, it's still smoother as far as an experience
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.400]   goes to use Skype.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.040]   I think that's one of the things.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.200]   Now we have to say, I apologize for those of you who are listening and saying, well, darn
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   it, I want Google voice because they aren't yet public.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.560]   I don't know if they're going to do that.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.080]   They say they're going to do it.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.200]   But right now, I can't say you're invited.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.000]   We were lucky to sign up for Grand Central.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.440]   Vito came out, you know, I signed up for all that crap.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.080]   You know, every time I see one of those things, I get an invitation from Leo or I get an
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   invitation from somebody else.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.720]   I'm always like, oh, I just signed up with my name in.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.720]   Just do it.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.720]   Just to reserve.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.720]   I do it.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   I do it.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.360]   I have them around a business, but there are a couple that I've, yeah.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.760]   How about you use Google voice, Lewis, or is that something you're aware of?
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.160]   I'm aware of Google voice, obviously.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.680]   Not lucky enough to have the Skype I'm using here.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.560]   You'll see I get kicked off every 20 minutes.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   So why is that?
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   The iPhone's the best thing.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.360]   You know, this happened on other podcasts as well.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360]   We're kind of used to it.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.120]   So we watched the time and then eight minutes all day off and we'll start again.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.960]   Who's your internet service provider?
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.480]   It's Comcast, just like everybody else.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.760]   I have a feeling Comcast is screwing with you.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.440]   Oh, if that's true, we don't have a nail yet.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.040]   We can't complain about this.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.720]   Every 20 minutes is a little too regular.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.440]   If you ask me, that's that's very strange.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   It is.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440]   Wow.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440]   All right.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440]   Well, that's good.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.440]   I'll just keep an eye out and I'll dial you back.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.760]   Carlos, this is another service from fine service from Google that they say they're never offering
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.760]   internationally.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:10.440]   Well, it's always the other countries that get these kind of services that rolled out.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.880]   You know, I have friends in Canada.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.800]   I used to go to Canada all the time and the Canadians are bitter about the fact that iTunes
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:23.400]   is in the Amazon and Hulu and the Kindle and this must really gripe you.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:29.760]   We're also locked out of iTunes, not the app store because the iPhone is a big thing here,
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:35.800]   but it's been in Brazil, I don't know, for less than a year, you know.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.200]   It's huge.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.440]   We can get the apps, but we cannot get tracks from the iTunes store.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.440]   Isn't that ridiculous?
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.440]   And it's all.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.440]   This is all.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.440]   It's not Apple's fault.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440]   Right.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.400]   It's all of the inner-riffed-
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   We do have credit cards.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.480]   Yeah, and I imagine that there's probably a pretty brisk market in credit cards with
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.800]   US addresses.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.640]   I know that in Canada, that's one way people handle that.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.240]   If you have a US address.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.200]   We have ways around it.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.120]   I have an iTunes account.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.920]   I can buy tracks, but it's almost a hack, you know.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:14.680]   You get yourself an American address and then you just do it.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.560]   Carlos, actually doing it.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.760]   Yeah, of course they are, and because there's demand for it.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.680]   I guess it's really the record companies, the publishers, and it's people who are tied
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.320]   to business models that unfortunately are old-fashioned.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.920]   They're fading out.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.920]   They're nationalistic.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.560]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:38.160]   Yeah, I can see some movement being actually starting here to change this.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.080]   We don't get, for once, we don't get Hulu here.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.400]   We don't get Hulu.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.200]   We don't get Fox.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.200]   We don't have that.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:52.000]   And actually, we're also locked out of Lestafem, you know, because it's only, I think, in
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.560]   the United States or Germany, right?
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   Yep.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.560]   Without Pan-Dora too.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]   Love Pan-Dora.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.280]   I hate liking songs on Friend Feed because I know everybody that's outside the US can't
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.280]   listen to.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.280]   How about Blip FM?
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.280]   Can you guys do Blip FM in...
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.920]   Sure, we love Blip FM, man.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.680]   Yes, Blip FM is a way around this.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.160]   And we talk to them.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   I love it.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.240]   It's kind of a Twitter for music, so you pick the song and you blip it and then it goes
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.880]   on your Twitter or your Friend Feed.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.480]   But the songs are coming from other people's posted MP3s.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.680]   So it strikes me as completely, highly illegal.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.160]   However, they say, we interviewed them on Net at night.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.920]   They say, "We've got to deal with the record companies."
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:30.920]   No, no, it's okay.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.600]   So I don't know what they're up to, but I love Blip FM.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.160]   That's a solution for people with international listeners.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.680]   What about Last on FM?
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   Last on FM.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.760]   It doesn't work in Brazil, right?
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:49.880]   Yeah, it used to work before they passed that whole new strategy to charge for outside the
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.080]   US and Germany, right?
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.080]   So, yeah.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:57.120]   A lot of my friends got really bumped out about that.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:04.360]   A lot of them just simply stopped listening to Last FM and they were really, really hooked.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.800]   It's a big thing, especially among tech people here.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:14.080]   Well, Jeff, I thank you for being on the show with us and say hello to all your students
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080]   in Loma Vista.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   Loma Linda.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   I'll be back.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.280]   Thank you so much for having me on.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   Great to talk to you.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.280]   Thank you.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.960]   Yeah, I think we're big fans of Google Voice.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.680]   We look forward to having an available.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.680]   Huge.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.680]   Universally.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.680]   Hey, here's the final shoe finally dropped after years and years of being the laughing
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.080]   stock of the gaming community.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.160]   Duke Nukem Forever is finally well and truly officially dead.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.160]   Dead.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.720]   Thank God.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.680]   This is, actually, I shouldn't say thank God.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.520]   I feel very, very sad for the developer of 3D Realms.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.520]   Developers of 3D Realms.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.000]   I mean, they've been working on this thing for 12 years.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   12 years.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.160]   I'm not going to laugh.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.160]   12 years.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   12 years.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160]   I'm crying.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   I'm not laughing.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.520]   I saw enterprise, you know, software development cycles are long.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520]   12 years.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.000]   And finally, they just ran out of money.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.800]   And that's what we call mission creep.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.160]   Oh, you know, I think that was the issue.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.600]   Talk, take two.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.520]   You're a huge, a huge.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.080]   Say again.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.880]   The original was such a good game.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.080]   Oh, I love Duke Nukem.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.080]   Yes.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.400]   He got me hooked when I was a kid.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.600]   And you know, the trailers we saw, we saw a trailer as recently as a year ago for Duke
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.520]   Nukem Forever that made it look like it was imminent.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.480]   It looked really good.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:34.440]   The problem was forever was actually going to the production cycle.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.560]   If they had actually given it a specific time span, it would have been completed, but
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.400]   their big problem was naming it forever.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.320]   Kind of like an emergency.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.240]   Your mistake is a bad name.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:53.320]   Take two says that they retain the publishing rights to Duke Nukem Forever.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.880]   But they can confirm that the relationship was a publishing agreement only.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:02.680]   It included providing funds and 3D realms is essentially run out of money.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.680]   And evidently, this is it from the chat room from Phil 404.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.840]   It said Duke Nukem is now it's Duke Nukem Forever.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.840]   Forever.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.840]   Yes.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.840]   Thank you.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.560]   Duke Nukem Trilogy, however, continues the handheld version, continues under development
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.200]   with Apogee and Deep Silver.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.960]   Now, some of the also, if you do a little searching around, I think I might have tagged
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.400]   this for Twit.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:27.320]   But some of the artwork, some of the folks who got laid off, some of the galleries.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.960]   Yeah, release some of that stuff.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   They have.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960]   There's some galleries up there.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   I don't know how long they'll be there.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960]   So if you're listening or watching.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.000]   Whatever collateral you've got, release it.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.200]   Go check it out because it's some of the individual artists I think have released it.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.600]   Couldn't somebody come along and take an existing engine and say, "Look, port it over to that?"
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.600]   and say, "Well, we'll do a open source to Duke Nukem."
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   A lot of work.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.600]   You'll do a lot of work.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:51.480]   You know, and take two isn't, it doesn't have any real reason to make that possible.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:59.160]   Or as electronic arts used to call it, "Take 2 Billion."
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.920]   That's what they were going to buy it for.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:01.920]   Wow.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920]   2 billion dollars.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.480]   2 billion dollars.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   Let's see here.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.480]   We're going to get to some more stories in just a second, but I do want to mention, "Alright,
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.840]   this is your chance.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.720]   We're going to see one more time if Rachel uses this."
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.280]   Our next sponsor.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.120]   This is going to be a big curve too.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   I have to check.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   I think it's...
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.000]   Well, I don't want to say that loud until I know.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.160]   Yes it is.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.000]   Go to my PC.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.760]   Rachel, do you...
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.040]   Oh, she's gone.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.040]   She didn't want...
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   Oh, wait a minute, there she is.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.840]   Rachel, do you use...
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.840]   Go to my PC.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.880]   She's going for the hat trick, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.880]   I have used it.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:43.400]   I actually just used it a couple of weeks ago.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.720]   You're lying.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.640]   You're lying to me now.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.280]   No, I'm not.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   You are...
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.960]   You've actually hit for the hat trick, Rachel.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   The trifecta.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960]   The trifecta.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.960]   Tell me...
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.160]   My co-hosts on my show, we're all in different states.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:05.320]   We kicked turns editing and it was my co-host in California's turn.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.840]   There were some mix ups with the files and we had to realign all three of our tracks
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.360]   back up together and she had no idea how to do it.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.080]   She installed it and I went on and taught her how to do it.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.080]   Unbelievable.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.080]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.080]   There you go.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080]   That's great for tech support.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.800]   With access to your system, nobody these days wants to stay at work any longer than you have
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.200]   to, especially if you're surrounded by people who are sick with the flu.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.600]   You want to go home and if you're sick, you want to be able to stay home.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.080]   Go to my PC, let's you do that.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.800]   You don't have to be a tech expert.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.680]   You figured Rachel, would you call yourself a tech expert?
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.280]   I'm medium.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.280]   Medium.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.360]   Did you find it difficult to set up, difficult to use?
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.160]   No, it's very easy.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.160]   That's because it's from Citrix.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.040]   You guys really know what they're doing.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.680]   Sometimes it takes the biggest, the more expert you are, the better you're able to make something
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680]   easy to use.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.320]   They've been doing this for years.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.640]   Wherever you are in a hotel in New York, on the couch in your living room, an internet
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.800]   cafe in Borneo, at Rachel's house trying to help her partner.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   You can use it.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.520]   You can access any program work on any file.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.520]   Check your email.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.080]   Rachel, you're amazing.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.680]   You have used every one of our products here.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.480]   I can stuff all this stuff from Daily Giz with that we've bought.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.640]   What let me ask you on your podcast, is there any gear that you need for that podcast that
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.160]   you'd really like to have?
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:34.760]   Like a microphone, a recorder, anything I can send you as a gift to thank you for playing
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.160]   our home game?
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.240]   Off the top of my hand, I don't know.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.680]   Well, think about it, Rachel's.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.320]   Let me give you my email address.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   Actually, how am I going to do this?
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.240]   Because I want to make sure it's actually you.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:53.040]   Well, what is your email address from your podcast?
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.040]   That would work.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.000]   Okay, so you'll be the only person able to use that address.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.400]   Girls night out podcast.com.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.320]   Send me an email, leo@leoville.com.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.320]   Tell me what you need.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.120]   I'm going to send you a prize.

[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.080]   They're really a great company.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.840]   I've known them for years and they make a fantastic product.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:27.120]   If you need remote access, that's the way to go.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.560]   Rachel said, so cool.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.720]   We're going to do this every show from now on.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.040]   Just going to, just going to get our listeners on here.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.520]   So Biz Stone goes on the view.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.920]   I am, these Twitter guys.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.920]   Don't give me stars.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.400]   They become movie stars.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.960]   So now Biz Stone is on the view with, oh look.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   Got it.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:46.960]   Can't start this story.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   20 minutes.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.960]   20 minutes on.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   That's 20 minutes.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:50.960]   They're up.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.680]   I got to get Louis back on because I don't want to do a Twitter story without the friend
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   feed guy on here.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.680]   Louis is the biggest friend feed evangelist.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.760]   Louis, you don't have an investment or stock in the company or anything, do you?
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.440]   You're just a fan of the company.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.440]   As am I.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.280]   I've been using them for a long time.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.640]   I recognize their potential very early on.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:14.120]   I was responsible for getting Scoble on there, so I apologize on his behalf.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.680]   So that was you.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:21.800]   Well, but yeah, but Louis, I think if, because I can't remember how I got on, but probably
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.160]   Biz because Scoble was using it.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.800]   It might have been, might have been because of you.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:32.280]   I don't remember exactly when I, but boy, as good as friend feed was, this new live real
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.760]   time beta.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.200]   It's a killer app now.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.200]   I mean, this is, this is so awesome.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.880]   So the rumor is really, it's obviously become a great destination for live events.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.640]   You can see the chat room just flowing.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.640]   571 comics.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.040]   And friend feed, obviously, it really kind of has the two pieces to it.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]   Number one is your friends.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.920]   That's what the friend part is for and the second part is your feeds and that can be
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.920]   anything.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:59.320]   It really is a top notch aggregation service gets all of your details from all the services
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.480]   you're already on.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   And then it enables a conversation platform.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.720]   A lot of people like to say friend feed versus Twitter, but Twitter is an important
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.600]   ingredient in friend feed.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.520]   It really does get those updates from around the web and put them into your feed and let
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520]   you talk to your friends.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.240]   But what it also lets you do is have threaded conversations, comments that last more than
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.520]   140 characters, unless you have pictures, let you have video.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.040]   It just makes sense.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.800]   And so it's not one of those situations where you have to choose one or the other, but it's
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   really kind of difference between radio and a color television with cable.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:34.800]   Right?
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.960]   You sure you don't stock in this there?
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.080]   I don't need to own stock to know it's a good company.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.840]   So Twitter is basically got one thing down and that's text that's short to your friends
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.160]   and following your friends.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.160]   And that's it.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.720]   That's all they do.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.320]   They haven't customized really anything in the last two years with the exception of making
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.840]   sure that the site doesn't crash every 20 minutes like my Skype connection.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.520]   But you kind of admire them for keeping it simple, right?
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.680]   But at the same time, the function and sometimes people say that the friend feed is hard to
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.600]   use because it's functionality is so much.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.600]   Right.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.320]   And I don't find that to be the case to be.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.240]   I would say the same thing to be honest.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.800]   At times I've requested that they find a way to make a lighter version for people who
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.960]   are coming in new.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.400]   If I came in today and saw all the features that they have today, it might be overwhelming.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.920]   I would have to learn how to hide things, block things, delete things.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.240]   If you're used to something like Twitter where you follow thousands of people, you can't
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.240]   just jump in on friend feed and expect to do the same thing because it's a much richer
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.240]   experience.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.440]   Well, Kim Kardashian can.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.280]   Did she see that?
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.680]   Yes, she followed 45,000 people.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.800]   I was one of the lucky ones who didn't get followed, which is good.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.920]   So as I understand it, Kim is, of course, Kim is some sort of be great celebrity with
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.640]   a large memory glance, which apparently is her key to success.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.920]   And there's a reality show on her, I believe.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:55.920]   Right.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.240]   I mean, I never heard of the name, but anyway, she was on Twitter, I gather, and then had
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.480]   quite a few followers on Twitter.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.760]   Now, there's this new thing on friend feed where when you join friend feed, you can add
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.680]   your Twitter social graph to friend feed.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.360]   All your followers are in friends.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.120]   Is that what it was, Lewis?
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.280]   You can log in using your Twitter credentials using OAuth and in a single click it will
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.520]   check your friend feed.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.920]   It'll check all of friend feed for people who you're already connected to on Twitter
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.480]   and automatically subscribe you to.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.560]   So that's what happened, right?
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:27.800]   She got her friends from Twitter, just she added them.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.000]   So if she already had hundreds of thousands, and I don't know, because obviously I don't
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.600]   follow the lady, but if you've got hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter and you
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.200]   happen to have 20 to 40 percent of them already checking out friend feed, then she would have
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.440]   been automatically subscribed to dozens of thousands of people.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.840]   The interesting coverage around that was that less than 1 percent of those people she'd
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.480]   followed followed her back.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.000]   If you look at her feed, isn't that much going on?
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.800]   No, a lot of people tend to use friend feed as kind of a dumping ground for their tweets.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:05.080]   And that's the thing you really don't want to be doing on friend feed because people immediately
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.480]   says, "Well, I see she's got 905 subscribers, 45,000 subscriptions."
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.160]   So that's a 2 percent return, right?
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.560]   So what that means is if she goes to friend feed, it's going to scroll by at a pretty
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   rapid clip.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.880]   Well, yeah, I don't think she's visiting.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   Yeah, let me scroll over.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.080]   If you go back up to the top, it should show how many comments and like she's ever made
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.400]   and since I don't play, it's yours.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.400]   No.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   So she's not the best person to give the good friend feed experience.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.920]   If you would type in either your own or my own address, you could get a better idea for
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.640]   the type of things that do occur.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.600]   That's one of the neat things that you can do with friend feed is you can see, you can
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.080]   kind of, for instance, you can see a Scobles friend feed, right?
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.480]   You can see what it looks like for him.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.960]   And what is it?
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.200]   Friends/scobelizer?
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.200]   Is that how I would do it?
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:57.160]   Well, you would go to friendfeed.com/scobelizer and there's a link in there that would show
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.840]   who he is subscribed to.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.840]   Okay.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.840]   I'll just side with you.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.840]   23,000 subscriptions.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.640]   And if I click that, well, I see.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.000]   So you click it, you get all the names.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.640]   Okay.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:10.280]   So I could see who he's following.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.240]   But then I can also see his stream, I could see how fast it goes.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.880]   I'm trying to remember what it...
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.920]   I think it's friends.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.920]   I mean, it's kind of fun.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.920]   He did this to me once.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.440]   He said, "Well, type this in and then you can see how fast my stream goes."
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.360]   And it's kind of like scary.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.840]   He did a quick video last week.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.840]   That was just fascinating to me.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:34.840]   I was always curious of how he handles the noise.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.440]   Well, he was a librarian.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:40.200]   He's a different person from everybody else.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:46.240]   Anyway, this started because there was a really incredibly stupid rumor from Fast Company.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.920]   I mean, just stupid rumor that Apple was going to buy Twitter.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.120]   Which doesn't make any sense.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.120]   Made no sense.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.120]   Everybody.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.560]   I mean, I'll fall for these.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.800]   I'm pretty bad at falling for these.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.120]   God, who is this big story?
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.360]   Well, I thought Jared was dead because Kevin Rose tweeted it out.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.040]   You followed for that?
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.760]   See, I didn't fall for that one.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.760]   But I didn't...
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.360]   And this one, this Apple's going to buy Twitter immediately said, "I don't care who they know
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.840]   or what source they've got."
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.840]   That's ridiculous.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:18.400]   And of course, Biz Stone goes on the view and tells Baba Wawa, "We're not for sale."
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.400]   Which is what I always thought.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.400]   I was getting started.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.400]   Well, I always thought that.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.480]   First of all, Ev made plenty of money selling a blogger to Google.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.480]   Right.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.480]   He's sitting on a pile of money, a pile of dough.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.320]   He doesn't need to monetize.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.880]   You know, it's going to be more and more valuable.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.120]   It's kind of like Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.120]   Why should they sell?
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.120]   Read what Jack is doing next.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.880]   Yeah, Jack has a new...
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:42.320]   Jack Dorsey, who invented the idea of Twitter and was kind of forced out as CEO of Twitter
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.560]   by Ev just a few months ago.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.560]   What's his new business?
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:46.560]   He's got something new.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.560]   It's called Project Squirrel.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.560]   That's all I've...
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.560]   It was a squirrel.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.560]   It's a squirrel.
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.560]   It's a tech crunch.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.400]   And it's apparently a hardware and a software device for the iPhone.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.200]   That allows you to convert points of sale.
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   Yeah, it's a point of sale.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.200]   You can take credit card.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   Okay, so you can...
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.200]   But they already got that.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.520]   It's a big ad that Apple shows a big ad of that all the time.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.840]   Like, "Oh, look, you could take credit card."
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.320]   I don't even know why I would want to.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.960]   Apparently, there's some hardware that you could slide the credit card through and it
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.960]   doesn't need power.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:16.120]   Yeah, and it looks like an acorn, which is why it's Project Squirrel.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.920]   Silly, silly, silly.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.960]   They might as well add springboard modules if you guys remember those.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.080]   That was...
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.080]   Who did that?
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.080]   That's...
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.080]   Handspring.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.080]   Handspring.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.080]   Handspring.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.080]   Whatever happened to that?
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.080]   The end spring...
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.080]   Wired by Palm, if you remember that.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.080]   I actually had one of the first visor phones.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.080]   Visor.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.080]   That's what I was trying to remember.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.480]   I had to get off my desk because I wouldn't fit in my pocket.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   Yeah, I know.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480]   And you could add all the...
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480]   You could add the hardware, a little plug-in hardware.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.480]   Handspring, yeah.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   Right.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   Well, I think that one of the things as far as import-y stuff, and I don't know anything
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.840]   about Project Squirrel, but I know that the one thing about Point of Purchase is that you
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.800]   can't use the iPhone...
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.760]   You can't use the iPhone to take pictures of the barcode because it doesn't focus.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.400]   That's why I have a clarified case because I'm not going to do that.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   But you can't use it.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.400]   Yeah, you haven't seen this?
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.720]   This has a little magnifying glass.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.560]   It slides over so you can take close-ups.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.080]   I just lost point.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.080]   You lost your clarifying.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.080]   I love it.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.080]   That's the top part of it.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   Oh, that's a bummer.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.080]   Just like two days ago.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.080]   I love the Clarify case.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.080]   The G1 can do it.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.320]   G1 is a great phone, and you're a G1 user.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.320]   Yeah, I do both.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.240]   I mean, these are my two development platforms.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240]   Me too?
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.240]   Well, I don't develop, but I just...
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.240]   These are my two...
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.240]   You're very sparse, I don't...
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.240]   My problems?
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.240]   You know why?
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.240]   I just restored it.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.240]   Oh, I was like...
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.440]   No, I just restored it.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   The thing that I call...
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.440]   That's what I call...
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:38.040]   I jail broke my phone, and I screwed it up.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.360]   There's this mode DfU, which stands for what...
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.760]   Should stand for what you think it stands for, because the disk is f-u-ed.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.760]   And I...
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.200]   So I jail broke it, and it never has been right since I restored it.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.440]   It's never been right since so finally I did the DfU restore, and I'm hoping this will
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.440]   be.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.760]   So you want to take a picture or something?
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:54.760]   I'm trying to find a...
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.760]   A barcode.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.120]   Please grab me one of those books.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120]   So...
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.120]   Yeah, we'll do the new computer.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.120]   www.xsquirrel.org.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:05.120]   McNealy says, "Project Squirrel...
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.440]   No, that's not it.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.960]   Become a citizen scientist.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.240]   Click here to record your squirrel observations."
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:15.240]   I don't believe that Jack Dorsey's next business.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.080]   No, there was something on TechCrunch.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080]   No, no, no.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.080]   I don't know.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.080]   I think this was a...
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.080]   This was a wag.
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.080]   A wag making a joke.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.080]   Alright, let me see.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   That's what's clear.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.080]   Yeah, no, no.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.080]   It's a really nice thing.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.080]   It works with Evernote very nicely.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080]   If you're going to do...
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080]   You want to use the Evernote.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.080]   Because that's been the big thing that's been missing as far as being able to just buy
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.080]   stuff.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.600]   Let me try it with the J-1.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.560]   Being able to just buy stuff from your iPhone.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.800]   Yeah, he's going to show off now.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.800]   Brian's going to...
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.800]   I've never tried.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.800]   I just got this phone like less than we...
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.000]   Oh, you've got to try the barcode application.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   You'll look up this thing.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   Get the final cheapest...
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   It's outrageous.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   The bar...
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   Lewis, are you an iPhone guy?
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   I've got mine right here.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.080]   When are we going to get a friend feed iPhone app?
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.080]   That's what I want to know.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.080]   That's a good question.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.080]   You don't have to talk about that.
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.080]   You kind of...
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:05.080]   Realtime doesn't work too well.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.080]   Right.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.080]   Friendfeed.com/iPhone is there.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:12.240]   It's a great improvement over the original mobile app, which was FF2Go.com, which is still
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.440]   good for non-iPhone mobiles.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.720]   The Friend Feed interface is intended to actually just work in the iPhone.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.040]   But they haven't yet made it out.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.600]   But I would love to see realtime in an iPhone app.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.600]   Right.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.600]   That would be awesome.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.600]   There is also a NAMBO.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.600]   NAMBO is another part.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600]   NAMBO too, yeah.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.600]   But again, not realtime.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.520]   What we really wanted is some scrolling.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.520]   Nintendo is hot, more gaming news.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:43.760]   Nintendo's annual profit of 8.5% thanks to success of the Wii and the DS doing much better
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.080]   than even Toyota and Hitachi.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:53.480]   They're actually probably one of the most successful international companies in Japan
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.520]   right now.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.920]   They say they're going to expect a 7.5% rise in that profits.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.920]   What are you doing over there?
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.320]   So no, there is.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:04.320]   No, I've used that.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:05.320]   It's incredible.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.520]   If I was a Amazon, I'd be threatened by this.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.440]   Well, you took a picture of the barcode and it looks it up and finds it online.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.360]   In fact, you could be in a bookstore, take a picture of a road.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.360]   Well, my Amazon is going to be threatened.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.360]   It's borders.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.360]   It's what's threatened.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.560]   You go into borders and you take a picture of the barcode and then it says, "Oh, you can
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.000]   find it cheaper down the road."
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.960]   Well, the worst part for me is that I sit there and take a picture of the cover of the
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.800]   book because I can send it to Amazon Remembers.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.240]   So I look at, "Oh, I really want this book and take a picture of the cover."
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:37.160]   We had an argument over when you should buy a book from borders online and some people
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   will order it from Amazon while they're still in the store.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.680]   I say that you have to get out to the sidewalk.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.080]   All right, we're going to wrap this up in a unique way.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.200]   This is the volunteer edition of "Twit and It's Been Great."
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:52.080]   I think we should, we have so many people in our talk shoot chat room that I'm just going
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.080]   to cycle through them.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.240]   What's your big story of the week?
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.720]   So we're going to just cycle through the people who've asked to be called on starting
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.120]   with Ben Gold, your first.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.320]   I'm sorry, it's not you, Ben.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.320]   It's Phyllis.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.320]   Phyllis.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.800]   How do you pronounce it?
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.400]   Hey, is it Phyllis?
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.720]   Phyllis?
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.720]   I'm here.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720]   Yep, we're here.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.040]   How do you pronounce your handle?
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040]   It would be Phyllis.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040]   Phyllis.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.040]   And where are you from, Phyllis?
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.920]   Canada, California.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.480]   And what do you think is the big story that we should be covering on "Twit" this week?
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.480]   I don't know.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.080]   I'm still thinking about Windows release Canada and how well it's going.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:34.000]   And some people in the chat room were wondering, still wondering how you thought it was going
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.520]   to do in terms of whatever...
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.680]   We haven't mentioned the fact that is actually a big story I kind of left out.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:43.680]   Thank you for reminding me that Windows 7 release candidate came out this week.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.160]   I'm sure millions have downloaded it.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.160]   I haven't seen numbers.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.160]   I immediately downloaded it.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.920]   I have to say, I was saying the best version of Windows since Windows 2000.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.600]   I'm now saying the best version of Windows ever.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.600]   Wow.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.960]   Yeah, this is a remarkable comeback, I think, from Microsoft.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.200]   No, what made it?
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.120]   Well, XP was a big improvement over Windows 98.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.440]   They went to the NT kernel.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:12.360]   They got some robustness, some multi-user functionality, a login, meant something in
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360]   XP.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.480]   But it looked like a Fisher Price interface.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.400]   I mean, it went big, colorful buttons.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.880]   It was just goofy looking.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   First thing I do is go back to my phone.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880]   The search dog.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.880]   Give me a break.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   The search dog.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.600]   You go to search, a little puppy comes out.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.640]   You have to wait for it to come out.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.000]   Then you type your search and you have to wait for it to go look, what do they think
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   we are?
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.640]   Four-year-old morons?
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:38.440]   So okay, XP, not my favorite operating system, not to mention all the security issues.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:42.120]   Vista, you know, the problem with Vista is it was five years in.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.480]   It wasn't done and they said we can't hold on any longer.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.960]   So they released it knowing that they were going to be faced with huge, it was not only
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.600]   heavy but huge compatibility issues.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.240]   And it really hurt Vista.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.320]   By the time service pack one came out, Vista wasn't any lighter but at least it worked
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.320]   with everything.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.320]   But it was too late.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.760]   The public perception of Vista was this thing is ugly.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.960]   It doesn't work.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.080]   So they said, I think they did the right thing, which is they said, all right, we're
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:13.760]   not going to make any major changes in the core of this thing but we are going to polish
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:14.760]   it up.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.840]   We're going to get rid of the bloat.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.680]   We're going to make sure it works with everything.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.680]   And that's what they've done.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.640]   And so really Windows 7 is Vista for all intents and purposes with all the rough edges
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.640]   polished off.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.840]   It's slick, it's fast.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.840]   It's much faster.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.840]   It runs fine on a netbook.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:29.840]   You can put it on the Acer.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.840]   Oh man, it runs great.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.160]   Well, in a lot of ways, isn't that one, Snow leopard is going to be for Apple?
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.160]   That's what Apple is.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.160]   Same operating system.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.160]   It's a coincidence.
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.160]   I think what's happening is that operating systems are fairly mature.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.480]   There's not a lot of new stuff you could put in one.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:48.400]   This is the time for both Apple and Microsoft to say, let's sit back, let's take what we've
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:52.600]   got, not add major new features, not change the file system, but make it better.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.880]   Now, what Apple needs to do is they really need to update the file system.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.240]   HFS is long on the tooth.
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.160]   It is not the best operating system out there.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.720]   I presume moving to ZFS is just fantastic.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.440]   Which is a huge improvement over any file system anybody's ever used.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.320]   I mean, this is the file system of the future.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.400]   Everything that you get with RAID, all the redundancy, the time you're seeing.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.760]   When you're really starting moving towards being able to do a cloud of data.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.240]   I got a bunch of drives that are all piped in.
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.240]   I can pull drives out, put drives in.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.920]   So we're still HFS on the Mac.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.200]   We're still in TFS on Windows.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.240]   However, in every other respect, I think it's time to set back, retrench and say, let's
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.240]   make this better.
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.840]   That's what they really have done that with Windows 7.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.800]   So, if I was to answer your question, yeah, I think it's great.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.440]   I did this on the radio show and I think what I made a mistake because I think a lot of
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.920]   people started downloading Windows 7.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.480]   Some things remember, it's beta, it's not released yet.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.760]   You're going to have to reinstall at some point if either when it comes out in September
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:48.760]   or October.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.640]   And we know, by the way, that it will be out October 23rd because Acer accidentally told
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.640]   everybody that.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:29:00.600]   We're going to sell a computer with Windows 7 on it October 23rd.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.720]   So basically, that's pre-announced for Microsoft.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.440]   It may even before then.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.160]   But even if you do install the beta, and by the way, they're not limiting it, anybody
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.160]   can get it.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.800]   You can download the 32-bit or the 64-bit or both.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.440]   You get a serial number, it's going to be good for a year, it's going to be good through
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:16.440]   2010.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.960]   I've had a number of friends that go, oh, I wish I could run it.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.360]   Well, whether or not you can, you can just go out and get a free for a year and it's
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.880]   a Windows operating, but the perfect legitimate is wonderful.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.600]   It's an important paradigm shift for Microsoft.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:33.240]   Have any of you guys tried on using it on VMware as an image?
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.240]   Yes.
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.600]   Does it work well?
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.040]   I just got my MacBook Pro and I'm thinking about trying it.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:45.120]   I'm going to tell you, I have got another little thing, in fact, I'll probably tell
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.280]   you about this on Mac Break Weekly also.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:52.440]   I started using Sun's VirtualBox, which is a free version of Parallels or VMware.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:59.080]   And it's free, it's every bit as good, and Windows 7 runs great on it.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:03.320]   Well, and the thing is, this is really right now, if you're going to have a dual boot machine,
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.040]   this is a great way to do it because you get it free for a year.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.040]   Free free year.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.520]   So if you're going to get VMware or Parallels or Sun, the thing to do is do that.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.960]   So now you get either with the boot system, what is it?
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:17.960]   A boot camp.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:18.960]   Boot camp.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:25.200]   Or with a VirtualBox from Sun, you get a completely, and Windows 7 Macintosh use to
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.760]   get Windows for free.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:27.760]   For free.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.760]   For a year.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.200]   I doubt that there are going to be a lot of them sliding.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.040]   In a year, it's going to stop running every two hours.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.800]   It's going to have the Lewis Gray effect.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.520]   As you're starting to try to figure out how much are you going to actually use it, because
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:44.360]   there are a lot of, you know, all of our new machines, all our dual boot.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.960]   And there are definitely legitimate reasons we're going over to Windows.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.240]   Now, I have to admit, we're still on XP.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.240]   So we'll move on.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.240]   This is time.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.280]   I really think this is the program that you're going to want to use.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:56.040]   It is a really awesome program.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.560]   fellas, thank you for reminding me.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:04.240]   And yes, I do think it's the best version of Windows ever in terms of performance, reliability,
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.240]   security.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:10.840]   I mean, if you're still using XP for security alone, you need to move to Windows 7.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.840]   Definitely.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.240]   Yeah, I'm not crazy about IE8, but so what?
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.240]   You put Firefox on there and you're fine.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.200]   First thing you're doing.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.200]   Thank you, fellas, for calling.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.200]   I appreciate it.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.200]   I'm Paul Monolio.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.200]   You're great.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.200]   Take care.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.200]   Thanks for listening.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.800]   Thanks for being on our first volunteer tweet.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.800]   What?
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:27.800]   Element one.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.600]   Hey, Leo, Element J.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.600]   Jay, I'm sorry.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.560]   One looks like Jay to me because I'm old.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.280]   Where are you calling from?
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.880]   I'm in San Antonio.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.720]   Did we miss a big story element, Jay?
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:44.280]   No, you just hit on it with Windows 7.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.840]   I'm just surprised that I'm out of my closet.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:52.960]   I dug up a six-year-old thinkpad that I had installed Windows 7 on it and completely just
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.480]   amazed at the performance that I got out of that six-year-old laptop.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.480]   Wow.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.800]   That's a testimony.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.680]   And then it makes you wonder, well, why couldn't they do that before?
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.920]   What were they doing with Vista?
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.040]   It took them five years and they came out with a pig.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:13.800]   I think when you're writing fast and you're adding features, it's a lot harder to get back
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.720]   to clean code, to get back straight to the metal.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:20.160]   So maybe that's the key is, yeah, you're a developer, Brian.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.280]   So the key is you sit back and you say, OK, let's fix this.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.280]   We've got our template.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.280]   We've got our roadmap.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.840]   Let's go back and fix it.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:33.720]   Yeah, I suspect that Vista got so bloated as a project that it became almost impossible
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.720]   to manage.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.680]   And when you're a developer and you have to write unit tests--
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   Lean into the mic there.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.160]   You have a little functional test, unit tests.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.560]   It makes it really hard.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.000]   Now you're using a netbook there.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.520]   Windows 7 and Run Grade on that.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520]   That's Adam-based, right?
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520]   You're a fan of the Adam-based.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.200]   You said something kind of provocative before we began.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.000]   You thought Adam was going to be a revolution.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.600]   I think the Adam processor is a game-changing device.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:01.160]   Because I get seven hours of battery life with the N280 chip.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.160]   What?
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.360]   You're getting seven hours?
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.360]   You're using the EPC.
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.720]   It's the brand new 1000 HE.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:08.720]   How much is it?
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:09.720]   It's a six-cell or a nine-cell?
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:10.720]   It's a six-cell battery.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.640]   You're getting seven hours?
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.640]   Just about between six and seven.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.640]   Wow.
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.640]   I have to trade in because I'm having this.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.640]   I win.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.160]   I've had it on for the entire time I've been here.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.720]   And I still have an hour and a half left.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.720]   That's awesome.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.720]   You know, I was on the entire time.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.720]   Yeah, you were sitting out in the...
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.720]   Yeah, wow.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.720]   That's impressive.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.720]   So much better than...
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:29.040]   And it was 400 bucks.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.120]   It was 400 bucks in the day I got it.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.920]   That's the new ACES EPC.
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:33.920]   What's the model number?
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920]   1000 HE.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920]   Oh, the HE.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920]   Okay.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.960]   Amazon is where I bought five of them.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.200]   Not for yourself, for employees.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.120]   And I dropped it the first day on concrete, literally.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.800]   And it chipped off a piece, but it didn't crash XP.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:50.800]   Lean in.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.800]   It still works.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.800]   Use that mic.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800]   I'm still using it.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.800]   That's your mic.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:56.960]   And I love it.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:57.960]   Element J, you had a question?
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:00.240]   No, it's just a pointer.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.120]   No, Brian, what kind of battery life he did on the D1?
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.120]   He Brian and I both use the G1.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.120]   Okay.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.120]   So...
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.120]   Socks.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.120]   iPhone G1.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.120]   Sock.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.800]   I charge them up in the morning and they don't last me to the evening.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:14.800]   Even the iPhone...
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.800]   You're not gonna get bolder them.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.920]   You're getting better battery life on my iPhone.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.920]   I...
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.320]   No, I think I get better battery life on the G1.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.320]   Really?
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:22.320]   Personally.
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.160]   I don't know if my iPhone just sucks or what, but I can't get through a day with either.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.360]   And I'm using both of them for similar things.
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.120]   I'm posting pictures of the internet.
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.200]   I'm browsing for NVID.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.960]   I'm doing tweets, tweets, whatever.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.960]   I love the software.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:36.960]   I love Android.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.320]   I really think that this is just bad hardware.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:44.600]   Now we're gonna see this week, in fact, T-Mobile says version 1.5 cupcake.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.960]   And the code name cupcake of the Android operating system will be out.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.800]   I don't know if I'd really name my version.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.800]   I don't know.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.800]   Is that the official name cupcake?
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.800]   I don't know.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:54.280]   That's what they're calling it.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.920]   That could make a big difference in a lot of things, including as we've seen with the
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.640]   iPhone, it could be battery life.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.520]   Well, in 3.0 iPhone, apparently that's the big.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:05.000]   Well, I was impressed with 2.2.2.2.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.600]   Got much better battery life for me.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.200]   I think you're getting unusually bad battery life.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.200]   I think I am.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:11.200]   But I'm not on the G1.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.200]   That's just terrible.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.440]   Do you have Alamo J? Are you thinking of buying an Android phone or?
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.440]   No, I got one when they came out back in October.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.960]   I sent mine back because of the battery life.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.680]   And I stuck with my iPhone 3G.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.720]   But I get some poor battery life also on my iPhone.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.160]   I go the whole day and guys buy one o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.160]   And I'm not using it.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.880]   I'm a person within my pocket all day.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.120]   All we ask, look, it's a smartphone.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.200]   It's not gonna be like your Motorola rocker.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.400]   It's gonna-- you're gonna have to-- but all we ask is we get through the day.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.120]   Yeah, it's an internet device.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.600]   Just let me get through the day.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.600]   I have to--
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.720]   And don't tell me to turn off features.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:52.720]   No, without turning off Wi-Fi.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:58.120]   I find it with my second generation iPhone if I charge it every night.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.120]   And I don't charge it every night.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.560]   Now, if I turn off Wi-Fi, I can go three, three, three, three days.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.560]   Yeah, no, yeah.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.560]   You can turn off the wireless.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:10.360]   But with Wi-Fi on, I-- typically, I never have an issue where it runs out of battery
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.840]   inside of a one-day period.
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.840]   Unless I'm playing Minesweeper too much.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.840]   Or--
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.440]   That with Wi-Fi and 3G off?
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.440]   I don't.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440]   No, no, no.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:26.400]   I mean, with Wi-Fi and 3G on, unless I'm playing field runners too much on a bus or
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.840]   on a plane, I will not run out in a good way.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:29.840]   It's interesting.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.320]   It sounds like there's some real variation.
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.320]   Yeah, well, I mean, because I don't play games.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.320]   I use it as internet.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.320]   I browse the internet.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.160]   I send SMS messages.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:40.480]   I do GPS.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.480]   I do maps.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.480]   And that's about it.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.480]   And I can't get through a day.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.400]   Element J, I thank you for being on the show.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.400]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.400]   Appreciate it.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.400]   Thank you for calling.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.520]   I think we lost Lewis once more.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:56.000]   And it doesn't seem to be getting back through.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.800]   So Lewis Gray, I thank you for being here at Lewis Gray dot com.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.080]   And next time you know, you just got to shout out.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.160]   You just got to yell if you want to be on this show.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:06.160]   Right, Carlos?
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.160]   You just yell.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.160]   I got something to say.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.160]   Yes, of course.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.160]   Always.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:16.240]   Yeah, I mean, it's always been like, as it ever has been, it's a little harder when
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:20.720]   there are people in studio as Brian and Alex and I are if you're a person on Skype.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:23.320]   And so I apologize for making a little.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.520]   It's a different interaction.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.520]   But I thank you for being here.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:27.520]   I really appreciate it, Carlos.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.000]   Hey, thanks for having me.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   It's great to talk to you.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000]   And I'll send you some pictures, maybe.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000]   I don't know if I want any good size.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.240]   Sounds like it's going to hurt a whole.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.400]   You need correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.560]   What you need is the proper amount of sugar and limes.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.760]   Oh, all right.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.480]   And then you get a fine drink.
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.000]   You need the green limes, not the yellow one.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000]   Absolutely.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000]   The little green limes.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.760]   So you take some sugar, you take some little green limes, you squeeze the limes, you mix
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:00.400]   in the sugar, you take the kinsasha, you throw it out and you drink the lime juice and sugar.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.360]   No, no, I'll make you some.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.920]   I'll make you some.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:04.920]   You drink the whole thing.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:05.920]   It's so good.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.320]   The most popular drinks around.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:13.840]   When I was in Brazil, I have to admit, I think I was comfortably numb most of the time.
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:14.840]   Oh, my.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.840]   I was a great drink, actually.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:17.840]   I tell you.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:22.040]   After the second caipirinha, it's all downhill.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.560]   Carlos, you drink him on the beach.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.240]   How is it that you're English is so good?
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.040]   Did you study English in school or?
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.840]   I lived in Oklahoma.
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:31.840]   There you go.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:32.840]   With the redneck.
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.840]   That'll do it.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.680]   Well, it's been great having you on the show.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.680]   I really appreciate your being here.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.680]   Thanks.
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:39.680]   Thanks.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.680]   Thanks to all of you guys.
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.640]   Our volunteer Twit Carlos Shavir.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.640]   He's on Twitter.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.960]   Carlos Gustavo, one word.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.960]   Follow him.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.960]   Please.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.960]   Please.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:49.960]   Twitter.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:50.960]   He needs Twitter followers.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.400]   That's trying to be Ashton Kutcher.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:58.080]   You know, that would be a great goal is just to pick somebody out of the blue and say,
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.640]   let's let's beat Ashton Kutcher.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.640]   Let's take Twitter back.
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:01.640]   Release a press release.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.640]   Leo the poor.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.640]   We should do that.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:04.640]   Not me.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640]   Carlos.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.640]   Carlos.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.640]   Yes.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:08.920]   Just some random person.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.020]   Follow me.
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:12.020]   Thank you, Carlos.
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.020]   Okay.
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:14.020]   Thank you so much.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:15.020]   Take care.
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.020]   We're going to hang up on Carlos.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.480]   I have a few more people in our talk shoe though.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.320]   Let's go quickly to our next talk shoe caller and that's Flargo.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320]   Hey, Flargo.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320]   Hello, everyone.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:27.760]   It's good to have you where you called from today.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.240]   It's been a while.
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:30.400]   I'm up in Seattle.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.040]   I'm a listener.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.280]   I started following you about five months ago.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.280]   Well, thank you.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.360]   You're welcome to the show.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:42.360]   So everyone else seems to be talking about Windows 7 and well, that's a.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.360]   I'm actually going to chime in on Duke Nukem.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:50.880]   I've been following that game for over 10 years and I never really hoped that it would
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.720]   come out, but it kind of little tears from it.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.720]   You finally been canceled.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:57.720]   I mean, that's a heartbreaker.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.320]   Although it was the butt of many a joke.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.560]   I mean, I think I all saw the writing on the wall here.
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.560]   My joke included.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.560]   Duke Nukem forever.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.400]   That was the mistake was the name.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.400]   Did not finish.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:12.240]   Did not finish.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.680]   Well, it's great to talk to you, Flargo.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:19.280]   We appreciate your being here and thanks for listening to the show.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.600]   I appreciate you being there.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.600]   All right.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.600]   Take care.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.760]   Bye bye, Flargo in Seattle.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.160]   Now a data lore.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.160]   Hey, data lore.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.960]   Where are you calling from?
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.320]   Top lane in Ireland.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.000]   Oh, it's nice to talk to you.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]   Thank you for calling.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   It's kind of late at night.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000]   You're staying up late.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]   Or early in the morning.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.720]   That's your 10s of case, maybe.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.720]   I hope you don't have to work in the morning.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:45.400]   I actually do believe it or not, but I'm working on a college project tonight.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.480]   So you can feel sorry for me now.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.480]   That's great.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.960]   Well, are there any stories on your mind that we missed or anything you want to comment
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.560]   on and what we've talked about so far?
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.760]   Yeah, mostly there was an article that I came across yesterday on seeing that regarding
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:04.200]   the European Union wanting to make software makers liable for their code.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.280]   What you were talking about, like with the trouble with business and stuff like that.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:13.880]   I know the BSA aren't really kind of going ahead with any planter actually criticizing.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.360]   But I think personally, I think software makers, software developers should be liable for their
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.360]   code.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.760]   Well, that's going to, maybe you're right.
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.880]   I mean, maybe kind of morally and ethically they have some responsibility.
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:29.280]   But my goodness, if you're considering a software business and you know that you could
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.760]   be sued if your code doesn't live up to somebody's expectations, that's going to put a pretty
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.080]   big chill on the business.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.240]   Look at Brian, you're a developer.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.920]   What do you think of that idea that you should be liable?
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.760]   What if companies sued you?
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.560]   Well, they wouldn't sue me.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.560]   They would sue the company I work for.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.560]   Right.
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.120]   Maybe in the open source community, people can be held liable if they contribute a piece
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:55.640]   of code that blows chunks or brings down a site.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:59.200]   But you know, every time you open a piece of code, it says.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.200]   You're not liable.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.240]   Don't you, however you use this.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:06.360]   There's, you know, every time you install a piece of software, there's a checkbox and
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.880]   you have to agree to the terms.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:08.880]   Right.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.720]   Those terms typically spell out the service level agreements for that type of thing.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.520]   And it's not any one single developer that's going to be held liable.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.800]   I mean, I, you know, if I check in a piece of code, it breaks Bank of America's, you
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.720]   know, financial transaction system.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:23.640]   I'm not going to get sued.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.320]   My company is going to get sued.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:31.760]   So here's the point, commissioners Vivian Redding and Maglena Kuneva say that consumers have
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.840]   protection for physical product failings.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:39.160]   You know, if you have buy a tire and the tire fails, you can sue the manufacturer.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.320]   Why shouldn't software makers, you know, be liable in the same way?
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:45.080]   Well, I have to ask you data, Laura.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:51.520]   I mean, sometimes I feel like the EU commissioners are very anti business.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.240]   Is that something typically European or I mean, here in America, business rules.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.240]   Doesn't it?
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.520]   Yeah, well, I suppose it depends.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.520]   Like I work as an IT manager.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:07.320]   So I've got things that I need to make sure that they're reliable, particularly like protection,
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.200]   security and antivirus.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:16.080]   And if those folks don't live up their expectation, my manager director would have a kidding
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.080]   canary.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.800]   And he wants to point the finger at somebody.
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:24.320]   And I think that's the problem is that people who are responsible for this need to be able
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:28.640]   to point the finger at someone and there has to be some sort of consumer protection,
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:36.560]   but whether it be consumer or business protection, you know, I don't think it's easy just to
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:42.840]   kind of let this go because, you know, particularly with antivirus software, like where we protected
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.720]   for with free antivirus software.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.640]   We all know that if we download every G free, for example, the stick around our machines,
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:54.280]   it's not going to be as resilient as North America.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:44:00.280]   The BSA director of public policy Francisco, Mignon said, unlike tangible goods, creators
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:04.920]   of digital content cannot predict with a high degree of certainty, both the products
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.400]   anticipated uses and its potential performance.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.680]   He says, we shouldn't be held to the same standards as a toaster is.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.560]   You know what you're going to do with a toaster software could be used in a variety of situations.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.560]   You know what?
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.000]   When you build a car, you have a, you know, if you drive it off road, you know, that's
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.240]   kind of they're saying, well, that's not what you're off the hook.
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:31.560]   And in many ways, there's on a PC, there might be 20 or 30 different variations of what that
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.440]   software has to run against.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:37.280]   I tell you, I don't think this maybe would hurt commercial software.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.920]   You know, Microsoft just, you know, this is their business, but it's going to kill open
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920]   source software.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:44.880]   If you're an, and by the way, they want it to extend open source software as well.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:49.480]   If you're an open source developer and you know you could be sued if somebody uses your
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.080]   code and has a problem, you're not going to make, you're not going to make your code
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:54.080]   available.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:59.240]   So I think the unintended consequence of this, I mean, I agree, consumers should be protected,
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:02.200]   but the unintended consequence of this is to kill open source software.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:06.440]   And I don't think the EU commissioners are aware of that at all.
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.440]   Do you agree, Datalore?
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.080]   Yes, I would have to agree with that.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:16.000]   But at the end of the day, like it's really what you pay for.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.280]   If you get something free, you're not going to expect it to be, to be that resilient.
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.280]   You know what I mean?
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:27.280]   At the end of the day, it's more about the paid for software to suffer you depend on.
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:31.600]   Let's say if you go open up and install your machine and it dies, fair enough.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.560]   You know, you can start to explain.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.000]   You're able to take control of it for software.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.560]   I guess a court would recognize that too, right?
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.000]   Would say, well, look, you didn't pay for it.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.440]   What do you expect?
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:43.000]   You can't sue the developer here.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:47.560]   Although they explicitly say this, we want this to cover open source software.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.560]   Hey, great subject.
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.080]   I'm glad you brought that update, Alor.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:51.640]   That's a very interesting point.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:55.000]   I think, unfortunately, we miss a lot of stories out of Europe.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.680]   We tend to be a little bit US-centric because it was originally a US-only podcast.
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:04.680]   But I'm glad that we have listeners in Dublin and really appreciate your being here.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.520]   I'll do my best for you, Leo.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.520]   No worries.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:08.520]   Thank you, Datalore.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.520]   Take care.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:10.520]   I think we're going to have to...
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.520]   All right, take care.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:12.520]   We're going to have to wrap this up.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:15.080]   We have many, many, many, many, many, many more callers, but we really have made this the
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.040]   longest twit in history.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:18.680]   But it's a volunteer twit.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.680]   It should be longer.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:20.680]   Exactly.
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:26.160]   Alex Lindsey is at the Pixelcore.tv is where the podcasts live soon to be a Squarespace
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.160]   site.
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.680]   Pixelcore.com is the place to find out about his guild of multimedia artists, the kind
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:34.400]   of people who make Star Trek possible.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:35.560]   Alex, always great to have you.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.240]   We'll see you on Mac Break Weekly on Tuesday.
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.240]   Two days.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:39.800]   In just a couple of days.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.080]   And I really want to thank you for coming up and leaping into the breach, Brian Daniel
