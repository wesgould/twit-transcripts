[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.280]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, the show that covers all
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.320]   the week's tech news.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320]   And we've got a great cast of characters.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.480]   We're giving John C. Devorak off for a turkey day.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.440]   But we've got some great people in studio with us
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.720]   to celebrate, starting with Dwight Silverman from the Houston
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.800]   Chronicle, a regular on the show, and always a welcome guest.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.120]   Hey, Dwight.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.240]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.920]   Good to see you again.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.880]   Good to be here.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.960]   Also, a rare visit from Mr. Paul Thorett,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.040]   who is the host of Windows Weekly.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.200]   I've broken my blockage of this--
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   Yes.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.400]   Well, you were banned after a while.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.960]   But I think so long.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.920]   Enough time has gone by.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.040]   Who's my defensive vista three years ago, wasn't it?
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   Yes, it was.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.120]   No, no, actually, your wife asked me to have you on to try
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.360]   to break the hold of modern warfare, too.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.720]   I don't know if it's going to succeed.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.760]   But I have completed the multiplayer.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.080]   Consider this an intervention.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.720]   You can't complete the multiplayer.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.280]   I agree.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.320]   And I'm going to prove that--
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.920]   I'm going to prove that contention correct.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.360]   I'm really thrilled to get Jerry Pournell back.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.320]   The last time Jerry was on, he was undergoing treatments
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.360]   that caused his voice to be pretty gravelly
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.800]   and make a difficult for him to talk.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.000]   And Jerry's better and feisty.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.120]   And we're so glad to have you back on, Jerry.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.320]   Yes, I feel a lot better.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.120]   50,000 rads of hard radiation will
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.920]   do strange things to your memory and your voice and other things.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.600]   But it also does fatal things to the cancer.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   So that's the good news.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.400]   And the treatment was successful, then.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.800]   Barry, I have no cancer whatsoever.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.040]   I have some residual effects from radiation damage.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.520]   But they mostly have to do with very short-term memory.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.120]   Well, I couldn't--
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.240]   And not much of that.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.720]   I speak for all of us saying we couldn't be happier.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.840]   I have to say, worried.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.160]   And so we're really glad that you're back and better.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.440]   That's great.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.880]   Sure.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.960]   We were-- with the reason you're here, Jerry, well,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.840]   there are several reasons.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.240]   But one is that Audible has released two of your classics.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.040]   Swarms was the only one for a long time.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.720]   And now the MotenGod's Eye and Lucifer's Hammer
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.200]   are both on Audible.com.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.040]   And I've been reading-- I am ashamed to admit I never read.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.360]   Well, if I'm a pander to Jerry, two of the greatest books
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.320]   I've ever written.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.480]   Well, I'm going to agree with you.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I mean, I'm just--
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   No, I'm just--
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I'm just crazy.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.920]   In fact, there are a handful of books
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   that I can say probably--
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.680]   I can say probably--
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.200]   There are a handful of books that I can say probably contributed
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.640]   to me wanting to be a writer and certainly
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.320]   to a passion for science fiction.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.800]   And Lucifer's Hammer is one of them.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.560]   Sure.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.000]   Oh, thank you.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.280]   Well, that was, in fact, I think the conversation Paul
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.520]   and I had was how much you and your column
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.800]   in Bite Magazine for many years influenced us.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.440]   Yeah, discovering that Jerry wrote for Bite
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.920]   was a watershed moment.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.200]   No, I'm serious because much--
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.480]   most computer-- all computer writing to that date
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.800]   and most since has been very dry and interesting and terrible.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.080]   No, I mean, it had personality.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.160]   You could tell it was a real person having real problems.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.040]   Right, right.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.200]   Well, when I got into Bite Magazine
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.960]   was one of the early computer magazines.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.760]   This is CPMS 100 days.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.000]   And the most Bite articles were done
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.120]   by professors of computer science,
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.400]   whom the editors tried to hammer the stuff
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.040]   into something readable.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.320]   And sometimes they managed it and sometimes they didn't.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.920]   So when I talked to Carl and he said, well, why don't you
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.040]   try seeing what you can do with it?
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.600]   They didn't have to edit me.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.080]   Whether or not what I had to say was useful,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.160]   it certainly was going to need editing
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.520]   if you know what I mean.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I tried to keep it useful in the sense of here's
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.160]   what I'm doing to try to use these darn full machines,
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.280]   which in those days you rewrite the bios in the typical way
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.040]   when you've got a new machine.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.760]   So you do an interface with CPM in order
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.720]   to be able to use electric pencil.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   Wow.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.280]   I have to say--
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   Go ahead, Jerry.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.160]   I paid $12,000 for that first machine,
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.960]   which is now by the way on display in the Smithsonian.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.840]   Is it?
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.560]   Literally, yeah.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.040]   If you go to the hall of computing
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.400]   in the Museum of American History,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.560]   the third from-- there's an old M.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.000]   Sa Paddle wheel.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.160]   There's a course in Altair.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.560]   And the third one is Old Ezekiel, my old Z80,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.080]   that was the machine I wrote all those columns on.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   Wow.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.680]   And wrote the first novel anybody ever
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.280]   wrote using a computer to write a novel.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.080]   So--
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.880]   Really, which novel was that?
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.640]   We don't remember.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.360]   It was--
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.680]   It wasn't--
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.600]   Mote was finished as a novel, but it wasn't written on.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.240]   Mote was written on a typewriter.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.840]   Wow.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.360]   So it was probably inferno and a couple
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.400]   of my individual ones.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.840]   And of course, by that time I was writing the columns on it.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.320]   And I was in Science Editor of Galaxy.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.880]   So those columns got put together into a book called
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.440]   A Stepfather Out.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.960]   Nobody's quite sure which one.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.800]   And I didn't save the stuff.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.920]   Now that they exist only on 8-inch floppy disk, 64K.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.000]   Imagine 64K on your math storage device.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.880]   You're going to have to go to the Smithsonian just
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.800]   to read the floppies.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.160]   Baro is Ezekiel back.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.560]   Yeah, I was thinking that.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.520]   Well, I woke him up at the Smithsonian
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.080]   so he'd know where he was.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.160]   Oh, that's so neat.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.040]   That was one of the things I always loved about the KS
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.600]   manner column.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.880]   They all had names.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.960]   I loved that.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.600]   Still do.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.240]   And Larry Niven stuff.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   You were almost like tech support for Larry Niven.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.160]   Well, Larry's answer to the computer revolution
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.120]   was to get an exact copy of mine.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.320]   In fact, he being a doheny millionaire, he got two.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.840]   That way he had a spare.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.520]   A spare.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.440]   That was back when there were $12,000 for the darn--
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.400]   of which six was the Diablo printer, which
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   was essentially a select trick with electronic printing.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.000]   It could print 1,200 characters a minute.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.640]   Wow.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.480]   And probably pretty noisy doing it.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.680]   I was going to say, and cause earthquakes in California.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.600]   Well, it took all night to print a book.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.120]   And of course, it printed on fan folded paper.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.360]   And you had to tear the--
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.600]   I brought the kids to tear the ears off the paper.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.680]   So to burst and decolate.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.800]   Wow.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.440]   That's one of my favorite phrases.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.880]   Burst and decolate.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.040]   You know, I don't think I ever heard that before.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.200]   That's a great--
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.360]   bursting is taken off the ears.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.040]   And decolating, of course, is tearing it up
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.120]   and putting it--
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.520]   recolating, ineffectively.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.240]   Recolating, but I wish I'd said that.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.440]   And probably in a couple hours, I will have.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.320]   You can steal it.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.600]   I'll give it to you.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.640]   It's the least I can do.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.320]   So tech news, there's a lot to talk about.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.720]   Of course, this is Black Friday, or we're
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.240]   post Black Friday, and tomorrow's Cyber Monday a day
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.600]   that I think a lot of--
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.640]   if you look at the numbers, it's pretty obvious.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.880]   It was just made up by some journalist somewhere.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.320]   He had to make up the idea that there's
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.720]   some magic, special magic on Monday.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.640]   The theory being that people go back to work and use the--
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   Fast connection.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.840]   The only computer they have, the one at work.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.920]   It must be from 1988.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.520]   They came up with this Cyber Monday.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.240]   I mean, use the fast computer and the fast connection at work.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.360]   I think most people have faster connections
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.200]   and certainly have faster computers at home these days.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.800]   In your coverage of Black Friday and Cyber Monday,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.120]   Dwight, any trends you saw?
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.000]   Well, one of the things that I thought was interesting
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.200]   was that the Black Friday, the brick and mortar stores,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.360]   they actually did a lot better.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.560]   I think the numbers that I saw, they actually did like 3%
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.280]   improvement over last year, which in a down economy
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.400]   is pretty good.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.840]   And that the online sales were just up a little bit more.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.480]   But when people were buying online,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.440]   the numbers I saw, they were buying bigger things.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.160]   They were buying more expensive things online.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.000]   And maybe they were just buying Macs.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.840]   But it strikes me that I agree with you.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   I think Cyber Monday is kind of bogus.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.480]   It is bogus.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.240]   It is by now anyway.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:03.920]   Right.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.400]   Right.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.680]   And although I think that there are a lot of people
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.000]   who have probably faster connections, particularly
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   if they-- there are people now who
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.360]   have automobile mechanics of an internet connection,
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.440]   who may not necessarily be able to afford a really fast
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.280]   connection at home.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.720]   So there's probably a little bit of that type of thing
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.960]   demographically.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.480]   But the majority of people I think just shop at home
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.200]   and probably shop on--
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.640]   over the weekend, I think that probably if you take a look
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.360]   at numbers that will come out Monday for the whole weekend,
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.000]   I think there's probably a lot of it that happens
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.280]   on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.680]   It seemed like last Black Friday.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.640]   I mean, with such a zoo, somebody got killed at Walmart.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.080]   This one is kind of completely uneventful compared to it.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.920]   I know why.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.680]   Why?
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.920]   They were home playing Call of Duty.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.640]   We know that's where Paul was.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.120]   Wait a minute, Paul, you have a tradition,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.080]   don't you, going to Best Buy at 4 in the morning?
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.680]   Yeah, and I did not do it this year.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.160]   Well, see, there you go.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.840]   And what were you doing instead?
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.000]   Well, sleeping at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.280]   But yeah, I did some Call of Duty.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.160]   You can do all this stuff online now.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.960]   In fact, I actually did some Christmas shopping
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.240]   on my iPhone this year.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.800]   Wow.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.640]   So what did your world has changed?
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.360]   How do you-- I don't want to be afraid to say it.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.880]   Did you use the Amazon app?
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.360]   What did you--
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.880]   I did, yeah.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.280]   It was-- and by the way--
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.720]   I will say this, it was a book book, like an actual book,
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.560]   a physical paper--
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.600]   No, why?
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.520]   Why?
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.600]   The only way that this book comes.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.240]   Jerry, what do you think of these ebook readers, Jerry?
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.520]   Are you a fan of the kind of--
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.480]   Well, they're beginning to get--
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.720]   I think the whole publishing world
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.000]   is changing in ways that we can't even figure out.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.760]   It will not be very long, I think,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.200]   especially with these ebook readers being sold.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:04.160]   That payment for somebody's book or work is optional.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.360]   You're not going to enforce it with by law,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.480]   because right now the Kindle format,
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.160]   you have to buy something from Amazon
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.080]   to get it on a Kindle.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.040]   But even that's not true anymore.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.920]   No, you can email your Kindle, yeah.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.280]   Yeah, you can email yourself.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.640]   They used to do it for a dime.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.880]   Now I understand it's $0.15 a megabyte or something.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.800]   That's interesting.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.760]   Some number like that.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.080]   Yeah, they just raised the price.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.760]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.920]   Almost anything anybody ever wrote
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.160]   is available somewhere online, if you really
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.720]   wanted to go about finding it.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.400]   Well, not always legally.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.280]   Oh, that's what I mean.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.960]   Pirate editions are available for almost everything.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   And at that point, law and copyright
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.520]   are not the primary.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.800]   Right now, I think most readers think
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.440]   they don't want to do the author.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.240]   And they don't mind paying because they
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.000]   think that the creator of the artist actually gets the money.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.360]   That's not true with records, because it got built into the DMCA
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.320]   in that famous late night edition by staffer who later became
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.960]   a vice president of RIAA.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.280]   That the default in the contract was that the publisher
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.560]   gets all the money.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.880]   So music fans don't really think they're
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.720]   stealing from the artist.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.120]   And they don't like the publishers.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.800]   I think we're right.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.640]   I don't think you have the same animosity towards book
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.080]   publishers.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.160]   And you certainly, I think people have a real affinity
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.120]   for book authors.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.040]   Maybe it's a more intimate relationship,
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.080]   because it lasts longer.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.560]   I don't know.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.280]   But I think you're right.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.320]   I think they care more about the author.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.200]   And I think that relationship's important to preserve.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:00.520]   And as Kendall's and various who just Amazon just came up with.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.000]   Barnes and Noble has them.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.520]   The Nooki--
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.640]   The Nooki reader.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.480]   Nooki book.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.520]   And Nooki book.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.200]   There's Sony One, which has been pretty good for a long time.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.640]   Some of my fans got together and bought me
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.160]   one when they first came out.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.720]   And they engraved with my name on it, which is nice.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   And it's nice.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.120]   But they didn't take off until recently.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.360]   But nowadays with these big price
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:32.880]   wars going on and Amazon selling books that are $27 for $9.95
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.360]   if you buy it on the Kindle.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.760]   And by the way, Amazon is paying the full royalty of a $27 book
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.920]   to the author for that $9.95.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.240]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.960]   Yeah, isn't it?
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.000]   They lose money on everyone else's sales.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.880]   Do they get a cut--
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.320]   the publisher gets the same cut too?
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.360]   Or is it a cut rate because it's an e-book?
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.160]   Publisher gets the same amount.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.440]   Publishers basically sell books for half the cover price.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.200]   And that's the same for an e-book or a printed book.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.560]   And printed books.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.160]   Now, some people are getting different arrangements, maybe.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.720]   But the standard is still--
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.200]   authors get a percent of the cover price.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.120]   Typically 10%.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.360]   Stephen King gets a little more.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.920]   Some authors and new authors get like 8.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.600]   But it's between 8 and 15.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.160]   And that's percentage of the cover price,
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.760]   not a percentage of receipts or anything like that
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.360]   the way the movie houses do.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.120]   So the result is that to have all of these deep discounts
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.960]   in books is a very expensive proposition.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.120]   And best sellers often don't make as much money
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.280]   as you'd think simply because in order
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.160]   to get people in the store, they discount best sellers down
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.480]   to zip.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.840]   The author still gets the money, but nobody else does.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.920]   It's amazing.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.340]   Well, we're going to-- actually, the price
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.480]   war is heated up considerably.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.400]   We're going to talk about in just a second Amazon and Walmart
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   at each other's throats.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   Microsoft and Google at each other's throats.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   The online--
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.240]   It's the holiday season.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.280]   It's the holiday season, kids.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.400]   Before we do the good cheer.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.800]   Before we do that, I want to mention my good friends.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.920]   At Citrix, I know Jerry knows Citrix.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.280]   I go way back with them since the good old days with Ed
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.040]   Jakobuchi.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   And they made such an amazing remote access product.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.880]   The Microsoft promptly licensed it
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.720]   and made it their remote access product.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.200]   They also have a product that makes it very easy for you
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.640]   to meet online.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.400]   And that's called Go To Meeting.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.560]   And when I say easy, I mean easy.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.440]   Go to Meeting.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.560]   You could try it right now for free for the next month
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.480]   and see how simple it is to save money on your business
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:44.760]   meetings.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.080]   Go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.920]   According to American Express, the average cost
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.600]   of a business trip these days is $1,000 when
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.000]   you add up the plane fare, the hotel, the meals, the per diem,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.240]   the cab fare.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.800]   Not to mention the stress of taking your shoes off
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.440]   in the security line and getting the middle seat.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.360]   Forget it.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.600]   $49 a month.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.320]   Unlimited meetings as long as you want, as often as you want.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.040]   And man, I tell you, these are more engaging, more fun,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.560]   more interesting because they're seeing your computer screen
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.440]   on their desktop.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.760]   So you're showing them the PowerPoint.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.160]   You're showing them the drawings.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.360]   You're working with them.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.920]   Man, if you and Larry had had that when you were writing
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.520]   the books, imagine the collaboration.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.080]   I'll write a sentence.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:24.560]   You write a sentence.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.120]   I write a sentence.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.480]   You write a sentence.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   That doesn't work.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.600]   No, I bet it doesn't.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.160]   We tried to do that.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.520]   We tried to do a book on Twitter around Robin with Tom
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.760]   Merritt and Demali Wood have buzzed out loud in me.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.280]   And what was happened is it tug of war.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.680]   I'd have an idea and I'd write a line
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.960]   and they'd pull it in a different direction.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.560]   I'd pull it back.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.280]   It was terrible.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.360]   Worst-man-nurse novel you ever read.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.320]   And I take full credit for how bad it was.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   Not quite.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.480]   I think it came in the stranger way.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:52.920]   OK.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.040]   There are words.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.840]   I agree.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.600]   You're here first, folks.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.000]   Let me just say, go to meaning.com/twit.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.720]   Go there right now.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.000]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.040]   We know you're going to love it.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.200]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.600]   You know, the government could have saved a lot of money
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.520]   if they'd used go to meeting a couple of weeks ago.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:21.320]   They paid for a number of us to go back to Tyson's corner
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.160]   of Virginia, if that means anything to you.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.560]   It's pretty near McLean.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.560]   At SAIS sponsored the meeting.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.920]   It was a conference.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.400]   I mean, well, they put it on.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.880]   Who paid for it is, let's say, a government agency.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.400]   Inter-- a three-letter agency, no doubt.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.280]   Well, a government agency.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.160]   And they had a bunch of people, including three Nobel Prize
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.360]   winners, plus me and a couple of other science fiction
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   people to comment on this.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.400]   On this subject, we sat around and talked about it all day.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   But you know, it was just talking heads at a table,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.880]   plus some PowerPoint presentation.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.960]   Look at what we do here.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.880]   And easily done, right?
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.440]   What we're doing.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.760]   But of course, this way, you and the other taxpayers
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.200]   got to pay for me to go back to Washington,
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.800]   where I could see my grandchildren.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.880]   Well, I'm glad to do it.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.800]   Glad to do that, Jerry.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.000]   What was the topic of conversation, if I can ask?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.840]   It had to do with enhancement.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.200]   Human enhancement.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.840]   Wow.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.560]   You have said, yes, one of the people who was there,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.240]   I'll give you some example.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.760]   You remember bubble boys that don't exist anymore, right?
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.080]   You never hear of them anymore.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.080]   They do.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.200]   Not at states.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.880]   And the reason for it is because a man named Friedman,
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.440]   down at the University of California, San Diego,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.280]   and his colleagues, came up with a technique.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.720]   They discovered that it's a gene deficiency,
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.360]   this immune deficiency at birth.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.760]   For those who don't know, a bubble boy was a kid who
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.920]   has no immune system whatsoever at birth.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.720]   And they raised some of them, literally, in a plastic bubble.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.200]   They kept them separated from the outside world
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.760]   so they couldn't get infected.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.120]   Of course, that makes for a very strange life.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.400]   And I guess they did a movie about one, a boy
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.640]   where he finally died at age 18 or something.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.280]   But he had essentially never been touched by a human being
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.880]   in most of his life, except through a plastic barrier.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.360]   You don't hear those anymore.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.440]   That turns out to be a gene deficiency.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.360]   And they had developed a technique
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.280]   whereby you take a virus.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.160]   You infect it with that gene.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.640]   Now you take that gene, that gene carrying virus,
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.400]   and inject it into a human being.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.560]   It goes in and infects him and infects the bone marrow.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.240]   And the bone marrow now starts producing
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.120]   non-defective blood cells.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.440]   And what do you know?
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.320]   No more bubble.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.960]   Wow.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.400]   I had no idea.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:05.080]   And there are about 40 kids, a lot, of whom some 32
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.000]   are still alive having been treated by this,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.760]   and are just normal children.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.200]   You don't know that they were born to be bubble boys.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.160]   Well, this chap who invented that was there.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.480]   Now imagine that technique when we're
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.680]   thinking of other kinds of enhancements.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.960]   Other genes to make people who have better vision, stronger,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.480]   smarter.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.320]   Now those are not generally single-gene controlled things.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.600]   But there are a bunch of things, the inhuman behavior,
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.600]   that are, in fact, single-gene controlled.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.040]   There is no way reason why they can't be enhanced at birth
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.000]   by injecting this.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.880]   I have to ask, is it military application that there,
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.720]   since it was a government agency?
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.720]   I think a concern, you have people
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.000]   who are interested in maybe trying it.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.880]   But also there is some concern about how to inject
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.520]   if somebody else is doing it.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.760]   I love it that they brought in science fiction authors.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.720]   Because all of us love science fiction.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.880]   I probably everybody listens to show love science fiction.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.160]   And it's pretty obvious.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.320]   And I've talked to a lot of scientists that--
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.920]   great many, if not most, scientists--
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.280]   were heavily influenced by sci-fi
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   and focused their research on areas
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.520]   that science fiction inspired them to study, which
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.280]   is why, in so many ways, modern scientific advances
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.240]   parallel what you guys were writing about decades earlier.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.800]   When you get around to listening to the molten gods,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.160]   I pay attention to the pocket computer.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.400]   I wrote that in 1972.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.120]   And we had what amounted to--
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.760]   well, an iPhone does most of what it says in there.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.040]   But of course, we had to set that a long way away.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.800]   Because even in 1972, nobody thought
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.480]   you would be able to-- that I would live to see--
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.480]   is it amazing--
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.040]   to be carrying a pocket computer like we have in the story.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.400]   Yeah, we were--
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   so Jerry--
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.720]   so Jerry is a-- is it a case of the chicken of the egg,
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.560]   you know, Arthur C. Clark came up in theory,
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.520]   came up with the idea for satellites.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.360]   And I've talked to the guys at Palm,
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.640]   who did the original Palm pilot, who
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.040]   said they specifically designed their device, which
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.760]   was kind of the precursor of things like the iPhone,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.960]   PDAs, to look like the communicator and Star Trek.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.880]   That's what they wanted to do.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.360]   And on the--
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.480]   And Gene basically got that out of molten god die.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:35.960]   Right.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.460]   Right.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.980]   So which comes first?
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.580]   Is it-- you know, the science fiction writers usually
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.940]   come up with what the scientists invent?
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.260]   Well, Al Ron Hubbard would have said so first you have to have
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.420]   somebody dream and dream.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.180]   And then they get to work.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.580]   Whether that's true or not, I suspect that Michael Faraday
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.340]   never wrote any--
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:57.840]   No.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.380]   --never read any science fiction.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.380]   No.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.540]   Nor, I guess, did Einstein.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.180]   But a great number of--
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.260]   here I did, as an example.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.740]   Here I was a fan of H.G. Wells and Bern.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:15.100]   And many-- you got a minute.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.100]   I'll tell you a story.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.100]   Sure.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.340]   Got nothing at the time.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.640]   That the mariner landed on--
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.140]   I'm sorry, the Viking landed on Mars.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.740]   First, soft landed vehicle on Mars, right?
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.140]   We had got a bunch of science fiction writers
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.500]   invited to JPL as press.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.980]   In my case, I was press.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.780]   I was editor of science editor of Galaxy magazine.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.260]   And I also was a science correspondent
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.900]   for the National Catholic Press, which
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.020]   was like 5 million circulation.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.380]   But Mr. Heinlein was there as a science fiction writer
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.260]   but he had a press badge.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.780]   Well, about an hour or so before the landing, some PR guy
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.100]   said the place is too crowded.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.660]   Let's get everybody out of here who
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.940]   doesn't have a real press credential.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.940]   And they will start with Robert Heinlein.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.140]   Out.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.780]   So Robert starts to try jing out.
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.700]   And I say, Robert, that's terrible.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.740]   They can't do that too.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.780]   And he said, I'll gerry, don't worry about it.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.900]   There's going to be cameras up in the cafeteria.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.580]   So he went out and I started following.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.380]   And somebody asked me, where are you going?
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.060]   And I said, they're telling Mr. Heinlein he can't stay here.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.100]   And I'm not going to stay thinking.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.100]   Before it was over half the science press call
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.940]   was following us up the hill to the cafeteria.
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.580]   They brought the cameras.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.980]   And when the Viking actually landed,
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:42.380]   instead of the camera being on the governor who had come down
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:47.540]   to Jerry Brown had come down to be the big man when it landed,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.140]   nobody was paying any attention to him.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.260]   They were all trying to interview Robert Heinlein
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.780]   on what it felt like to see the first landing on Mars.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.780]   Love it.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:02.660]   I guess we-- and a bunch of the project scientists were up there
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.980]   too, and they wanted to talk to Robert and said,
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.260]   you know, we got into this business because of guys like you.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.260]   So there is something to that.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:17.260]   I guess we have some influence in showing kids that maybe,
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.340]   maybe if you spend the time to learn calculus,
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.700]   it'll do you some good?
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.700]   Yep.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.340]   I keep trying to explain that to my kids,
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.100]   but it's not working.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:32.460]   Have you seen the manga book on calculus?
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.420]   No, that sounds good though.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.420]   I'd like to get that.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.820]   I think Henry would be impressed.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.580]   It is.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.820]   There is a manga book of calculus,
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.060]   and you'd think, that has got to be the dumbest idea.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:42.460]   I've ever heard it.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.260]   I'm about to review it from my column.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.300]   I like it.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.260]   I like it a lot.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.540]   And there is also a head first physics book.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.980]   Those head first books are quite good.
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.460]   I like the head first books.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.460]   This is both. They're both from O'Reilly.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.060]   We're actually, I'm sorry.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.180]   No start.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.260]   I can actually hold one of them up.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:00.940]   Probably.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.100]   I've got them around here.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.740]   As I say, they're in my review stack.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:12.580]   But the, and there is also the head first here.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.140]   I'll get it.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.500]   Careful.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.140]   Head first statistics.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:17.940]   That I have.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.900]   I got that for my daughter when she was taking statistics.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.140]   It was excellent.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.180]   It is excellent.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.340]   You can, and it's sound.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.580]   I mean, I have a master's in experimental statistics,
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.860]   so I'm competent to review the book.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.740]   And it's quite sound.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.460]   And I would wish I'd had it instead of the book
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:40.500]   I had in statistics when I had to take calculus of statistics.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.260]   So probabilities.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.260]   So yeah.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.260]   Nothing worse than that.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.820]   So a lot of stuff like that.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:46.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.140]   We're learning a little bit about how to make stuff more
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.620]   interesting.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.060]   Thank goodness.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.900]   Hey, get some trouble.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.220]   Go ahead.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.620]   Kids are more and more going into social sciences.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.740]   And of course, if you really want to make money,
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.260]   you learn how to move money around in circles
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.220]   and you don't create anything.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.100]   You just take a percentage as it moves past your hand.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.540]   And you're the smartest guy in the room.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:15.740]   And that, I think, is probably not the best course
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.980]   in the future.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.540]   Yeah, I often wonder that the financial crisis
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.260]   that we're going through, which is partly created
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.500]   by these crazy derivatives created by math geniuses who,
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.540]   instead of using their MIT degrees to make a difference
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.940]   in the world, used it to create bizarre financial instruments.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.940]   I wonder how much we-- not merely money and our economic crisis,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.860]   but I wish we lost from the brain drain to Wall Street
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.260]   and some of the smartest mathematicians.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.660]   That's where they went, because that's where the money was.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.820]   Walmart and Amazon in a fight, not just over books.
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.980]   You mentioned Jerry the price cutting on books.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.500]   But now, according to an article in The New York Times
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:01.340]   from a couple of days ago, it's going to DVDs, toys.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.460]   Last Wednesday, Walmart dropped the price of the Hasbro Easy
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.780]   Bake Oven, which we all grew up with.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.940]   Even Jerry, you probably had a Hasbro Easy Bake when you were--
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.180]   they dropped the price to $17 from $28 Amazon, which
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:20.380]   had been charging $28, dropped it to $18.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.420]   And I'm sure they're losing money in a lot of these things.
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.060]   Yeah, but it's like--
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.980]   Are we sure are on the books?
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.940]   Go ahead.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.860]   They just want to get people into the stores, yeah.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.620]   Right.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.060]   So it's a loss leader.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.740]   Do you think that Amazon is a real threat
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.860]   to a brick and mortar store like Walmart?
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.260]   Paul, Paul, what do you think?
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.220]   Yeah, I think that--
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.940]   We're already seeing the disappearance of the small bookstores.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.180]   Well, I should say the medium-sized bookstores.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.100]   The bookstores that fall--
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.540]   The independents are dying.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.620]   Yeah, they're dying.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.380]   Yeah, so some of the real small mom and pop stuff--
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.380]   you see some of that in small towns and so forth.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.580]   And then you see borders in Barnes and Noble.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.860]   But these mall bookstores are all pretty much gone.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.900]   They've all been swallowed up.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:11.260]   And they're being shut down by borders in Barnes and Noble now.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.580]   Yeah, it's as cutthroat as any other industry.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.260]   Barnes and Noble is a company that has their own imprint.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.020]   They publish their own books.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.740]   That's kind of a scary thing in some ways.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.580]   And then Amazon, of course, as Jerry mentioned earlier,
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.220]   is selling their Kindle books to the loss in many cases.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.380]   They're trying to create this platform.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.780]   So they're willing to take a loss.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.060]   And they have enough money to make it happen.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.260]   So yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.140]   I think Walmart and Amazon may ultimately
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.380]   be the two bookstores that are left.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:40.980]   That's sad.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.340]   Walmart offered a $15 gift card with the purchase
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.500]   of Modern Warfare 2.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.900]   Amazon matched it.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.660]   That's awesome.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.660]   Awesome.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.340]   Another wrong with that.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.580]   Walmart and Amazon offered--
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.300]   --rehealing the Xbox 360 for $199.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.940]   Then threw in $100 gift card.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.300]   Now they're offering the Palm Pixie phone for $175 off
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.420]   suggested retail $30 for the phone.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.500]   Well, I point out that if you live in California,
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.340]   Amazon starts with a 10% advantage to begin with
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.900]   because it don't sales tax.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.340]   That's right.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.580]   I don't know how long that'll last.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.580]   I know that.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.380]   That's true in Texas, too.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.980]   Well, California would love to change that.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:23.220]   But so far, they haven't been able to do it.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.140]   And the feds don't really--
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.180]   you have to get it passed Congress.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.420]   And there are some fairly powerful lobbies involved there.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.700]   So it will be interesting to see what happens.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.340]   But you start with a 10% advantage.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.220]   How many dry good stores do you see nowadays?
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.020]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.220]   Hardware stores out of business.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.220]   Cleaned up.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.300]   Yeah, there are a few hardware stores
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.660]   because of the technical excellence of the clerks.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.980]   And it's really the only way they stay open is you've got
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.340]   clerks who actually know where to find things and what
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.180]   thing you need to unstop your drain and that sort of thing.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.740]   I'm with you.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.380]   But our local independent bookstore, I keep telling them,
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.900]   you're competing against Amazon.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.020]   You better have service.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.580]   You better make it easy to find a book.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.140]   You better be able to recommend stuff
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.020]   because you're competing against somebody who's
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.260]   going to undercut you every step of the way.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.260]   It does not mean anything.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.140]   You may have thought of one of the horrible consequences of
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.220]   what's happening with the bookstore concentrations.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.700]   Every time a big find in Noble or one of those book warehouses
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:31.540]   opened, it's good for writers because they have lots of backlist.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.420]   You remember when the industry was dominated by Beel
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.460]   Alton and they were mostly in the malls and it was small
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:44.740]   stores so they didn't have many books and almost no backlist.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.540]   Well, those stores are all going away.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.860]   Thank God those were awful.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.140]   You think so, but think about this.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.060]   That was the recruiting ground.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.100]   If you go to Barnes and Noble, you went there to buy a book.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.540]   If you went to Fashion Square Mall, you probably didn't go
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.900]   there to buy a book, but you might see a book in the window
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.860]   and decide to buy one.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.420]   Nowadays, we don't have recruiting grounds for non-readers
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.580]   anymore.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.460]   People who are non-readers never get to bookstores.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.020]   They never see one.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.860]   Very interesting.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.180]   That's a really good point.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.620]   Plus, the few chances they have to read are basically the
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:27.660]   reading versions of soundbites, blogs or email or whatever.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:34.260]   The very short form text, not long form stories.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.820]   The amount of steps that tends to run the essays and fairly
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.980]   all text, but much longer and so it's a, I try to stay at a
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.260]   higher intellectual plane, which is one reason why I don't
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.460]   have blogging on the site.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.140]   I don't know.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.380]   Seems to work.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:56.260]   Well, the one exception to the idea of going to websites and
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.860]   things like Amazon.com, keeping you from having a
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.100]   serendipity discovery, is that Amazon has that very cool
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.420]   feature that recommends things to you.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.620]   If you've bought any books at all or even browsed any books at
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.860]   all, when you first go to the Amazon homepage, it gives you
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.580]   some recommendations.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.900]   That's probably about the best way that you could do it.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.060]   At least, getting away, that's kind of the same thing as the
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.700]   window and the mall.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.740]   The one thing I'm really interested in is the online
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.980]   battle between Amazon and Walmart.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.620]   Walmart wasn't just matching stuff in their brick and
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.260]   mortar stores, they were matching stuff online.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.780]   I wonder if any of these companies don't have scripts that
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.340]   say Walmart watches what a price is on Amazon.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:39.740]   Why not?
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:40.260]   Automated.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.940]   Immediately changes it.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.020]   It tweaks it.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.940]   I mean, you could almost have an eBay situation where you bid
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.940]   things down as a result of the scripts competing with each
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.780]   other.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.660]   That would be good.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.820]   Here's a shocking story.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.620]   Half the money spent at retail on desktop computers in
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.300]   October.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.540]   You're not going to like this, Paul, went to Macintosh.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.500]   What's this?
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.460]   Paul put down modern warfare.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.700]   That's not desktop.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.660]   No, it's desktops.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.580]   The Mac, US retail, desktop computer.
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.780]   I know I'm going to give you a chance, Paul, because I saw
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.340]   your tweet.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.620]   Actually, this is different from the operating system.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.580]   No, no, no.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.100]   You're talking about the amount of money people spend at
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.900]   retail, is that what you're talking about?
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.380]   According to the NPD, Mac, US retail desktop computer
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.780]   revenue, yes, you're right.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.820]   47%--
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.820]   Two things there.
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.340]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.260]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.260]   Up from 37%, up from 33% a year earlier.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:38.820]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.780]   So Macs are expensive, I think, is what we're finding out here.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:48.300]   I mean, when this quarter is all said and done, the Macintosh
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:54.460]   may amount to 8% or 9% of sales overall in the United States.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.100]   You did not like this computer world story, however, about
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.660]   Windows and Mac.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.180]   No, that's a different thing.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:35:59.860]   That's a different thing.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.700]   Because people always talk about market share, and they
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.740]   don't mean market share, and that drives me crazy.
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:09.340]   But as far as retail sales, I don't know.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.620]   NPD is actually very reliable.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.100]   And I know that from a Microsoft perspective, one of the
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.380]   conversations I've had with those guys is when NPD came out
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.060]   with numbers about things like iPod market share and so forth,
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.860]   I go back to Microsoft and say, what do you think about
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:23.860]   this?
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.500]   And they say, oh, yeah, we use these guys.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.260]   We trust these numbers.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.820]   But they're talking about revenue share.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.260]   When you're talking money, dollars.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.340]   They're not talking units sold.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.780]   I mean, two of the things that are occurring in this economy
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.700]   of ours, which are very interesting and completely
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.020]   at odds with each other, is that there are only two types
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.340]   of computers that are selling well in the United States.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.460]   Macs and netbooks.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.540]   Netbooks cost nothing, and Macs tend to be fairly expensive,
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.540]   typically more expensive than your average AC.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.860]   Like 10 netbooks for one Mac.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.500]   Yeah, actually, in some cases, you can't.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.340]   So this number is interesting.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.140]   I mean, I don't dispute it.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.340]   But I think that this just reinforces the fact that when
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.900]   you look at PC sales, PC sales this year will be down
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.060]   overall or down slightly, I would say.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.980]   Netbooks are up and Macs are up.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.340]   So this makes sense.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.820]   Macs cost more money.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.340]   So do you think that there are really two markets?
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:26.740]   There's the rich buyer who isn't price sensitive
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.500]   and is buying the Mac and then everybody else?
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   Well, sort of.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.580]   But Macs are high quality machines.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.460]   I mean, I'm not disparaging Macs.
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.580]   I mean, actually, one of the really smart things
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.140]   that Apple did, although this comes in retrospect.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.820]   I mean, when they started this campaign,
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.860]   I didn't think it was smart at all.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.300]   And I'm sure a lot of people didn't.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.180]   Their retail stores give people an opportunity
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.180]   to go in and look and play with these things.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.260]   And they can see what they're like.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.580]   And I think that makes a big difference.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.660]   Because when you go to a Best Buy,
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.100]   or well, they don't have computer space.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.220]   It's not a good experience.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220]   It's not a good experience.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.380]   Well, PCs are not a great experience in these stores
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.460]   because the people there don't typically care.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.660]   They're destroyed.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:09.380]   They don't work.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.340]   They're sitting there with a blue screen or whatever it is.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.980]   Apple stores are a great experience.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.660]   And most people, I think, who go into Apple stores
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.460]   are really coming at it from an iPod iPhone perspective.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.860]   But then they see the Macs, they think, oh, you know,
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.700]   these are great.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.700]   You know, and I, yeah, I mean, I,
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.340]   I'm not surprised by this.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.820]   You're saying the Apple store is the B Dalton of computer sales.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.660]   No, computer sales.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.660]   Much, much, much, much.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.500]   (laughing)
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.340]   No, not at all.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.340]   Well, there is a point to that in the sense that
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:41.060]   you get, again, people going into the Apple stores
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.060]   in the malls now.
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:42.900]   Right.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.900]   Who didn't go there to buy a computer.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.740]   They're wondering.
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.660]   And they see all that excitement.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.660]   And people moving around.
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:54.300]   And at least in my local mall, the store is filled.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.500]   In contrast to about five years ago,
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.220]   when Apple stores were filled with salespeople
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.900]   who were stupid and really insulting almost,
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.340]   they have completely revamped their staff,
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.740]   their customer attitudes.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.060]   And I think they've done it wonderfully.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.620]   I'm quite impressed.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.660]   But people who go to a mall
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.500]   don't necessarily go there to buy a computer,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.900]   but they get sucked into the Apple thing
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.020]   and they see them and quite often they think,
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.540]   "Golly, that looks especially like this."
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.180]   Oh, even even I can get sucked into this.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.300]   I mean, listen, it's amazing.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.780]   I haven't walked out of one of these stores
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.220]   with a Macbook Pro already.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.740]   Yeah, and especially after Vista.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.980]   I think Apple stores are destination stores.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   I think you have something going in there.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.220]   But people will go to the mall
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.820]   just to go to an Apple store.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.060]   That's particularly true.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.460]   Every single mall visit I've made in the last five visits
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.140]   has been just for the Mac store.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.980]   But I don't like it.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.820]   But I would say that--
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.900]   This is a lot about you, by the way.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.900]   I know.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.740]   (laughing)
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.580]   Certainly.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.380]   I wouldn't be too much into that one, eh?
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.780]   (laughing)
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.700]   Yeah, I mean, certainly most of the people
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:06.340]   who go to an Apple store go to a mall,
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.380]   but I do not think the reverse is a true statement.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.780]   Oh, false syllogism again.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.020]   I get to me every time.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.020]   Every time.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.380]   There wasn't to buy size stars.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.740]   I'll tell you that the clone maker,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.740]   which basically is out of business now
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.580]   thanks to the recent court decision saying
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.420]   that they did not have any right
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.420]   to put OS 10 on their PCs that they were selling.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.260]   They--
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.260]   Can I go and buy one right now?
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.100]   Do they still--
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:30.940]   Are they on-kind?
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:31.780]   You know, that's a good question.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.620]   Would you--
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.620]   I think they're still operating.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.900]   But they were so mortally wounded by that decision
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.860]   that it's probably just a matter of time.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.580]   You think the people would be going there like crazy,
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.860]   like last chance to get one.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.500]   I think what's telling is that they sold very few.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.220]   They told venture capitalists when they were looking
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.580]   for investment that they were going to sell millions--
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.140]   hundreds of millions.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.980]   According to this article in Computer World, they said--
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.620]   no, not hundreds.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.500]   They said they sell 12 million machines.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.460]   This is the number.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.420]   I just pull--
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.020]   yo, we'll sell 12 million machines in 2011.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.020]   It turns out--
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.900]   They're burning bridges thing too, right?
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.780]   They have this rebel EFI thing, which
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.580]   is the scorched earth policy.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.940]   If Apple won't let us do this, we'll
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.140]   give away the tools so that anyone can do it.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:19.980]   Ha ha.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.180]   You know?
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.180]   It's really--
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.340]   It's so petty.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.740]   You can go to the store right now.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.380]   You can call them.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.740]   I'm looking at the store right now.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.380]   Would anyone--
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:27.660]   I know.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.820]   But could you imagine giving your credit card
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.620]   number to these people?
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.660]   Well, I know.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.980]   It is a open duo with Mac OS 10699.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.860]   You can buy the rebel-- or actually download the rebel EFI.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.540]   That's free.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.980]   So apparently, according to this article--
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.540]   I don't know where they get this number.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.740]   But according to this article, size star sold--
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.140]   Not like 6.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.620]   Not 12 million.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.380]   6 or 7--
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.620]   Not 1 million.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.220]   768.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.020]   768.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.300]   I don't know where they got that number.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.180]   No, even tech crunch sells more computers than that.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.980]   Does anybody know if it works?
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.260]   Yeah, it does work.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.540]   I mean, I've got a hack in size.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.260]   Who owns one?
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.260]   Yeah.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.140]   They work quite well.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:13.620]   Oh, I'm sure.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.820]   But it's such a dicey proposition.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.420]   The problem isn't that it works.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.780]   The problem is what happens six months from now
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.260]   when this company's long gone?
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:27.380]   And Apple releases Mac OS 10 10.6.3 or whatever.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.380]   And it just doesn't work on this machine, right?
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.940]   I mean, this is a horrible future to contemplate.
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.100]   I can't imagine buying something like this.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.420]   What you pay for with a Mac, of course,
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.220]   is the whole Mac experience, the support group,
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.660]   the enthusiasm, the genius bar.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:51.260]   You get it all as one package and trying to clone it
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:57.420]   and hack your way into building a different kind of Mac
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.740]   is just not--
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.740]   that's not the kind of thing that sells very well.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.940]   There won't be many people who want to do that.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.900]   No, I think exactly right.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.300]   I mean, it's 768.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.180]   I mean, anyway, well known.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.260]   There are more Linux computers.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.100]   There are more--
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.540]   There's a lot of POS computers.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.740]   In addition, there are a lot of people
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:23.740]   who build their own Intel systems and including PCs.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.260]   There are a lot of people who would prefer to build
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.500]   their own high-end gaming machine.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.620]   Most of my machines, in fact, every day,
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.540]   one of my look at around here, every PC I look at,
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.820]   I built myself.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.940]   I think that's less common, though, than it used to be.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.260]   I mean, that really was the thing.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.860]   But I think now, I mean, people just go--
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:43.420]   There are two.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.700]   I would actually-- if I could throw OS 10 on a machine,
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.420]   I would.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.500]   And that's not hard to do.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.060]   Especially with this Rebel EFI.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.500]   I mean, it's not hard to do.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.180]   There's probably more hack-and-toshes out there.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:53.740]   I think so.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.380]   There's 768.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.060]   Sci-star machine.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.460]   I think Colleen has 768 upstairs.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:03.540]   You don't have ROMs and things you have to duplicate
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.020]   the way you did back with old Apple
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.460]   when you were trying to hack an Apple.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.540]   Oddly enough, you don't.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.660]   And that was Apple's anti-piracy measure in the early days,
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.140]   is if you didn't have the ROMs.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.260]   But now there's nothing to copy.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.820]   You build a stock PC.
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.660]   The only thing is that they don't use BIOS.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.100]   They use EFI for booting.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.740]   But that's easy to get around.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.140]   And then it's all on the disk.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.460]   It's all in software.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.180]   You know what the future of Sci-star is, of course, is?
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:30.460]   What's that?
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:31.660]   It's the Amiga.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.380]   You know, if they make an Amiga, they'd sell a few of those.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.500]   They probably sold more than 768.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.500]   They probably sell more than 768.
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:41.100]   I think there's a lot.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.700]   I think this group right here would buy five or six.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.460]   I would buy one.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.420]   Steve Gibson's already purchased--
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.580]   I think he's got 20 PDP-8s in his garage.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.900]   Just in case.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   He's got a PDP-8 cluster that has enough--
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.180]   as much power as my iPhone, almost.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.180]   That's good.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.420]   It's his goal.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.340]   Steve's goal is to, after he retires,
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.420]   to write a PDP-8 operating system from scratch.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:08.900]   Wow.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.780]   Why?
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.620]   Good question, Jerry.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.060]   I think you might have run over to Irvine.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:13.700]   He went to the U.S.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.580]   He is anticipating having time to kill.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.580]   Yes.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.700]   He just likes the instructions set.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:24.100]   I guess it's what's happened is that it is hard.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.260]   This is so cheap.
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.100]   Nobody refurbishes them with spin-right anymore.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.740]   You just throw them away when they start skipping and giving
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.620]   soft errors.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.620]   You just clone the disc and throw the old one in a trash.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:36.180]   That's right.
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:41.540]   And that was his main way of your life,
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.940]   was keeping hard disc running.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.580]   He still sells--
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.580]   Nobody believed could run the man's a miracle worker.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.100]   No.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.660]   But nobody wants the miracle anymore.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.860]   Well, you know the real problem.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.660]   Being able to cure Barry Barry, we already
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.740]   know how to do it with vitamins.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.020]   We don't eat a physician who could lay on hands and magically
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.140]   take your Barry Barry and your Ricketts away.
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.420]   Actually, Steve did a show about vitamin D.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.660]   He's very big into vitamin D. So that's more apt than you know.
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.660]   Oh, boy.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.540]   Well, the real-- I'll tell you, the real end of the line,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.340]   the light at the end of the tunnel that's
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.300]   the oncoming train for Steve is that SSD, these solid state
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.220]   drives, Spinnwright doesn't work on.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.660]   You don't need Spinnwright.
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.380]   They don't work the same way.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.980]   I've just got a solid state drive, which I am going to put
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.260]   in this MacBook Pro.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.380]   It would be in it already, except that I'm
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.660]   using the MacBook Pro for today's show.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.980]   And I didn't want to take it apart in case I couldn't get it
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.460]   back together again.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:48.020]   But we have 100 something gigabyte solid state drive
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:48.740]   for a Mac.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:54.660]   I got the Intel, Newegg was selling the Intel 25X25M
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.740]   for 468 bucks.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.540]   I just bought it because it was so cheap under 28.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.340]   Oh, no, I'm so--
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:46:59.820]   What's the storage?
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:00.500]   128.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.900]   I think it was 160.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.900]   160 is a great deal.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.180]   I think that's the new one, right?
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:04.660]   This is the--
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.020]   This is X25M.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:06.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.500]   It's the drive you want to get.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:08.980]   I'm Jerry.
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.780]   I did what you're about to do on my MacBook Pro,
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.300]   unbelievable response.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.940]   Just fantastic.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.860]   Yeah, Phil Tharff's got one he says,
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.580]   when you turn the machine on it just instantly boots.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.020]   Just one moment, there it is.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.300]   Instant boot.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.980]   So you said $468, and you said it's really cheap.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.900]   For an SSG.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:29.340]   For an SSG.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.780]   I almost called him on that.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.780]   Well, no, it was like--
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.740]   It's still 400-- you know how many real hard drives?
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.940]   I know how to drive.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.460]   You know what?
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.500]   160 gig hard drives now.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.660]   Nothing.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.220]   Because nobody wants one.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.180]   I have-- I buy-- for recording all the video,
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:50.460]   we buy 1 and 1/2 terabyte drives from Newegg for $99.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:50.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.060]   So you're right.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:52.580]   Right.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:57.860]   That's seven or so terabytes of data that I could get.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.340]   I think if you have a lust for speed, it's--
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.140]   That's good.
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.460]   You might want to do that.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:07.580]   I had one of the Samsung 256 gigabyte drives
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.460]   that I tested in a Dell Inspron, and it was beautiful.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.860]   And they're touting it for gamers,
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.020]   which is really interesting.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.100]   Because they get up higher and faster.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.060]   That's kind of the marketplace that will drool over it.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:22.860]   But it's still like-- that was $700 for a hard drive.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.380]   And--
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.020]   Or it always pernails law back in 1983.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.780]   I said, silicon is cheaper than iron.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.100]   And therefore, silicon memory is going
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.500]   to displace spinning metal.
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.780]   And spinning metal will go away.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.100]   26 years later, you didn't mention that part.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.420]   Eventually, I triumphed.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.940]   Your wish has been granted.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.500]   However, it may take a little time.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.340]   No, it's true.
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.580]   I thought-- I probably was reading you.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:56.660]   And I was sure that mechanical drives were on the way out
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:02.220]   that by the year 2000, we'd be using some sort of optical or--
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.020]   I said it flatly that by the year 2000,
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.860]   spinning metal would go away.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.260]   But of course, that was in--
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.540]   that was in the days when a 5 megabyte hard drive
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.860]   was the size of a power cabinet.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.660]   And a house like them, when you turned it on,
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:21.500]   I had a Honeywell bull along with a Lilith.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.660]   If you remember the Lilith--
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.740]   Lilith, I remember Lilith.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:24.260]   Yep.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.860]   And it had a Honeywell bull.
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.420]   Five-- maybe it was 10--
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.460]   megabyte hard drive.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.220]   And it literally was the size of a two drawers
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.820]   power cabinet for the drive.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:42.540]   Well, Shoemaker, when I was on the board of the Lowell Observatory,
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:47.300]   Shoemaker used to keep his asteroids on old deck platters.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.740]   The platters were 10 inches across,
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.300]   and they held 32 megabytes.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.660]   And he had 300 megabytes of asteroid data,
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.900]   and he had to keep swapping those disks back and forth.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.700]   I managed to get him a 300 megabyte Winchester,
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.100]   and he put all that stuff on it.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:08.420]   And he bought me the best dinner I've had in a long time.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.180]   He was happy.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.100]   Now I have 10 times that in my pocket.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.900]   Sure.
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:18.020]   So I thought back in those days, I
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.980]   thought it was obvious that Silicon was cheaper than iron.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.740]   And what we did, in fact, are in in that prediction,
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:30.620]   was that the faster computers made data separation so much easier
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.940]   so you can get so very much more owned
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.260]   to a piece of spinning metal than we could.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.420]   So we went from five megabytes to 300 megabytes
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:44.900]   to a thousand megabytes in very little time.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:45.820]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.740]   I remember when Office 97 came out,
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.140]   it was something like 400 megabytes.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:56.140]   And I complained that it was bloatware and said so in the column.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.340]   And that turned out to be a silly thing to say,
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:04.460]   because within a few months, gigabyte hard drives were cheap.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.100]   And 10 gigabyte drives were coming out.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.180]   And you didn't care that it was 400 megabytes
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.980]   to have the office be that big.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.940]   You know what's funny about that is the new version of Office
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.900]   isn't much bigger than that.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:23.380]   I just noticed on one of the downloads, it was about 450 megabytes.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.340]   This is Office 2010, the beta.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:31.220]   Yeah, that looks like a real improvement.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:35.020]   That's worth going from 2003 to I think.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:35.660]   We were talking--
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.860]   What's 2007 as a download?
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.780]   Oh, I don't know how big it is.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.180]   We were talking, Paul and I are Windows Weekly
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.580]   about this new installation technique
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:50.620]   that Microsoft's using for one of the versions of Office 2000.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.740]   One of the betas, what do they call that?
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.660]   It's a click to run.
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:54.500]   Click to run.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.500]   This is a streaming install.
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.380]   It's application virtualization.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.860]   You actually get a virtualized version of Office
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.460]   that runs Sandbox from the rest of your system.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:05.420]   It's wild.
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.500]   And is this the way they're going to do it from now on?
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.740]   Is that the idea?
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:09.580]   It's one of the ways.
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:14.700]   And I think this is sort of the future of application
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.380]   deployment on Windows.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.980]   It takes the application deployment model from the Mac,
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:23.980]   which is sort of drag and drop, and it adds Sandboxing.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.220]   And none of you guys got to PDC, did you?
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:28.980]   No, Paul was there.
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.220]   I didn't see you there.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:30.740]   Oh, did you?
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:31.740]   I didn't see you.
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.060]   Paul saw you because that's--
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:33.740]   We were talking.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.380]   That's how we were talking.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.620]   I helped you find the Splenda.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:36.620]   You might.
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.980]   I mean, I remember that.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.260]   He's the handsome guy with the pseudo-sugar.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.340]   I had just come back from Washington,
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.300]   so I even missed the first day of it,
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.860]   and I got to the second.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:52.980]   But I was impressed with how much progress Microsoft
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:58.740]   has made in incorporating sanity into cloud computing
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:05.740]   operations and integrating it all with Silverlight and Office
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.740]   2010.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.620]   And just they're really bringing all that stuff together.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.860]   And they're quite impressive to me.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.620]   Was it Ray Auss?
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.820]   I haven't got it yet.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.140]   But they will.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.420]   Is that Ray Aussie's influence?
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.140]   Must be.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.220]   I would think so.
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.140]   But they seem to have to fight together.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.620]   They now-- I mean, one of the things they were saying
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:35.900]   is nobody really wants to have his livelihood out in the cloud.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.980]   You want local copies of important stuff.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.980]   Or-- I mean, you just want it.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:41.940]   That's all.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.860]   And to try to think that you're going to live off
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.500]   of the cloud is crazy.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.780]   On the other hand, there are a lot of things
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:51.140]   you can do with it, and particularly collaborations.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.100]   Niven and I collaborate by essentially sending files back
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:59.900]   and forth and using Office Word comparison
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.300]   to compare versions.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.020]   You still working together?
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:03.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:07.020]   We got a big advance for a new novel, which is doing about
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:07.580]   here so long.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.460]   Oh, that's exciting.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.260]   I had no idea.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:10.900]   That's wonderful.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:13.020]   Well, we're hitting the Earth with something big again.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.020]   Oh, damn.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:19.220]   You made such a mess last time.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.900]   The most lucrative thing I ever did in my life
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.460]   was hit the Earth with something big in Lucifer's hammer.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:28.660]   And then in football, which was the number one time's best
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.540]   seller list at one time.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.980]   And so we thought, well, in these hard times, what will we do?
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.540]   Let's destroy the Earth again.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.140]   So--
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:36.900]   Why is it?
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:37.940]   I wanted to ask you this.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.020]   I mean, the books like the Stand, Your Book, The Road,
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:45.460]   why is it we love these post-apocalypse stories?
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.420]   What is it about us?
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:47.780]   Do you think?
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:52.180]   Well, because I think most people--
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.540]   well, first it doesn't take any imagination
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.540]   of future technologies.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.180]   Yeah, all you get is stoning.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:03.740]   Because you basically take a little bit ahead of now,
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.460]   and then you cripple it.
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.380]   Right.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.460]   But I think most readers can imagine themselves
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.580]   in that situation.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.500]   I think you're right.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.620]   In fact, I have this--
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.660]   I mean, the middle of almost towards the end, actually,
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:17.820]   Lucerus Hammer.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.700]   And my whole worldview has changed.
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:21.540]   One of the things that you say in there, which I think
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.700]   is so important, is that we live on this thin shell
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.140]   of technology that really very few of us understand.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:29.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.620]   That was the Alderson character.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.660]   The guy with diabetes, the JPL scientist.
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.940]   He was the only one who understood how the hell to make
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.540]   the farm run, you know?
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.100]   Everybody else had the ability to do things,
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.380]   but they didn't know what they were doing.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.820]   And a postman, he didn't know anything about it.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.740]   And yet you've got to keep the civilization running
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.460]   with what you have and who you have.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.900]   You point out that there's only 30 days worth of food
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.140]   in the US that--
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.420]   --you take away the electricity, and there's
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.940]   going to be riots within 30 days.
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:03.180]   It's just a given.
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:05.140]   Hey, our power went out last night
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.460]   because they were working down the street.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.660]   And my daughter started asking who we were going to eat first.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:11.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.140]   Canada doesn't say--
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:12.740]   It's a good five minutes.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.100]   --to go right to cannibalism.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.100]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.700]   No, the name is Dog.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:17.260]   I'm taking the--
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.060]   I'm taking Park.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.660]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.940]   Kind of the weak link in the chain.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:23.060]   As long as we're talking about these great books,
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.500]   I should do the Audible ad because what
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.020]   a great opportunity to mention that you can now
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.460]   get thanks to this great Audible Frontiers program.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:35.100]   You can get two of Jerry's most wonderful books.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.060]   What you just heard, Dwight, say the greatest science fiction
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:40.500]   books of all time at Audible.com.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.940]   And I don't know about you, Jerry.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.900]   I mean, I love reading, but there's
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.620]   something about listening to a book that just brings it to life.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.140]   I feel like I'm watching the movie of Lucifer's Hammer.
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:52.660]   I can see what's happening.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:55.620]   It's vivid because I'm listening to it.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.180]   And you don't lose a word.
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.460]   It's not like these are abridged.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.660]   These are the full versions, which means they're long listens.
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:03.220]   I like it.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.300]   And you can get it absolutely free right now.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.700]   And Jerry still gets paid.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.020]   So that's good.
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:11.060]   It's just a way to get you signed up
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.540]   to the Audible Platinum account.
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.780]   If you go to Audible.com/twit2, that's the account I have.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.260]   It's two books a month.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.020]   That's kind of my minimum.
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.380]   And I don't even have a commute, but I just make a point.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.420]   Always to listen to Audible.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.740]   And the book I'm listening to right now is Lucifer's Hammer.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:30.260]   That could be Book 1, 24 hours and 32 minutes.
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.940]   Mark Vider, I think, did a very good job.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:33.260]   You agree, Jerry, of reading it?
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.180]   Have you heard the--
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:35.300]   I have heard it.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.980]   And I think Audible does a great job of finding people
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:39.700]   to read these.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:40.740]   And they do read it.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:44.780]   They read the book before they start reading it into the mic.
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.700]   So they have some understanding of what
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:48.580]   the book is about.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.820]   Did he contact you at any point and ask you
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.700]   for clarification or pronunciation or anything like that?
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.180]   Not really.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.140]   I think I have had a few questions.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:59.860]   I'm not quite sure on which book.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:04.500]   So I get emails asking particularly when I'm made up words.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:08.500]   And that means more likely to be moat or one of the books
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.060]   with aliens in it.
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.300]   Everybody can't figure out how you pronounce fume.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.860]   I think it's moat.
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:19.740]   Yeah, that was obvious to me.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.580]   I'm curious when anyone else is from.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.500]   Larry did that in "Protect Her," too.
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.900]   He's got an alien that--
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:30.060]   and the narrator on that's a very old audio version of it.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:31.300]   But he did a pretty good job of--
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.820]   [GRUNTS]
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.900]   Hey, talks like this.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:38.100]   The second book, "Mote and God's Eye,"
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:41.660]   another great classic by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournell.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.340]   How come Larry's name comes first, Jerry?
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.700]   Is it alphabetical?
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.060]   It's alphabetical, but it's also the case
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:51.300]   that while I was well-known in the technology field
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:52.940]   and in--
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:57.780]   you must remember, Leo, I didn't start writing for a living
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.060]   until 1972.
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.900]   Well, so these were among your first books.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.900]   Those were among my first books.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.060]   And there's a reason why I lived in to name on them.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:11.940]   And I decided to stop being an aerospace scientist
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:16.420]   and to stop being a college professor.
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.380]   I was head of the political science department
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.660]   at Pepperdine at one time.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.180]   So when I decided I was going to try being a writer for a living,
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:29.740]   I decided, all right, is there anybody around who's well-known
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:33.180]   so I can get a bit ahead in this business,
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.580]   whether I have been to build up from scratch.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:38.380]   And there were two people I was sure I could work with.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.940]   One was Paul Anderson, who's dead now.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.380]   He was my best friend for years.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.220]   But he lived up in the Bay Area, and that's
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:46.900]   before we had small computers.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.900]   So we went to mail stuff back and forth,
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.060]   and it just wasn't practical.
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.220]   And the other was Niven, who I hadn't met,
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.060]   but I'd read his stuff, and I thought, yep, that's it.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.260]   So I looked him up at Science Fiction Club,
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.740]   and we got to talking, and we sat down one night
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:06.820]   with a couple of bottles of brandy and a big pot of coffee.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:11.220]   And by morning, we had an outline for the Moten Gods Eye.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.420]   That book has sold like four million copies.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   That is or was, the last time I had occasion
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:23.620]   to see their books, which was when they sold the science fiction
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.220]   line to Bain Books.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:31.660]   Moten Gods Eye was the top earning science fiction book
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.500]   in the history of Simon & Schuster.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:40.540]   It out-earned Sagan's cosmos.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:43.700]   Now, Sagan got a bigger advance from movie.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.300]   But in terms of sales, out-so-old cosmo.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.780]   I haven't made movies of either of these.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.340]   I was going to say, where's the movie?
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.900]   Oh, I'm sorry, not Cods--
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.460]   Sagan's big book, The Alien Contact.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.180]   Contact, I'm sorry, Matt.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.060]   Both are about first contact, right?
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:01.660]   Yeah.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.660]   Contact did not sell-- in fact, oddly enough,
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.380]   contact didn't sell as well as Inferno.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.260]   But the reason Niven and I worked together--
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.020]   I mean, we worked together well, but it was intentional on my part
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:17.980]   that I looked him up.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.260]   And he was better known than me at the time.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.860]   So naturally, his name is first.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.500]   It's also alphabetical.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500]   Well, either way, you want to get these books,
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.060]   and you can listen to them, which brings them just
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.420]   to marvelously to life.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.140]   And you can get them for free.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.700]   But as I said, Jerry still gets paid.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.060]   Audible.com/twit2-- get your first two books free.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.260]   And I think this week, in honor of Jerry's visit to us,
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.980]   you've got to get the Moten God's Eye and Lucifer's Hammer.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.340]   I've got them both.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.180]   In the middle, just about to finish Lucifer's Hammer,
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.060]   and then I'm starting the Moten's God's Eye, which
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.460]   is a story of first contact, which
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.620]   is a great classic science fiction theme.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.940]   L.J. Ganser narrates this one.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.300]   And it's one of those new recordings
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.180]   from Audible Frontiers.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.940]   Both of these just came out in July.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.980]   They never were recorded before, probably, right, Jerry?
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.220]   I mean--
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.860]   I don't think those were.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.940]   By the way, you also ask, why do I work with Niven?
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.380]   Niven writes better than I do.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.740]   I plot better than he does.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.780]   Well, I have a science background,
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.820]   and I do a lot of logic.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:22.940]   And on Lucifer's Hammer, Nature Magazine,
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:27.700]   a few months ago had a big 25th or 30th,
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.380]   whatever it is, anniversary review of Lucifer's Hammer.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.020]   It was big.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.740]   I mean, it was pictures, and it was like a four-page review
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.380]   in Nature Magazine.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:41.100]   And it's kind of interesting, because what did they start with?
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.660]   They started with that dang surfer scene of course.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.380]   I love it.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:45.100]   He surfed Los Angeles.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.660]   I was never a bit mad enough to have write that.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:48.500]   Niven wrote that.
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.460]   That was Niven's.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.500]   That piece.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.260]   And that's what I pay him for.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.860]   That was a great scene.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.940]   And the guy, of course, it's just his one cameo appearance
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.820]   in the book, but he surfs the tidal wave across Los Angeles
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:03.820]   face.
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:04.780]   My true saphonic.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.500]   I love it.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.140]   Well, anyway, there's our pick for the week.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.420]   And I highly recommend it.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.980]   If you've not listened to audiobooks,
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.140]   start with the best and do it from Audible.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:14.940]   There's no one better.
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.460]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.820]   They're yours for free.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.180]   Cancel it anytime you get to keep the books.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.100]   And we thank Audible for supporting this week
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.940]   at Tech for the last few years.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.660]   So let's see.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:30.140]   I know you wanted to talk, Paul Therat, a little bit
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.740]   about this story that Apple--
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.340]   or rather, Windows 7 market share
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:38.020]   has finally topped Apple's market share.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.340]   And you say that's bogus.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.180]   That's ludicrous.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.220]   What is it?
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:42.660]   OK.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.300]   This is from Computer World.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.140]   Market share sells.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.140]   That's it.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.900]   Very simple.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.460]   Market share in the computer industry
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.220]   is typically measured by quarter.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.920]   I suppose we could look at it from a month to month basis.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.860]   But no one really does that.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:59.020]   And the figure that you're citing
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.580]   and the figure that has been cited online is--
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.980]   From Net Application.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.980]   It is, yeah, from a web analytics company.
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.100]   So what they're doing is they're looking at people who browse
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.720]   to their websites, to the websites that they monitor,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.020]   whatever they are.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.860]   And they determine who's running what.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:16.380]   So what they were saying was that over two days
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.060]   last weekend, Windows 7--
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:24.900]   I guess I would call it-- web usage share exceeded 5%.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.480]   But it's really web usage share for the sites
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.040]   that they monitor, whatever those sites are.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.360]   So there are some generalizations.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.400]   Windows 7 users surf more than Mac user.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.200]   You're right.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.400]   It doesn't really tell you.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.400]   You can make some general statements about it.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.440]   There's no doubt--
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.960]   Windows 7, just by virtue of the fact
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   that it's going out on all these new PCs this quarter,
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.560]   it will exceed the actual market share of the Mac
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.320]   by a huge percentage.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.720]   I would assume that this quarter.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.960]   And the usage share, the actual number of people running
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.800]   Windows 7 day to day, we'll exceed that of Mac OS 10,
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.000]   probably this quarter as well.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.360]   But whatever.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.840]   I mean, that's not a profound statement.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.880]   It's just a statement of fact.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.800]   So this web analytics company, whatever they are--
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.040]   Net applications.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.680]   Net applications.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.800]   That's not what they measure.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.300]   Right.
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.800]   So actually, Bomber told the shareholders
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.920]   meeting that the Windows 7 had sold twice the number
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.200]   of copies of any other Microsoft operating system
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.120]   in the same time span.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.120]   So as--
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.360]   Which is pretty good.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.200]   Well, is it-- I mean, not to be a jerk about that,
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.040]   but I mean, the market for PCs, the number of people
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.200]   using PCs is bigger than it's ever been.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.320]   I think it's bigger-- comparing it to Vista is important
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.000]   because obviously they want to show that Windows 7 has
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:43.600]   turned the corner.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.360]   It's better than Vista.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.640]   But if you were to go back three years ago
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.280]   and look at the numbers for Vista,
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.840]   they were pretty solid right in the beginning.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.520]   It wasn't until the next quarter that we sort of saw
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.400]   some issues.
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.480]   And of course, all the complaints started coming in
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:00.680]   from people with incompatibilityations and so forth.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.720]   So--
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.880]   I love Bomber's statement to the shareholders.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.360]   When I asked about Apple's market share,
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.240]   especially with young people, he said, some of its marketing,
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.920]   some of its phase of life, the truth is we do quite well,
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.800]   even among college students.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.200]   Yes, yes.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.840]   Sorry about that.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.960]   Even those hippies by Windows sometimes.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.600]   Exactly.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.080]   Well, that company, Net Applications,
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.200]   is pretty controversial.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.600]   A lot of analysts like to point to them
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.400]   and a lot of journalists like to point to them.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.840]   And I have done that myself.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.680]   It's a story.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.080]   But all they measure is what's being used on the web.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.600]   They have a pretty big database of companies
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.880]   that they pull from, but it's still not
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.440]   going to be the whole web.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.120]   It's good for actually representatives.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.280]   I think it's good for showing trends,
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.160]   but for complete numbers, the real picture,
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.960]   it's not always accurate.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   Right.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.680]   It doesn't mean that 5% of the people on computers
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.840]   are using Windows 7.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.320]   It just doesn't mean that.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   Well, of course it doesn't.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.760]   It's very early days, isn't it, for Windows 7?
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.320]   I think--
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:10.600]   Right.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.280]   And everyone is looking for some indication
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.080]   that Windows 7 is doing something, whatever that something is.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.160]   It's either doing great, it's doing OK.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.680]   If it's doing anything other than great,
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.920]   it's obviously a little bit of a disappointment.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.680]   There's always some story to be told around this thing.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.320]   But I don't know.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.680]   To me, this is nothing.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.240]   This doesn't mean anything.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.880]   Sometimes in January, the sales figures will come out.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.600]   That's what we'll know.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.880]   How many PCs were sold?
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.320]   We'll have some market share numbers.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:50.240]   Obviously, Windows 7 is going to be a big deal.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.720]   It's going to be-- it will go out on most of the computers
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.560]   that are sold as quarter.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.840]   Of course.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.240]   Well, I would just like to say that 63% of the people who
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.120]   visited Twit used Windows and 26% used Macintosh.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:06.200]   So Macintosh market share is jumping on my website.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.000]   It's huge.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.320]   It's never been bigger.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.840]   And it's weird that the people who listen to your stuff
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.680]   would be big on the Mac.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.240]   Hey, 5% use Linux, 2% use the iPhone.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.360]   5% use Linux.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.120]   I mean, you're not insane.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.040]   That's insane, right?
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.240]   I mean, 5%.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:21.760]   That's a lot.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.880]   5%.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.720]   5% are using Linux.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.240]   That's bigger than the Mac's worldwide market share.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:27.840]   Let's see.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.120]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.120]   OK.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120]   OK.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:31.800]   It's not--
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.640]   But get this.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.960]   Get this.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.480]   OK.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.800]   OK, among Windows users, this is Twit.TV.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.120]   This is the website that people go.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.640]   And this is in the past month.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.840]   44% used XP.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.920]   33% used something that identified as NT.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.240]   20% used Vista.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.360]   And I don't even see Windows 7 on here.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:54.760]   Sure.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.960]   So no one's using Windows 7.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.280]   24 people visited with Windows ME.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.120]   I think we have your headline.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.680]   Nobody wants a Windows 7 global disaster.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.360]   The exclusive by Leo LeBore.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.280]   It must be the NT must be Windows 7.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.000]   I don't understand what NT is seeing.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.360]   Well, you're looking at browsers.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.760]   So this is the 6.1 thing.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.800]   That's a browser string.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   It's just what the--
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.760]   It shows up.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.800]   So a lot of the Mozilla type browsers
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.200]   will say NT something.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:26.880]   Right.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.200]   So this is completely worthless.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.000]   Absolutely.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.600]   But you should write a story, because Greg Kaiser would pick it up.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.040]   It's huge.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.600]   It's massive.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.000]   51-month-wise, all those who are using Vista
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.400]   to immediately convert to Windows 7.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.720]   Yes, I agree with you on that.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.480]   I'm concerned about the people who are running Windows ME.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.760]   Who are those 24 people?
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.720]   What's up with that?
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.600]   And why the way that really?
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.640]   No, I'm still running the original version
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.600]   of Windows Movie Maker.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.160]   I'm just curious.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.000]   I'm going to ask you some technical questions.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.320]   How come it doesn't work?
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.560]   So Jerry, you've been happy with Windows
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.280]   7 experience.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:16.000]   I have, as you know, I have Macs and PCs.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.040]   And I am finding that the differences,
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.200]   even in the operating system philosophy
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.920]   and the usability, are flat vanishing.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.120]   Microsoft has been long known for being
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.080]   an embrace and extend company.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.320]   And I think they kind of got it with Windows 7.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.480]   It really is easy to use.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:43.280]   And a lot of things that used to be very complicated
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.600]   are very simple.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.200]   And I can recommend-- again, I didn't write it--
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.720]   Windows 7 Ultimate God by O'Reilly, right?
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.200]   It's a brand new book, Definitive God from O'Reilly.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.400]   And if you were to go through this thing,
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.800]   I found tons of stuff built into Windows 7.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.160]   I didn't know was there.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.640]   And it's just getting more Mac-like in a lot of ways.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.880]   Paul, I think you need to send him a copy of Windows 7
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.000]   Secrets, because there's even more stuff in that book.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:17.920]   Well, I guess--
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.840]   I guess if we review a copy--
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.160]   I can--
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.040]   In the Netherlands and they have to be this guy.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.600]   I guess my reviews are popular because I get more books
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.240]   to review than I really feel like.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.840]   But doing, but I'll certainly pick yours out.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.440]   Oh, you'll like it, Jerry.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440]   You'll like it.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.280]   You'll like it or else.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.720]   It's a good book.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.080]   It's a really good book.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.800]   Why did you say something happened in the Netherlands
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.320]   with you?
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.160]   No, I was going to say-- someone asked me--
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.280]   actually, I thought it was a profound question, which
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.880]   was some guy came up to me in the Netherlands.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.000]   And he said, I'm looking at your book here.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.840]   And I just have one question.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.480]   If Windows 7 is so easy, how come this book is 1,000 pages?
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480]   I thought, yeah.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480]   Good point.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.680]   That's a good point.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.720]   I bought it on my Kindle.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.080]   The whole book, I got the full version.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.960]   Did you ever do the stripped down version for the Kindle
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   Paul that you were going to do?
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.000]   Yeah, there is a stripped down best of version for the Kindle.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.360]   But I got the whole thing in it.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.600]   It's a lot lighter that way.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.000]   It's much lighter on the Kindle.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   And actually, if you get the full version,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.160]   it's still as light as the other version.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.040]   You see?
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.360]   You don't really save me any way.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.640]   Yet another benefit of the Kindle.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.600]   Who published--
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.080]   How do you decide what to put--
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.560]   what to take out for a stripped down version?
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560]   Well, the stripped down version--
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.560]   What a not-intrigued--
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.160]   Yeah, so it was truly stripped down.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.080]   It was literally-- it was an odd request.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.840]   They wanted a best of version.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.160]   And they wanted it to be a very small selection of secrets.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.440]   So it doesn't actually work out to one.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.520]   It's just the big secrets.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.920]   Yeah, it's the--
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.880]   I looked at these chapters.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.520]   I thought, what are the big things, the biggest things
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.840]   from each chapter?
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.240]   So some of them were-- there was one.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.760]   Some of them were-- there were two--
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.920]   one or two, I think there were three.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.120]   But it's a very finite selection of--
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.040]   I don't know.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.120]   Do I--
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.800]   Are you writing a book on Windows 7?
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.960]   No, I'm writing a Mac switch book at the moment.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.600]   Switching to Windows?
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.000]   You're fading out, do I?
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.920]   Somebody's fading.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.240]   It's a Mac switch book.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.880]   I actually approached Peach Pit, the publisher who did the--
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.040]   when I was first a book that I wrote with Larry Maggud.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:37.120]   And they didn't want to do a Windows 7 book
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.120]   in the same series.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:38.640]   Really?
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.520]   Because the Vista book had not done well.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.360]   They just-- they didn't want to take the chance.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.600]   This decision was made a while back.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.960]   And I kind of wish they had.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.600]   Big mistake, yeah.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.400]   Larry wrote a little--
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:53.480]   Vista will go away, and 7 will replace it on every machine
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.280]   running Vista.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.920]   There is no reason not to replace it with Windows 7.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.840]   It didn't even cost that much if you use those family upgrade
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.480]   packs that Microsoft sells.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.960]   It's going to be Vista who very soon.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:08.560]   It's an odd thing.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.280]   And by the way, whatever it's worth--
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.440]   Vista, especially now after the upgrades and so forth,
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.400]   isn't terrible.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.560]   But we are going to be in this world where it's
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.000]   going to be XP in 7.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   And it's just a weird thing.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.920]   It's never really happened before in the Windows world
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.280]   like that.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.840]   Well, if they get their virtualization technology,
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.200]   installation technology running properly,
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.000]   so that you can--
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.360]   essentially, so that you can go from XP to Windows 7 in one
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.560]   jump without having to go through Vista first, I think a lot
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.320]   of the XP machines will cease to be XP and become
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.080]   Windows 7 also.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.440]   Yeah, my Dell laptop is a 7 professional.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.400]   So that means Paul, I could go to Microsoft site and
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.880]   download.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.920]   Do I need a copy of XP or I just download--
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.680]   I'm sorry, what do you want to ask?
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.640]   I have Windows 7 Professional, which means I can do the--
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.360]   Do you mean that Windows XP Professional?
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.400]   No, no, I have 7 Professional, which means I can run the
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.200]   XP and virtualization thing.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.160]   I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.160]   When I download that, does it come with a copy of XP or do I
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:11.640]   also have--
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.280]   It does.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.760]   So it's the whole thing.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.480]   Yep.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:14.960]   For free.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.120]   The virtualized version of XP.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.120]   XP, so good.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.040]   It's like a little toy.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.200]   We throw it in the cereal box.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.960]   We're giving it away.
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   But your processors have 4.7.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.240]   Your silonning on us.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.520]   Hold on Dwight.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.000]   Unplug and plug in, you'd silon.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.240]   Oh no, no silonning.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.600]   Come on, I got to go to the back.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.320]   My or command.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:34.840]   Look at this.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.360]   Oh, that's a-lowning.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:36.880]   Yes.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.360]   Because we were assistant explained to me that you were
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.040]   having problems with silonning, but he couldn't quite
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.920]   explain to me what that--
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.920]   Now you know.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920]   Now you know.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.880]   Now you know.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.760]   Do you watch a Battlestar Galactic Adjurie?
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.200]   I have--
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.000]   I made an awful lot of money out of Battlestar Galactica
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.360]   when it first came out.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.840]   You made money on it?
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.800]   The original one.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.520]   Yeah, way back when Universal did it.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.640]   The way I made money on it was that Fox sued Universal
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.600]   for plagiarism of Star Wars.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.000]   And they claimed that there were something like 82 points
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.720]   of similarity between Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.960]   And at that time--
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.520]   I guess I had just been president of science fiction
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.280]   writers of America.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.560]   And the lawyers for Universal came and said,
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.720]   here's $20,000, write us a brief showing we didn't plagiarize.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.040]   Wow.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.840]   And I looked at it and I said, well, that's easy.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.160]   If you ask me which is the better movie, then no question.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.080]   Star Wars is the better one.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.480]   But if you ask me which is the most original, there ain't
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.960]   an original frame and neither one of them.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.880]   That's the derivative from science fiction that
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.000]   was published in, for instance, the male pair bonding
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:02.040]   between Han Solo and Luke Skywalker was echoed in Battlestar
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.120]   Galactica.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.480]   I said, yeah, and they both got it from Homer, didn't they?
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.440]   It's been around a few years.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.640]   So you were saying, Dwight, before the Cylon invasion--
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.160]   That's for the Cylon invasion.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.960]   We were talking about XP running and virtualization
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.280]   on Windows 7.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:20.560]   Right.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.000]   And it doesn't work with every machine.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:23.360]   Yes.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.240]   You have to have a particular processor that
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.520]   supports hardware-based virtualization in order for it
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.200]   to work.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.520]   And a lot of high-end processors don't do it.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:40.600]   I've got an Intel Core 2 quad processor, a Q8200.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.760]   That's a great processor in a home-built machine.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.480]   It won't do it.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.080]   It won't handle XP mode.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.080]   That's frustrating.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.320]   That's how Microsoft works.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.880]   I don't know if you're familiar with this company.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.320]   But could you run VMware?
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.680]   That's how they do things.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:54.160]   You can.
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.200]   You can run VMware.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.200]   You can run--
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.040]   And then run XP under VMware.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:58.300]   Sure.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.680]   You can run a Sun's virtual box.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.920]   It works fine.
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.840]   So for whatever it's worth, the stuff
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.600]   that they do for corporations, application,
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:09.600]   virtualization, and Microsoft Enterprise desktop
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.680]   virtualization don't suffer from this issue.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.680]   But yeah, it's true.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.760]   If you're an individual and you want to run virtualized versions
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.200]   of XP, although to be fair, there are only a few instances
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.760]   where you'd want to do that.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:25.800]   The compatibility.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.840]   You have to have a processor that's
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.480]   Intel's VTX technology, which I happen to.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.440]   So I know I can do it.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.480]   The AMD version.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.320]   And AMD-- all of AMD's recent processors do.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.840]   Not all of Intel's recent processors.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.840]   Right.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.440]   Edbot did a--
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.920]   First of all, yeah.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.040]   Edbot did a table, right?
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.400]   You can go.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.440]   Or do you have a table?
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.960]   No, he does have an excellent table, yeah.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.160]   That describes all the processes that work and those that
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.320]   don't, yeah.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.160]   So good.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.720]   Now I now know I can run Windows XP.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:55.360]   Well, it's tough because a lot of the core to duo
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.600]   processes of the dual core chips work fine.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.960]   But what Dwight's saying is he has a quad core processor.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.520]   And that's true.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:01.520]   That's true.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.840]   Some of the initial ones that quad cores don't work.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.120]   We do now, by the way, know what causes the signlining.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:10.640]   And--
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:10.960]   Here we do.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.600]   And that's why Jerry subspace--
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.720]   It's subspace for good enough.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:20.160]   Jerry has the different head set, plantronics head set,
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.280]   which doesn't have that problem.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:25.720]   And we sent Dwight the DSP 400, which does.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.960]   It's the chip in it.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.520]   So you did it on purpose.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.400]   Because I wanted to suffer.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.160]   So if I took it out of the--
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.400]   it comes with a couple of plugs that go into the back of a--
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.920]   if I just plug the two analog plugs into the back of my Mac--
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.080]   I don't know.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:41.720]   I probably not.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.480]   It's the chip set.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.920]   And you probably see the adapter chip set.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.520]   You're right.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.320]   I'll just do that next time.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.600]   Well, we find USB works better.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.200]   That's why we do it.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.800]   Anyway, a couple more stories.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.960]   I also want to mention my Mustang,
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.400]   because it really wouldn't be a twit unless I talk about my car.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.600]   But first for Paul--
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:57.960]   Yes, sir.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.160]   --Activision says Call of Duty series.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.840]   All of the titles in the franchise
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:10.040]   pushed past the $3 billion mark in global retail sales--
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:10.600]   Sure.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.100]   --$50.
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:11.600]   Remind me again.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.720]   How much money did Titanic make?
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.120]   I think-- 200 million?
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.120]   No, I must have made it.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:17.520]   I've been a billion.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:17.960]   A billion?
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.880]   I had about $500 if you can't overseas sales.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.520]   But not anywhere close.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:28.040]   A sad, sad joke compared to Call of Duty.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.560]   But now this is since 2003.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.800]   But what a franchise.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.560]   Six titles, the most modern, most recent modern--
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.080]   I think I've contributed to this figure--
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.080]   --Dewonsterably.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.720]   Amazing success for Call of Duty.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.680]   And you say-- and I'll just repeat it here--
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.880]   it is, in fact, the best of the series, the best first person
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.400]   shooter of the year, nay, perhaps even the best first person
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.440]   shooter of all time.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.200]   I just remember everyone was talking up Halo 2 at the time,
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.600]   and Halo 3 when that came out.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.480]   And I kept telling these guys, you know, Call of Duty is where
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.400]   it's at.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:09.200]   By the way, our brilliant chatroom by the name of Ratty
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.840]   says it's $1.8 billion for Titanic.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.640]   For Titanic?
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.040]   Well, that's pretty good.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:14.880]   Not bad.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.840]   Not Call of Duty numbers, but not bad.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.760]   Not bad for the all-so-ran.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:24.400]   He's so competitive that Paul Therat.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.720]   It's not really so much a market share number as it is.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:28.440]   A number.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.840]   It pales.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:30.920]   It's lower.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.560]   It pales, however.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.040]   Sure.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:37.400]   To the market valuation of Facebook.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.360]   Wow.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:38.800]   OK.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.280]   Which, according to the most recent stock sale,
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.120]   is DST, which is one of the investors,
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.200]   has been buying digital sky technologies,
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.720]   is a Russian investment company.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:53.880]   Do you know that the Russians own a big stake in Facebook?
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.480]   It's good stuff.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.160]   And by the way, that's the plot of a Call of Duty movie.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.680]   Or video game.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:00.160]   It is?
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:00.840]   It probably could be.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.360]   Sure.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.560]   Sure.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.880]   Rushing the social media expert.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.160]   Take so far.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:11.200]   Well, when Microsoft made a stake in Facebook a year or so ago,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.160]   I don't remember the exact figure.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.720]   When you make an investment and you buy a certain part
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:20.040]   of the company, that investment then betrays
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.400]   what you feel the company is worth.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.080]   And I remember at the time, the figure for Facebook
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.480]   was incredibly high based on the fact
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.000]   that they sell about $17 an ounce a year.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.120]   I mean, there's nothing there.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:30.640]   Right.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.760]   And it really didn't include what Microsoft
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.040]   was getting in addition to the stake in the company.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.120]   But this case, DST bought $100 million of Facebook shares
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:46.120]   in July from employees and ex-employees at a $16.5 billion
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.760]   valuation.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:48.760]   Wow.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.440]   Now, I wonder how much they were paying over,
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:57.160]   what percentage, the value of the shares they paid on average
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.840]   to get those shares?
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.080]   Right.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.080]   16 times.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.360]   Well, is there a value?
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.480]   Because there's no--
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.560]   it's not a publicly--
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:04.480]   That's a good point.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.160]   It's not even public.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.680]   So there's no value.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.800]   These are just made up numbers.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.120]   It's made up numbers.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.080]   Facebook, however, has just established
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.280]   a dual class stock structure, which always scares me
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.200]   when I hear about that.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.680]   That's how I got screwed by tech TV.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.200]   The existing owners have one class.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.360]   You know, the class A stock, and then the rest of you
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:27.880]   got class B, which means that we can vote, but you can't.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:34.880]   And we're the first to be paid on a transaction.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.440]   Facebook spokesman Larry Yu said,
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.000]   "We did introduce a dual class stock structure
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.320]   because existing shareholders wanted
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:45.440]   to maintain control over voting on certain issues."
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.320]   The thought would be that they would do this because they're
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.640]   about to go public.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.880]   And they would issue B or C class shares to the public offering.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:57.280]   But Mark Zuckerberg went and asked, said, no, no, no.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.720]   And IPO is a few years out.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.600]   He said that in May.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.040]   And the spokesman says, Facebook has no plans to go public.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:08.960]   What would Facebook really be worth if they went public?
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.800]   That's not even possible to guess, right?
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.960]   Because the tech stock market especially is crazy.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.160]   I would buy, I would buy, well, what is Google's valuation now?
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.160]   $6 billion?
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.560]   Right, sure.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.440]   I mean, Facebook's got to be worth that much.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.240]   What do you think, Jerry? Do you have a Facebook page?
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.400]   No, not as much as Google.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.960]   No, but have what these are.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.120]   Sorry, people maintain one for me,
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.960]   but I don't have anything to do with it yet.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.240]   I probably should start incorporating Facebook into my operations.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.960]   It's just that I never have.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.360]   This social media thing is all brand new.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.640]   We talked before the show, trying to persuade Jerry to get a Twitter account.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:52.200]   He was notably not interested.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.560]   Not interested for him.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.920]   And it's interesting he thinks that Facebook would do
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.160]   him good, but Twitter would not be interested.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.080]   Isn't that?
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.040]   Only as a marketing tool.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:11.600]   The only thing I would use Facebook for is to get people to come over to my regular websites.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:17.680]   I have what energy I have left over from writing fiction I put into the website.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.040]   I'm not going to do that on a Facebook page.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.480]   I just don't care that much.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.840]   And I certainly don't really feel like letting the world know every time I'm going to have
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.400]   a Turkey sandwich.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:27.920]   So...
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.880]   I think it's...
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.400]   You know what?
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.640]   Jerry, more power to you.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.520]   I just want you to do more writing.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.240]   I think that that's a reasonable thing for a fan to say, "No, Jerry, focus on the writing.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:41.360]   Don't be wasting your energies on 140 character blips."
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:49.400]   Leo, it's a long tradition in science fiction writing that fans maintain sites for their
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.520]   favorite authors.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:57.440]   And several, and in fact several do in the case with me and with Niven and so forth.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.800]   And I just let them do it.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:04.400]   I pay little attention to the site unless some friend of mine tells me they're doing
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.920]   something goofy.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:13.440]   Like for instance, Wikipedia had some stories about me that just simply weren't true.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.760]   They were flattering stories.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.440]   They just weren't true.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.040]   And I had to go in and try to edit some of that.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.320]   But generally I try to stay away from that sort of thing.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.840]   I've never had anything flattering on Wikipedia.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.840]   So I'm curious what that must be.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:34.400]   What they had me getting a direct commission in the army, which had the only person I ever
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.640]   heard of who got a direct commission with Audie Murphy for having.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.040]   Is that like a battle with promotion where you go?
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.400]   A world-renowned lover.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.520]   I'll go with it, Paul.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.640]   You're not allowed to do it, but I'm going to go on your Wikipedia page right now.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.840]   In fact, I would suggest the chat room.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.640]   It's like the Simpsons episodes.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.640]   No, it's true.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.640]   Please.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.640]   It will be.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:02.440]   Make it so number two.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.600]   How do you all feel about internet gambling?
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.120]   You remember that the rules were, I can't remember if I think it was legislation, wasn't
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.120]   it?
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.760]   The banned internet gambling.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.960]   The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve who are charged with enforcing this, basically
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:25.400]   what they're doing is they're telling credit card companies, financial institutions, you
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.680]   cannot accept payments to settle online wagers.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.360]   That basically makes it impossible to do online gambling.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:40.720]   Financial industry complained that the new rules would be difficult to enforce.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:45.480]   It's like the auto industry complaining that this seatbelt rules would be hard to afford.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.120]   It's so hard to do.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.920]   They say, and actually there may be some merit in this, they say, "What is internet gambling?"
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:58.360]   So they petitioned and now those rules which were supposed to take effect in a week are
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.000]   going to be delayed till June 1st.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:06.680]   I'm betting that the Gambling Enforcement Act, which was passed in 2006, will pass a
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:10.920]   few more years before that comes close to being enforced.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.360]   They want to try to overturn it, the Democratic Congress wants to overturn that.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.320]   The only good thing you can get and it's not good, the only thing you're certain to get
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:23.800]   at a gambling site is spyware.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:26.080]   I wouldn't mind seeing them go away for that reason.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.080]   It's only non-gambling.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:30.480]   It's a gamble.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.120]   It's really a gamble.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:36.000]   Anyway, anybody have an opinion?
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.520]   Gambling sites are like Darwin's law and action.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.360]   They call the herd.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360]   That's right.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.400]   The problem is that it's point of access.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.280]   If it's really easy to gamble, I feel for people who have a gambling problem because
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.600]   at least if the ponies are somewhere out there, you've got to go to the track.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.600]   Now you just...
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:58.440]   We do this thing on Thanksgiving called Beagles and Beer.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.040]   We get up early in the morning and go to the local bar.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.680]   We drink beer and we have Beagles.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.720]   This is a friend of mine said, "Hey, they have Kino.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.720]   Are you going to play some Kino?"
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.960]   And I said, "I have a Kino system."
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.720]   Which is sort of like a gateway drug.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:22.640]   By the way, according to Wikipedia, Paul, you have cured the common cold.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.160]   Let's see, what else have you done?
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.160]   This is amazing, Paul.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.320]   I had no idea your worth a net worth is $3 billion.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.200]   Listen, if it was, I wouldn't be here right now.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.200]   No offense.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.200]   Yeah, I'm offended.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.200]   No offense.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.200]   I'm offended deeply.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200]   All right, real quickly.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:42.360]   I just want to mention before we finish this show up and we have some great final gifts
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.880]   for you all, so don't go anywhere.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:49.760]   Because you really shouldn't say the show will be over after this commercial.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.920]   Listen to the commercial and then we're done.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:58.800]   No, there's great stuff still to come, but I do want to mention Ford's sink.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.000]   Hey, this is great stuff.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.120]   A chance for you to win a nano or a zoom.
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.280]   Time is ticking though.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.600]   You only have till December 9th.
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.920]   They've got 15 nano and 15 zoons.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.520]   They're giving away one every day, kind of as a way of underscoring the fact that Ford
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.440]   sink works with nano's works with zoons.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.160]   To be honest, it works with my droid.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.480]   It works with almost anything that's USB.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.840]   In fact, I've got a USB key here.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:25.200]   You plug this into the USB port in my car and it'll read the MP3s on their index them.
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.960]   And then I press a button on my string wheel and I can say play the Beatles.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.280]   I could say, in fact, I do.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:33.600]   I say play Lucifer's hammer and all of a sudden I'm hearing Lucifer's hammer right where I
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600]   left off.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.600]   This is Skynet.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.760]   It is Skynet.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.000]   The car is smart.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   The car is the computer.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   I love it.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000]   I love it.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   The car is the network.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.360]   If you get a chance, go to a Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.440]   Take a look at Ford sink.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.600]   It is so slick.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.440]   It's Bluetooth phones.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:52.400]   It's got 911 activation.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.880]   If your earbags activate, it's got vehicle history reports.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.720]   It knows the traffic conditions and will reroute you automatically turn by turn directions
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.160]   even without a GPS built into the car.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.200]   I mean, that's the Ford sink doing it.
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.200]   I just love it.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:09.360]   And to find out more, you go to the website sinkmyridepodcast.com.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.760]   And if you'd like to win, the rules are there.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:14.120]   But if you'd like to win, I can give you the short version.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:18.760]   Just tweet, say, listen to the Jerry and the gang on Twitter right now and I'm loving
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:19.760]   it.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:20.920]   And I can't wait to read Dante's.
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:23.400]   I mean, I always call it Dante's Inferno.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:29.720]   Lucifer's hammer and then add the tag pound sink my ride podcast.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.680]   The incredibly intelligent people at Ford will notice that adds you to the drawing and
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:38.280]   you'll be in the drawing to win one of those nanos or zoons full details and more about
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.920]   the incredible sink.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.920]   It's in my car and I'll tell you I drive it.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.280]   I love it at sinkmyridepodcast.com.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:50.680]   We're trying to decide, Paul, if I should drive the Mustang, the Twitmobile down to
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.680]   CES.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.840]   I'm thinking for the I was talking to Scott Monty who's their social media guy.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:00.280]   He said, come down and you could give geeks a test rides and show them a sink.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   So maybe I'll do that.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.280]   It'd be a lot of fun.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.280]   I have it to see.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:09.200]   Listen, if you do that, I will, I will fly there and I will drive it down with you.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.800]   You'll fly to San Francisco and drive down with me?
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:11.800]   Of course.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:12.800]   That would be great.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:13.800]   Road trip.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.800]   You bring the beer.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:16.800]   I'll bring the bagels.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:17.800]   Sure.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:18.960]   We might be using a zoom though.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   I don't know if that's a big problem.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.200]   You can, you know, no, in fact, if I could find my zoom HD, that's what would be living
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.200]   in the, I can't find it.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.960]   It's going to be, you know, it's on a plane somewhere.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:27.960]   That's right.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:28.960]   No, no, no, no.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.640]   It's, it's in a pile here somewhere.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.640]   It's small.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:33.160]   And it just disappears.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.400]   It's almost too small.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.560]   It's too beautiful.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.560]   Too small.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:39.440]   It's too beautiful to succeed.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.440]   It couldn't.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:46.320]   It's just, it's the technology that was too good to ever catch on with a past market.

[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:57.360]   Thank you, Ford, for supporting our wonderful little home grown network here.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:05.440]   And Jerry Pournell is online that if you, as, as we all did, cut your teeth on the chaos
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.440]   manner columns, they're still going.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:13.120]   You can subscribe to my email or you can read them online at chaos manner reviews.com or
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:17.560]   go to Jerry's site, Jerry Pournell.com where it's all there.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.320]   You said there's some politics there, Jerry?
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.320]   Oh, yes.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:25.360]   I tend to be rather libertarian in my views of the world, but yes, they.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.720]   I get into politics and political strategy on my website.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.000]   I don't in the column.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.080]   I try to stay politically neutral in the columns.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:40.880]   You know, I need that because people don't want me to talk politics on the, on the shows,
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:45.360]   but I love to talk about, I think politics is, I had no idea you taught political science.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.920]   Yeah, I used to be head of political science at Pepperdine.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.760]   That was a very long time ago.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.060]   That's great.
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.460]   So there's a education crisis.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:56.460]   You talk about Afghanistan.
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:57.460]   Oh, this is fantastic.
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:00.160]   I'm going to have to start reading these.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:06.960]   The latest big one is the climate consensus turns out maybe to have had as much conspiracy
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.440]   as consensus, which is interesting.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.600]   So where do you come down on global warming?
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:20.100]   With Freeman Dyson, I don't know how you can get CO2 to be useful in heating anything
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:26.560]   except cold dry areas because the water vapor already overwhelmed the CO2 effect everywhere
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.960]   else.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.560]   So you don't think it's the CEO, you don't think it's not even a question of man made
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.560]   or not.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.240]   You don't think there is global warming because CO2.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:39.600]   No, I think there's global warming because there has been since about 1326 when the little
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.180]   ice age ended and we started warming up.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:48.000]   But I think that it most of the warming was in between 1800 and 1870.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.980]   You know this, but you don't remember it.
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:35:01.460]   In 1776 at Harlem Heights on Manhattan Island, Colonel Alexander Hamilton brought the guns
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:07.740]   captured at Tackon, D'Roga across the frozen Hudson River to General George Washington,
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:10.500]   saving Washington's army.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:15.500]   The Hudson hasn't frozen solid enough to walk across since about 1826.
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:23.180]   In other words, things have been warming since 1776 and everybody who's went to grade school
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:26.440]   and had grade school history knows it.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:34.240]   In 800 to 1000, the Vikings had dairy farms in Greenland.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:37.840]   Dairy farms, you can see them, they're under about 30 feet of ice.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.840]   Some of them are finally coming out again, but there's still plenty of ice over them.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:49.460]   The earth has been a lot warmer and a lot colder in human history.
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.920]   We know, we know for a fact.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.640]   So the fact that it's been warming at one degree per century ever since about 1700 should
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.640]   not surprise you.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.040]   Well, I feel a lot better about my Mustang.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.640]   I've got to tell you that right now.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:04.640]   Think of it.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.640]   Is it a ragtime?
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:07.360]   No, it's a hard time.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.040]   You know, because of this global warming, I probably should have gotten a ragtime.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.720]   I wasn't that confident.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:15.920]   Now I know.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.520]   JerryPornell.com, you can read that and more there.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:25.920]   And Jerry, we're so honored that you join us and we're just thrilled by your writing,
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.680]   your presence, your stories and your commentary.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.760]   It's just always a pleasure to have you on.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:32.760]   Thanks.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.280]   We'll have you back soon if you don't mind.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.680]   I would love it.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:37.680]   Good.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:42.560]   Paul Thorett is, of course, of the SuperSight for Windows.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.200]   WinSuperSight.com.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.960]   He's author of the book that Jerry hasn't read.
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.600]   The one book that Jerry hasn't received a copy of, hasn't read, never heard of.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.040]   By the way, you asked Jerry who publishes it.
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.040]   It's Wiley and Sons.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.040]   You've heard of them.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.040]   Yeah, of course.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.320]   They used to send me review copies.
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.360]   I don't know why they didn't send that one.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:05.040]   Paul, I think a call to the editor is in the order here.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.200]   I love my people, call your people, keep busy.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.600]   It's a good, take it for me.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:10.680]   I'll give you my review.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.680]   I love it.
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.600]   I've read it, cover to cover.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.240]   And it makes me love Windows 7 even more.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.880]   It's called Windows 7 Secrets.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:17.880]   Yes.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.000]   I love letter to Windows 7.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   Right.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   That's pretty much what it is.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   Paul Thorett.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   It's a love letter.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   That's right.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   Yes.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   It's a chick lit kind of a book.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   It is.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   Actually, it's for women.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.120]   Many people think that, you know, the hidden part of the PC market.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.120]   Yes.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.840]   It is the Windows 7 book that ladies like best.
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.120]   Mr. Dwight Silverberg, Silverman.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.640]   I don't know what your name.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.160]   I was thinking of Silver, Robert Silver.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.160]   It's another story.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160]   It's science fiction.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.800]   Science fiction night, it is.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.560]   Just always thrilled to have you on.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.480]   And I'm glad to have somebody of my own age on the show.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:54.480]   That's right.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:55.560]   We're the same age as of today.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.520]   We just found out, yeah.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.000]   If you want to, can I plug my other radio show, which I don't think I've ever done before?
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.600]   I didn't know you did another radio show.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:11.480]   On Wednesday nights on KPFT in Houston, I'm part of a show called Technology Bites.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:17.040]   It's a two hour public radio call in and get your computer fixed show.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.320]   It's been on the air for almost, I think, almost 16 years now.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320]   Wow.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.320]   That's almost as long as I've been on it.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.320]   16 years.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.320]   Really?
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320]   It's a great show.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.400]   GeekRadio.com is the website.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.720]   It starts at eight o'clock central time.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.760]   The main host is Jay Lee, and he's always giving me grief for being on your show.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.040]   It's like, "Oh, you're going to go on that other show."
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.800]   Well, you're not on the tech guy show, so it's okay.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.800]   That's right.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:47.800]   So I just wanted to give a shout out.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.480]   If you enjoy listening, check us out on Wednesday nights.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.480]   And it's a podcast, too.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.480]   You can get that at it.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.480]   It is a podcast.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:56.480]   GeekRadio.com.
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:04.480]   And of course, Dwight writes the great tech blog at the Houston Chronicle that's blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.480]   And it is a must read.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:08.840]   In fact, I steal many of our stories from the tech blogs link role every week.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:11.040]   So they're there for you, Leo.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.040]   Thank you.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.040]   Thank you.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:14.400]   Hey, we're very excited.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.520]   We are now doing video of the show, not only the streaming video we've been doing for a year
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.440]   and a half at Twit Live, which is live.twit.tv.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:30.440]   Thanks to the folks at MediaFly, we are now coming at you on your Android phones, on
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.600]   your BlackBerry, on the Roku box, too.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.720]   If you've got a Roku check for an update, you can add the Twit channel and see this show
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.440]   and this week in Google.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.040]   Oh, finally, I did this.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.440]   Windows Weekly is on there.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.880]   I looked at our podcast on -- It looks good.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.800]   What do you think?
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.440]   I think it's pretty cool.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.040]   My son said my friend was, "Oh, Mr. TV star."
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:55.360]   You know, kids.
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.360]   He was so impressed, you know.
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.280]   No, on the big screen, it looks good.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.960]   We do a very high quality version for the Roku box.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.800]   So you get -- It's not quite HD, but it's very good.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:05.800]   Very nice.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.880]   And you see, that's why I have flowers today because we're trying to dress the setup a
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:09.880]   little bit.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:10.880]   You're trying to dress the set up a little bit.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.280]   Yes, it's -- Make it look really detracts from the rest of the --
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.280]   I know.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.280]   It's very distracting.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.080]   No, that's from my chat room for my birthday.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.080]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.880]   So, yeah, get your Roku box and you can watch us now.
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.520]   And streaming is coming to that at some point.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.360]   I'm not sure exactly when, but we're getting streaming on that as well.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.640]   So -- And if you want to watch us do this live, we do it every Sunday at 6 p.m.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:37.320]   Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific on live.twit.tv.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:38.480]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:39.480]   Really a great show.
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.480]   Really a lot of fun.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:41.480]   Thank you for watching.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:42.480]   We'll see you next time.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.720]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:50.720]   [Music]
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:41:05.720]   [Music]
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.720]   Alright.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:09.300]   (upbeat music)
