[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460]   This Week in Tech, Episode 4 May 8th 2005
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.060]   The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.360]   And it looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon sport on this, the 127th, up on Class
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.840]   Twitter the Year Show
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.600]   And now for something completely different
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.080]   We are all Twitch now
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.240]   What a great win!
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.240]   Excellent
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.800]   Yeah, alright ladies and gentlemen, this is it the Mother's Day edition of...
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.800]   Twitch this Week in Technology and with me the head twix, Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Robert
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   Aaron, Yoshi's in the anti-room trying to get his system working today.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   We're using Team Speak to talk and I don't know how that's going to work, Apple will try it.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   If it works well, we may be able to take life calls.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   Hello gentlemen.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.800]   Hello, hello.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.800]   Why aren't you with your mothers?
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800]   My mother's 27, I'm all the way.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800]   I tried Dan who?
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   We tried to get Dan...
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   We tried to get Phufu to join us and he was on I am and I started typing at him and he
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.080]   came back, this is not Dan, it's Dan's mother.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.520]   So I guess Dan is with his mother right now.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.960]   Roger Chang also had a big off today because he's with his mom.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.280]   I don't know what the Vorax excuse is but anyway with the four of us are here and that's
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280]   all that matters.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.280]   Was it a good week for you guys?
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.720]   Vorax has a mother.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.160]   Everyone has a mom somewhere, even to Vorax.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.560]   We've got lots of questions people have been sending in to this week in tech.com.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.840]   Let me give you some new email addresses as long as we're talking here.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.560]   Of course the site is up this week in tech.com and the email address is for questions, questions
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.080]   at thisweekintech.com.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.840]   You can send us your logo ideas, we're still collecting those at logos at thisweekintech.com
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.640]   and of course I'm Leo at thisweekintech.com and they're all who they are at thisweekintech.com.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.160]   Hey we want to thank all of you who have subscribed by the way and I'm very happy to
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.600]   say that we had our 1000th subscriber in less than a week.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.560]   1000th subscriber was on Saturday and it was Joseph Jan of San Diego, California.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.720]   Thank you to everyone who subscribed and we thought we'd honor Joseph as our 1000th.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.160]   We're going to give him a total bit headphone amp from Headroom.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.920]   The great guys at Headroom have donated a number of these for us.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.720]   You use these bit head amps I know before Patrick.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   I love them.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   This is their new one.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.800]   It has a USB connector so you can use it with your computer as well as your iPod and
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.640]   it's battery power but also can be powered by the USB connector.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.000]   $200 value.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.720]   Joseph, congratulations and thank you for subscribing.

[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   Do you have a good week Kevin Rose?
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.080]   You still working on that show?
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.480]   Yeah, yeah still working on the show.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.720]   It was a pretty good week, pretty relaxing.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.240]   Came across some pretty interesting news articles though.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.600]   I wanted to bring to your guys the attention.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   What's happening?
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.240]   First one I thought was really interesting was the spyware.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.160]   Did you guys happen to see this about the Symantec released a study based on spyware
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.520]   firms are now targeting children?
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.320]   How do they know they're targeting children?
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320]   I don't understand.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.280]   What do you mean they're doing it on children's websites or?
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280]   No, it's very young.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   It's a pornography video.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.800]   I like six year olds.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.280]   No, they took a few different PCs out there and they put them out on the web and they're
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.000]   allowing they basically spent, went to five or six different websites that were aimed
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.680]   at kids and they clicked around like any kid would you know different links various different
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.680]   pop-ups and after just a few hours they had 359 different pieces of adware that were installed.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.320]   Now I don't like using Internet Explorer.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.440]   I have a feeling most of stuff probably comes through a lot of the active ex pop-ups that
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.680]   you see that try installing your machine.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.280]   Well the problem is kids, I know this is true of my kids, they just click yes, yes, yes.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.640]   Henry came in this morning and said dad I won $100,000.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   I said Henry you didn't win $100,000.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.840]   I said Scam, he said no, I did, it said I did.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.320]   How do you know I didn't?
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.720]   And how do you explain that to a kid?
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.840]   You know, no you didn't, they're ripping you off.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.480]   Is this spyware that's targeted as children or is it just the same spyware you find everywhere
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.040]   else that they're hosting on children?
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.480]   I mean, I don't know if this is particularly new because it seems like a lot of the spyware
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.240]   is for lack of a less charitable phrase I can say without using expletives.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.480]   But it seems like they're just, they post it on any server they can for distribution.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.480]   Right.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   Well and also self-serving.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.760]   Right, but I think the thing here is that the reason that they're going after kids is
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.040]   that when the kids are more apt to pick on this stuff without having to, you know, think
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.480]   about it or ask a friend or something like that.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.320]   And they're getting it on mom and dad's computer.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.320]   I know, I know.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.640]   Through the kid, that's the whole point is that this is a way to get to mom and dad's
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   computer.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.440]   I don't know if they want the kids, it's just easier to get.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440]   Well, right.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.720]   Yeah, but I mean, I've cleared off two people's systems in the last month.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.240]   You know, one of them had like 200 pieces of the spyware.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.720]   See this, they had no idea what they were getting into and their machine basically wasn't
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   running.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.520]   And I just cleared another machine last week and they had a bunch of really nasty viruses.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.600]   They picked up over worms actually.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.760]   They picked up off of a peer-to-peer trading site.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.800]   And the other thing was there's just a ton of spyware.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.360]   And it was being run by adults that were running anti-spyware.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.560]   They just hadn't updated it in eight and a half months.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   Right.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   Right.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   Well, here's the question.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.760]   Is Kazah spyware or not?
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.600]   You know, Microsoft's anti-spyware program gives you a warning.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.400]   Now of course, Kazah by itself is not spyware, but it's a conduit.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   Right.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   So is it, I mean, so...
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.120]   Well, it's adware though.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   It is adware.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.320]   But you have to pay applications.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.560]   I feel they're made for moving files around.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   What those files are, it could be anything.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   Player left.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.920]   And if you're going to be using those applications, you have to take a certain precaution to, you
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.720]   know, take a look at the file you just downloaded and really carefully read any, hopefully,
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.800]   hidden somewhere in the EULA they'll have the, uh, saying yes, we are going to install
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   something or not.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   But some websites...
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.720]   Well, see, that's the thing that create crafted dialogues though that look so suspiciously
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.640]   it's like you have to hit cancel and when you normally would hit OK on a certain button.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.320]   And those type of deceptive pop-ups are just some of the worst.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.400]   Well, you know, that's what Symantec was saying right here.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.000]   They said that kids are targeted because they're very easy to manipulate and they see the video
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   game cheat codes.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.320]   They click on stuff like that and then all of a sudden they have to know where that is
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.560]   then not really going after the targeted kids, but it's popping up ads for mom and dad later
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.560]   when they get on the machine.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.360]   Yeah, they're going after you though.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.160]   Hey, I got something scary for you.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.360]   If you're a tiger user, as I know you are a new tiger user, Kevin.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   Did you see this article?
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   Yes.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.960]   Malicious applets can install dashboard widgets on tiger, malicious web pages.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.480]   You can go there and they'll install these new dashboard widgets.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.040]   That could be a problem.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   Huh.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.880]   Safari on OS 10.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880]   It's a little scary.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880]   I mean, we've said for a...
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.600]   I've been saying for a long time, "Oh, you don't have to worry about Macintosh.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.880]   You're safe."
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.680]   But this is a huge hole that Apple just basically installed on everybody's system.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680]   If you go...
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   I'll put a...
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.920]   There's a link on slash.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.760]   Stephen.com/widgetzzaptastic.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:06.240]   If you go there on a Macintosh, it installs the widget and just did it on my system.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.440]   And the thing is, the way widgets work, they are installed automatically.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.240]   Now this one's not malicious, but it's a good demonstration of the fact that it works.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   Right.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.240]   Have you read the essay?
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   Say again?
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.680]   Have you read the essay that's up on the website that installs the widget?
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.760]   The Zaptastic Blueprint for Widget of Mass Destruction.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.000]   Skip aside the Bainbridge and the Oppenheimer quotes from the Trinity test.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   But he's basically pointing out that this has opened up...
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.440]   The first time it's really opened up a really nasty security hole in OS 10.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   Yeah, I think it's really...
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.440]   It's really nasty because I know with some of these other different widget programs like
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.880]   Confabulator, it was just a variation of JavaScript, right?
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.760]   I mean, can it really do that much damage?
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   Yes, of course.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.760]   Well, he says it can't do...
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   Well, no.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.120]   Well, he's saying the widgets can't do much damage because they're sandboxed, but he goes,
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.720]   "What's interesting is you can't remove the widget once it's installed.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   There's no way.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.440]   If you can't remove it, there's no way to remove the widget from the widget bar or change their
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   order."
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.680]   So what if this widget, the icon of it is a casino or a porn site and you click on it
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.800]   and it brings you to the porn site?
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.840]   I mean, that's spyware.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.360]   That's exactly what's happening on the window side that's spyware.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.760]   So I think this is in fact an exploit that is something significant that shouldn't be
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.240]   ignored.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.840]   I think Apple's got to fix it.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.640]   And it's kind of disappointing that it exists.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.040]   I've got now green zap all over my desktop.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.040]   I don't want it.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:42.680]   Well, you can if you can find your library/wigget so you can delete the widget you don't want
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   in there.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   Right.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   Yeah, I'm just going to know what you're doing.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   That seems like an awfully easy exploit too.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.520]   I think that makes it really scary.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.640]   I went to the website.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.640]   I didn't click anything.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.160]   I'm just sitting on the website and the widget installs.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.320]   That's a very scary exploit.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.720]   I think that's a real problem.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.320]   Well, I mean, we couldn't have seen those like a rotating hard drive that just shows it
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   being deleted even though nothing's really happening.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.320]   But it's totally fine.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320]   There you go.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   There you go.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.120]   Right there.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.960]   Or, you know, I mean, exactly.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.780]   So I think that this, it's too bad because Apple has up to now been pretty good about
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.360]   protecting its users.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.880]   And this hole is not, I think that's a bad thing.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.240]   That's the one advantage Apple had against Windows was that they had this kind of secure
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.440]   environment and now it's not there anymore.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.360]   Apple actually buy the widget technology or that type of interface from the confabulator
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   folks.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.840]   No, in fact, that's a point of, that's like they developed on their end.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.440]   Yeah, that's a bone of contention from the confabulator folks.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.640]   They were kind of bitter about it.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.600]   Arlo Rose, remember we had him on the screen savers.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.040]   He made a little looking Leo widget.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.680]   And I love confabulator.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.360]   They made a Windows version and it's just a great product.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   Apple stole it basically.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.600]   Lock's not here right now.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.880]   And Dashboard is confabulator.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.320]   Frankly, I don't think it's as good as confabulator, but it's JavaScript.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.280]   It's very similar in the construction and the overall idea.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.000]   And stole is such a harsh word.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.840]   All right, let me not use the word stole because that's accusing them of something that could
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:12.440]   be not exactly, I don't want to get sued for libel on our third podcast.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   But.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.440]   No, I hear you.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.040]   And you don't want to get your boat stick.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.840]   Apple air apple striking.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.960]   They, you know, it's they basically borrowed a number of things in a way that's good.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   Isn't that what happens with operating system development?
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.440]   Don't you think Microsoft's now looking at Tiger saying what can we put in Longhorn?
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.880]   I think Microsoft at this point is trying to figure out how can we finish Longhorn and
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.240]   ship it because they've just been slashing and burning.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.240]   Features.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.560]   They've been cutting features out of Longhorn at this point.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.280]   It's still forever in a day away.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   Good point.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   Yep.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.280]   Good point.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.760]   I'd like to see Microsoft at some point just create an interface for their operating system.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.440]   That lets you customize it to your heart's content very easily.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.600]   We don't have to download third party apps to make it, you know, give it the flavor you
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   like in particular.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.440]   A couple of Google stories with the original plus packs.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   Right.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.280]   40 bucks more and you can have a great screensaver of fish.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.120]   Nothing wrong with the farming ones.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.040]   That makes you feel right at home.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   Doesn't bad.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.560]   Hey, did you guys notice a couple of big Google stories in the news?
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.280]   One Google was down yesterday for about four hours and for a while as being referred.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.240]   It was being referred to a site, SOGO site, which is apparently a New York marketing
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.520]   firm that has Google.net.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.600]   I say, or googled.com.net, I think they own.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.720]   Google says it wasn't a hack.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.160]   It was a DNS error, but I was shocked.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.400]   I mean, to go to Google and get a 404 is shocking.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   Don't you think?
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.560]   That's pretty scary.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.200]   I felt like I couldn't, I felt a debilitated.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.040]   I can't use the net.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.680]   It just showed Google has become so important to using them.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.480]   I didn't think of going to MSN search or Yahoo.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   I left.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.480]   I did something else.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.080]   That always makes me think of when you type in the ping command, it's like you're paying
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.560]   east to be Yahoo.com.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.040]   Now, eventually I see all the IT guys using ping Google.com.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.040]   Are they pinging Google now?
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.400]   Because I still ping Yahoo.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.480]   I still ping Yahoo.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   Who here pings Yahoo?
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   Who pings Google?
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   I ping Yahoo.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   I ping Yahoo.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   I ping Yahoo.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   I ping Yahoo.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   I ping Yahoo.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   I ping Yahoo.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.480]   I ping Yahoo.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   I ping Yahoo.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.120]   I'm not surprised at Google whatever go down.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   Has anybody tried the Google, the new Google Web Accelerator?
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.120]   I'm going to talk to all the stories.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.120]   I've tried it.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   I don't know.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.520]   They've run into a lot of issues that I've heard of.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.960]   They pulled it from Google.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960]   You can't download it any longer.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   Oh, did they?
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.680]   Well, I'll tell you, initially my initial reaction was it doesn't seem to speed things
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.080]   up much and I can no longer edit my wiki.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.840]   I can no longer edit my web page.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.880]   The caching screwed up things apparently saving from a web page.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.760]   Did you hear about the story about some people were logged into other people's user accounts
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.480]   because of the caching them already being logged in?
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   Oh, interesting.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   Really?
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.280]   Well, it was a good idea and it's dead.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280]   That's scary.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.280]   It's dead now.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.800]   And privacy advocates, of course, worried about the whole notion of saving web pages
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   on the Google servers.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.160]   You know, it's something that makes sense maybe for your internet service provider to
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.920]   do, to cache web pages because you have a direct connect to them.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.160]   I'm not sure I understood the value of having Google do it.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.200]   Are there servers so much faster that we're going to benefit?
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   No, please.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   Just give me 20 megabit connection.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.360]   It needs to be just a matter of level.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.200]   Anything else you want?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.240]   It's really tricky too.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.320]   Faster internet cheaper.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.000]   Well, we pay more in this country than web accelerator technology.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.320]   We pay more now for internet access in this country than almost any other country.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   Well, no, that's not true.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.680]   Most industrial nations, oddly enough, for a long time we had the deal, but now it's
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.400]   gotten so cheap in most other nations in the West that we're paying more than most.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   Really?
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.400]   Yeah, isn't that weird?
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   You wouldn't fear so.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.040]   Open the cell companies kick in and deploy their high speed wireless networks so we can
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.640]   eventually or maybe Wi-Fi will just take everything over.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.160]   Wi-Fi is not going to take everything over because you still need a DSLR cable connection
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   at the end.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.200]   I mean, it's interesting because like, sorry, I've been thinking a lot about this because
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.480]   we're launching a new YMAX site at extremetech.com.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.760]   But it's interesting because YMAX has all this potential, at least for metropolitan areas,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   if it ever ships.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:25.080]   And it's the idea of just better than cable or DSL speeds, wireless, no line of site
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.880]   issues, but it still comes down to be nice if the phone companies get it, but the phone
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.280]   companies can't decide how much they want to charge everybody.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.640]   They're either going to charge you 80 bucks a month to access it over your phone or they're
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   going to charge you nothing for three-year 4G bandwidth.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.720]   It's like they can't decide on how much money they want to make.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.560]   They just checked the Google Web Accelerators site and says we have currently reached our
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.520]   maximum capacity of users and are actively working to increase the number of users we
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.520]   can support.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.400]   So the Web Accelerator is ostensibly still up, but they've maxed out.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.400]   That's their claim.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.400]   We can't support it.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   Right.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   Well, that's what they say.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   I don't know.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   I can't use anymore.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   Hey, I saw that Seattle is putting speed easy.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.120]   I've put a finite number of servers for it.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   Well, that was the whole point.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.760]   I don't understand why they're even getting in this business.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   What is the percentage for Google?
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.080]   To go back to the YMAX thing, I saw that the speak easy, which is the big Seattle internet
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.360]   service providers, they're putting YMAX on the Space Needle.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.960]   They're putting pre-YMAX on the Space Needle and actually a week or two ago Intel was playing
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.360]   around with pre-YMAX or some of their YMAX technology on the stratosphere in Vegas and
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.160]   claiming they were covering 500 square miles off the boat.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.160]   Holy cow.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.080]   I mean, the YMAX is a huge...
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.600]   Well, it's an interesting idea.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.320]   I'm kind of looking forward to getting the chance to talk to some of the geeks that are
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.600]   involved running it because if you can really cover, I mean, San Francisco is kind of a
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.600]   wireless nightmare because all the hills and nooks and crannies, but the idea is that
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.520]   it's going to be microwave, it's going to be non-line a site, you're going to be able
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.280]   to go through building walls.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:03.120]   They're first going to roll out in static, non-moving locations first, fixed locations
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.840]   as a competitor to cable and DSL, which is a really nice way of not having to fight
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.320]   with the phone company and not having to deal with the cable company, which has a certain
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.760]   definite attraction to me.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.760]   You know what bugs me though?
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.520]   It's just another high-speed internet for the urban dweller who already has, in most
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.880]   cases, at least two choices.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.160]   What it really could be used in rural areas to wire people who are completely disenfranchised,
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.960]   like the best they can do is a 28-8 modem.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.200]   YMAX could be used to cover rural areas, I mean, because you're still, it's going to
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.280]   be concentrated in basically town, right?
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.160]   And town's a lot smaller than the top 100 metropolitan markets, but what's interesting,
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   what's much, much more threatening is what Verizon started in Pennsylvania, which is
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:58.240]   getting state legislatures passing laws that prevent local communities from establishing
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.160]   their own ISPs, which is what Philadelphia was doing.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.000]   Because, you know, most of Philadelphia doesn't have access to broadband, and they started
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.600]   a project to bring municipal wireless, and Verizon went nuts and ended up getting a law
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.400]   passed from the state legislature in Pennsylvania, preventing any other community in Pennsylvania
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   from doing that.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   Was it just Verizon?
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   I think it was just Verizon.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.000]   It was just Verizon, because isn't Philadelphia the home of--
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.120]   Verizon's Comcast, and you'd think they would have wired the damn town.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.120]   It was Verizon.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.000]   Well, Verizon was the big push behind that effort.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Interesting.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.280]   Well, and of course they grandfathered in Philadelphia, but yeah, the rest of Pennsylvania's had
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.840]   a lot, and I think that's terrible, criminal.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.800]   People want to go up and up and be up in arms over that.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.200]   What else is on the top of your mind?
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   Robert Herron, what are you thinking about these days?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.880]   Well, I was just thinking about when you're talking about the wireless networking, and
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.800]   I was wondering why more networking companies aren't offering some sort of default mesh
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.920]   technology within the routers they sell.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.160]   So you could at least say, you know what, by default, it'll sacrifice, say, 20% of my
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.280]   bandwidth to connect to another one that would further this network and help perpetuate--
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.280]   What are you?
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.280]   Some kind of--
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.960]   Coming here, communist, Robert.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.880]   Why should I share my bandwidth with my neighbors?
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   Scrum.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.880]   No, no.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.880]   Totally voluntary.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.640]   Like, I really mind wide open, and I hope people use it.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   I do too.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   I think that--
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   It was quite a bit of a bit of a--
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   I think it is--
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.800]   Hey, I remember you just were Patrick saying that--
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   mesh was problematic.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.560]   It wasn't as wonderful as everybody's been saying.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.680]   Well, mesh has changed a lot in the last two years, because mesh has gone from--
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.120]   The mesh routers we were looking at were open source based routers that were primarily
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.160]   being used in England to do exactly what you were just talking about, Robert, is to
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.280]   extend the network to places where people couldn't get it.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.080]   There's a lot of overhead, and there was a lot of--
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.280]   There's a lot-- mostly there's just a lot of overhead, and you ended up-- you could
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.760]   really get your bandwidth hammered on if you happen to be the last connection to broadband
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.600]   standing.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.760]   But there's mesh networks--
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.760]   You don't see two of those.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.760]   --that's what you're doing.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.080]   I was going to say it also seems that it's proprietary whenever you come across any mesh
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   technology.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.680]   It's our particular formula of how we want to do it, and we're not going to make it compatible
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   with anything else.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   So hopefully mesh is mostly--
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.400]   Well, partially mesh is mostly slow.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.480]   You're showing up in low latency environments, like if you look at Zigbee, where you're talking
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.160]   about low speed, low latency--
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.080]   You have no-- excuse me-- high latency.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.800]   You don't care about latency like you're turning on all the lights in an office building or
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.360]   waiting for the temperature to be sent back from a remote sensor, and that's what Zigbee's
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.560]   doing and a couple other competing technologies.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.520]   The mesh works out really great, because it's healing, it's self-configuring.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.520]   It monitors itself.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.440]   It can be incredibly low power.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.960]   When you're talking about broadband speeds, mesh gets really complicated, especially if
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.200]   you're trying to keep the latency down.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.000]   I thought there was a source forged project, actually, now that I'm thinking about this
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.680]   little more, where they had a list of firmware upgradeable routers where you could actually
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.200]   go ahead and enable programs within the router itself, run a small Linux app, basically,
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.800]   that would enable a mesh technology in several of the popular, just off the shelf routers.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.240]   I'm trying to remember-- I should look that up next time.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.160]   Actually, there was also a really cool firmware that allowed you to create your own hotspot.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.160]   Remember that?
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.840]   You put that in the links and you have a little hotspot.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.200]   This is something you might like, Patrick.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.120]   Somebody's come up with a Wi-Fi surfboard.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.120]   I think it's--
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.960]   It's a key demonstration on the--
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   Maybe she did.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.760]   I don't know, it's from England.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.680]   You have to have a base station on the beach.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.840]   Maybe it would support Wi-Macs.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   I don't know.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   Maybe it's mesh.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.680]   Oh, I saw this one where it's got the browser embedded in the face of the--
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.480]   It's got the LCDN to the surfboard.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   Exactly.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   Intel built it.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   They're showing it off.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   They're going to show it off at the Ocean Fest, an 18th of June in Devon, England.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.160]   Is there much surfing in North Devon?
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   Apparently there is.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.800]   It's the UK's surf repair device.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.080]   I can't imagine it's much of a paradise, but OK.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.080]   Maybe some of our--
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.040]   Well, it's kind of like surfing in Northern California or Oregon.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   It's cold.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   It is cold.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.520]   In Wetsuit as required.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.400]   Any other stories before we get to our questions from our listeners?
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.840]   Oh, I got one.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   Hi, guys.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.680]   There's about 55 days left until the broadcast flag comes into play.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.640]   I was wondering what your opinions are of the broadcast flag and how that's going to
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.600]   play out in the industry and for consumers like me.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.400]   The broadcast flag.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   It's over.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   The broadcast flag is dead.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.320]   Well, is the XCC going to appeal that decision?
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   You bet.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   They're going all the way to the Supreme Court.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   You don't think so?
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.800]   You think they're going to fly that?
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   Not at all.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.080]   They want to outlaw every piece of hardware that's been sold.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.240]   I guess it would not lock what you currently own, but suddenly every broadcast, every receiver
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.840]   out there that could accept say, and over the Air HD signal, you're going to suddenly
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.480]   make that illegal even owned or resell in some way.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.480]   You have to put it--
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.920]   Unless it has copy protection built in, it has to have the broadcast flag or it's illegal.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.880]   But everything up to this point, especially on the PC side, just simply ignores the broadcast
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   flag.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   It ignores it outright.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:24.280]   So I just think the FDC says, how can we possibly go back at this point after we've
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.600]   let it out of the box?
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.280]   Well, just between us kids, when we had Michael Powell, the former chairman of the SCC on the
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.160]   screensavers about a year ago, he said, just between you and me, we didn't have any choice.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   We had to do it.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.120]   The movie companies were asking for a lot more.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.640]   He said, but just between you and me, Leo, you know this will never stand.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.160]   I don't know whether he knew that the courts would throw it out or he thought it would
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.360]   be hacked.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.120]   But he felt like it wasn't anything to worry about even then because it wasn't going to
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   get implemented.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.320]   So maybe he was prescient.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.000]   Maybe he knew this would happen.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.160]   And maybe the FCC doesn't really have the will.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.160]   Maybe they're glad to see this happen.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.640]   And of course, the Motion Picture Association of America immediately responded saying, well,
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.640]   that's it.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.960]   We're not going to put any good movies on around HDTV broadcast.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.840]   You can say goodbye to that.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   We're taking our ball down.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   That's true.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.160]   We're not that we're through.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.840]   You know, I don't care how much money you throw at us.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   How much?
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.160]   I would hope and oh, never mind.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.360]   I would hope it sounds like this.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.760]   You might have actually talked to a nonpartisan video engineer broadcast engineer who said,
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.560]   look, no matter what you come up with, at some point it will be hacked and there and
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.840]   especially on the PC side of things, you will always be able to redirect that output to
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:43.400]   either a different out, to a fully full blown port, like something like DVI or through
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.840]   Firewire or it's just, oh.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:52.320]   It's probably one of the cable industry association meeting a couple weeks ago.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.560]   One of the engineers on the download just said, you know what, even Microsoft has fully
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.960]   acknowledged that every piece of video technology they have out there can be cracked and they
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.680]   expect it not simply if but when.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:08.120]   Look how fast the bunny cracked the Xbox which had the best content and make it cheaper
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.120]   for everyone to agree.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.440]   It seems like they're going about the wrong way of this.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.760]   I mean, if you think that I'm seriously considering canceling my cable altogether because with
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.960]   RSS wrapping all these bit torrent files, I can subscribe to different channels, tell
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:26.440]   the content that I want and I have my own little built in TV right on my PC and as there
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.520]   is just go down downloads everything for me automatically.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.280]   Who was it was it Battlestar Galactica that they started offering a bit torrents of their
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.240]   show like the day after the show aired or maybe even the day before the show aired.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   Somebody's doing that.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   Yeah they did.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   I think that's amazing.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.680]   But you know what, I prefer honestly downloading shows from overseas like especially the broadcast
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.920]   out of Europe and in particular England because they don't use all of those pop up graphics
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.000]   during a broadcast now that people are channel skipping through the commercials or I mean
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.920]   commercial skipping through their favorite programs, they're now introducing new forms
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.080]   of advertising while you're actually watching the show itself where you have the bottom
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.480]   third, something going up the right hand side that just totally takes me out of the moment
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.720]   when I'm watching my favorite shows and if I have to go see if the download a relatively
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.160]   clean looking version of that show so be it.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.240]   I think that the beginning of the end frankly for broadcast media between the podcasts and
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.760]   MP3 players killing radio, bit torrents killing television.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:30.560]   The question is who's going to continue to make premium content expensive things if they
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560]   can't make the money back.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.320]   I mean how do they make the money back?
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.120]   It should all be premium.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   I like it.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.120]   I like having no advertising.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   I'll pay for it if there's no advertising.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.280]   I mean I pay for cable.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:46.480]   I pay for my 70, 80, 150 channels and I still am bombarded with advertising left and right
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.720]   to the point where I'm trying to actively skip using every piece of technology I can.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   It's frustrating.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.120]   I actually know into it.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   You're absolutely right the rubber.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   I think it's going to go to kind of like a you just choose the content that you want
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.120]   at the time.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.200]   You'll buy the certain channels or the certain types of content that you want and it works
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   that way already.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.800]   If you take a look at the way that BitTorrent's working I can download a file before it even
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.960]   airs on the west coast.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.400]   It will have aired on the east coast.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.000]   Someone will BitTorrent put it online.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   I'll download it.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.440]   I'll have it and be able to watch it in HD before it even broadcasts out here on the west coast.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.800]   It takes like Battle Star Galaxica that broadcasted in Europe about three months before it came
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   here.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:31.240]   I could actually cheat and get the whole season ahead of time in HD and go to it perfectly.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.680]   With no commercial interruptions, no weird lower third graphics.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   How big are those files?
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.960]   If they're HD are they divics and how big are they?
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.240]   The current goal right now everyone is shooting at 350 megabytes per hour long show.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.160]   You can put two hours on a single CD which I'll be honest.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   They're using an end pass and coding, multiple passing codes and they make them look beautiful.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.320]   They do a really really good job.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.880]   You're not sacrificing quality by doing that relative analysis.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.600]   My biggest complaint though, this goes to TV and everything.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:08.440]   They just simply don't offer an option to not have that additional advertising.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.200]   I would honestly pay a little bit more to avoid all that.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   I'd give the profit straight to whoever the provider is.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.640]   I think that's what we're doing.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.320]   This is the experiment that we're trying.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.200]   Are people willing to hear what we have to say and pay a little bit?
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.320]   We're giving it for free but asking them to pay a little bit.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.520]   So far I've been very gratified by the response.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.760]   It's certainly not 100%.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.960]   It's probably one in 100 but those one in 100 are supporting the show.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   I think that's great.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.760]   You have to start somewhere.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.760]   Yoshi is a...
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.760]   You're from other 99.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.760]   That's actually...
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.760]   Is he back?
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760]   I think Yoshi's back.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760]   Time to hop in there.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   Yay!
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.960]   Thanks to gentlemen.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.040]   It's the Mod Master himself.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.560]   What you've been up to these days, Yoshi?
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.560]   We miss you.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.400]   I've missed you guys too.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   I've done this stuff.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   I've been up to a lot.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.920]   I've been doing a little bit of modding.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.200]   Been trying to get my head up.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.840]   That's been taking me for a day.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.160]   I did that stuff with those guys from the shadows.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.520]   I've done a couple more things.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.680]   I helped them out with the basically the range testing and all that for that first episode
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.360]   and for this next one where I've come with up I did some good mod for it.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.960]   Do a stuff like that for fun.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.240]   I was going to be moving or see if that's still going to happen.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   That might have actually fallen through.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   I wasn't going to be going to Dallas but I'm not sure if I still will.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.000]   Oh, there's a lot of people in Dallas who just got their hopes up in one of my hat.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.200]   All hat, no cattle, right?
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.600]   Well, what I was going to do there kind of fell through so I might not be doing that.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.760]   Well, maybe you'll be doing this.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.160]   We'd love to have you here on a regular basis.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.160]   Yeah, I'm doing this.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   Great.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   Personally, I'm actually...
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   I'll announce it on here.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.360]   I am getting married soon and I seem to be a father.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.360]   Congratulations.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   Wow.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.360]   Yeah, Yoshi, that's great.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.360]   What's...
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.040]   So, can you tell us who the lucky lady is?
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   You want to...
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.760]   Don't say her whole name and we don't want to expose her too quickly to this.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.160]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   Well, congratulations to you, Kerry.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.360]   Kerry, she's been pretty much the best thing that's ever happened.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.360]   So, it's pretty cool.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.360]   Well, Yoshi, that's...
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.960]   And everyone that's around me has told me that they've seen a visible change in me.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:18.480]   As all of us here will testify, there's nothing like a good woman to tame a bad man.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.280]   I sound like a Johnny Cash song, isn't it?
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   No, no, no.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.280]   Hey, I want to mention...
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.880]   I want to mention that Meghan was going to...
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   What's going to spill?
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.880]   I want to ask you a question.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.920]   I want to mention that Meghan was going to join us.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.160]   Meghan Moroni, another longtime friend of ours and a screensaver.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   And it is Mother's Day, her mother's in town, so she couldn't make it.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.400]   But she'll come in sometime soon.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.840]   You know she had twin boys a month ago, Huck and Milo, and they're just adorable.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.880]   Yeah, just empty out her jumping monkeys.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.600]   Just empty out her jumping monkeys mailbox.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.520]   You've said her email baron had bounced.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.160]   Oh, she's got quite a bit, I'm sure.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   Well, I had dinner with her on Friday night.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.480]   She and her husband and the three kids, they had an instant family, came over and it was
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.960]   so great and her mom too.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   And so she wishes you all the best.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.200]   She's just doing great, she's very happy.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.280]   And we expect to get her in here doing the show very soon.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.560]   So that's good news too.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.680]   So I think we've got a pretty complete reunion here.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   We're working on it.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.200]   There are a few people missing and I've sent them all emails.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.520]   But we might be able to kind of recreate the screensavers.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.520]   I mean the, you know...
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.160]   I think one by one we'll drag them back at.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.960]   That show we used to do.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.960]   Let's take some questions.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.200]   You're going to have to bleep that, Leo.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   I'll bleep it.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   Damn it.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   Let's take...
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.680]   I've got to bleep that too.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   I've got to bleep that.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.760]   Never ending and that too and that.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.440]   Here's a question from Brian for all of us.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.440]   Listen up.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:50.120]   Hey guys, I was a ZDTV and tech TV fan since like before day one.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:57.320]   Originally I found ZDTV when it was a test pattern on C-band on the old satellite C4.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.440]   I noticed that over the course of time that basically things were...
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:06.280]   I hate to use the phrase dumb down but the content became a little more simplified I
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.280]   guess.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:13.200]   The caliber of questions that once were on copper, copper help actually became more of
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.000]   the kind of questions that you had on the screensavers and the stuff.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   The really hardcore stuff that was on the screensaver sort of faded away and wasn't
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.560]   addressed.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.080]   Was this a conscious decision or was it just organic?
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:31.840]   And also is there any chance of Martin Sargent showing up?
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   Really Miss Martin.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   Not to Scott Harriet or heck even Carmine Gallo.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.480]   Leo and I got dumber over time.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   I think that's what each question.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.080]   We didn't dumb the showdown.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.080]   We dummed down.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.720]   I don't think we would intentionally did that.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   Did we?
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   I don't think so.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   Well there was a...
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.640]   There was a bit more entertaining than just pure tech.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.080]   They wanted to get away from like the super hardcore geek side and wanted to be a little
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   more general.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.080]   That did happen and that happened.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.360]   And that was a push all over the network.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.360]   And I think a mistake.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.480]   The other things we're going to do with this podcast, we're not beholden to anybody, right?
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.720]   We can make it as geeky as we want.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.160]   And I don't have any intention unless you guys do of dumbing it down.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.080]   I think we should just do what we're interested in, right?
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   Yeah, I'd say why.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   People want to hear the details.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.760]   They want, they'd always write us the emails when they were there before saying we want
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   more info.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   Right.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   We'd have to email them back and give them the info.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   TV is commercial.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.720]   I've heard that there are many and many rounds of dumbing down.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.400]   Here's the king of dumb down.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.400]   His IQ is now down about 20.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.480]   I think I'm going to go down and drive here.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.600]   But look, I don't blame, I think that's normal.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.920]   That's what broadcast television or cable television, you know, commercial television
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.520]   does.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:49.000]   It's aimed at the largest possible audience and they assume that that audience isn't
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.240]   too bright.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.520]   We need more celebrities.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.520]   Very true.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.520]   How are we waiting for you?
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   No, we don't.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520]   TV over IP.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.520]   Well, that's what's happening.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520]   It's what Kevin's working very hard.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.520]   Well, I mean, narrow casting.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.400]   But that's what print media did.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, between the 20s and the 50s, you went from the ladies
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.960]   home journal to flying magazine to these special interests, tightly focused magazines.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:14.200]   And between, you know, 500 cable channels and Robert, totally right, IPTV, I think,
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.040]   broadcast media is going to make that change.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   Oh, yeah, podcasting.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.800]   Oh, I mean, that's the big thing.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   That's the big thing right now.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.960]   It's like one of the main reasons I want to get into this space and really do this is
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.120]   that I want to be able to do the content that, you know, I enjoy, which is the super geeky
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.440]   stuff where I can get in depth as I want to.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.600]   And I control it and I control all of that, which is great.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.080]   You know, next year is going to be.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.880]   I'm going to get a new best glass.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.280]   Next year is going to be one more step toward all the cart table programming or content
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.280]   programming.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   Right.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   It's what you were asking for, Robert.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.720]   It's so much stuff on TV right now.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   It's garbage.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   Well, like, yeah, out of direct TV.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.120]   I'll, oh, you have 400 and 500 channels.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.800]   I have about two channels I'll watch.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   Right.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   I really don't watch much broadcast.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   You have television.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   I'm the same way.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.440]   It doesn't show me the information I want.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:03.040]   Well, as somebody who's been in broadcasting now, it'll be 30 years next, been a couple
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.040]   of years.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.960]   This is the most exciting development I've ever seen because broadcasting was always
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.480]   some group of small group of people deciding what to do, what was going to happen.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.440]   And, and if, you know, if they controlled the transmitter or they controlled the presses,
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.280]   they decided, well, now we all have presses and transmitters.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.400]   We can all do what we want.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.440]   And you know who gets to decide now?
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.280]   The audience gets to decide.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.520]   I think that's how it should be.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.680]   All right, I'll get off my high horse here.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.680]   Exactly.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.800]   I think it's obvious to see that, that dorky, geeky, Linux code across the screen that the
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.160]   producers would always scream about being on air too long.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   No more Linux.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.920]   What are you doing?
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.360]   That was the thing that blew me away.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.000]   When I got to Canada, they said more Linux.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Can you do more Linux?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.240]   I said, what?
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   We want more Linux.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.240]   I said, okay.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   Okay.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.400]   It is a different, this is the problem we're talking about is a US problem, primarily.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.600]   Although, it's spreading everywhere, but it's more so in the United States.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.120]   I mean, we don't have the national channels that, you know, the government funded channels.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.840]   I mean, they got the BBC in Britain where they'll do, you know, the most of some of
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.760]   my favorite podcasts are from BBC Radio.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.840]   You know, let's talk about Homer and the Aeneid and the impact of the Peloponnesian War
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.200]   on agriculture in the fifth century of the sea.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   And I love it.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.520]   I don't know what they're talking about, but I love it.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.520]   Hey, let's get another call.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.960]   Hey, guys, this is the man from Irvine Underground.org.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:36.840]   I just want to know, Patrick and Kevin, both of you have gone to DEFCON before.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.000]   And I was wondering if you guys were going to podcast live from there or not live, but
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.840]   if you were going to record the podcasts and then post them from DEFCON 13.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   When is DEFCON?
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   The last one, not to 31st.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   Who's going to DEFCON?
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   Yeah, I'm going.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   I am.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   I will be there.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:02.280]   I think there's a step there for system.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   Okay.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.880]   There's a three part, yeah, one system going to launch, by the way.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.120]   Actually, we should answer this guy's question first.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   Sorry.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   Well, I think I, you know, DEFCON 13.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.880]   Well, DEFCON 13 is still like, like Yoshi said, July 29th and 31st.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.160]   But this guy's saying, are we going to podcast in there?
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:28.000]   I'll record stuff there, but I won't go on a network pretty much anywhere in Vegas,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.080]   much less at DEFCON that during that three day period.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.560]   You think, really, don't you think there's in there no honor among hackers?
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.240]   You think you'd actually get hacked?
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:43.200]   Oh, they hacked, they hacked Kevin Mitnick and posted his name on a wall.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.240]   Basically, there's a, there's a network system inside the hotel, the resort, the Alexis
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.240]   Park where DEFCON is held, right?
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.240]   And there's a pretty good high speed broadband access there.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:58.080]   And what happens is you have all these people scanning and running every attack possible
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.040]   on every operating system.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.920]   And there's a few guys that basically sit, there's like a central area where you can
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.760]   like sit and lounge and meet and hang out with people.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.200]   And there's, they basically, they have a big overhead projector that aims at the wall,
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.280]   a projector that aims at the wall as they list as they basically rooted people's systems
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.640]   out and list their information up on the wall.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:24.120]   And it just scrolls slowly up all day long.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120]   That would be humiliating.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   So I will, I will actually connect my system to the network.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.560]   You should be not there.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:34.200]   I actually, I think it's Bluetooth, phones, whatever you're carrying with you that might
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.160]   happen to be, happen to be vulnerable.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.680]   Well, I'll tell you what, we'll set you up, Patrick, with a secure recording device that
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.400]   is not, and we'll get, and you can bring back the tapes and we'll play them on the show.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.560]   How about that?
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.520]   I can, I can, I can, I figured out some places to sneak out to where it's far enough away
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:58.080]   that like nobody, it's far enough away from the Alexis park where I feel safe.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.840]   But like I wouldn't even in any of the surrounding hotels, I wouldn't use any of their connections.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.440]   People just, well, you're paranoid that.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440]   He really is.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.280]   You ever see, you ever see something sad?
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.680]   It's like, you see some like, I'm the biggest bad ass from insert town here.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.120]   My systems are secure.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.880]   I can take down any network.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.840]   And he like plugs onto the Wi-Fi network in DEFCON and you can just watch his system get
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.040]   new and you'll see people in the hallways desperately typing on their screens.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.760]   And you know, they were like, my system is secure.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.880]   And it's like, well, guess what?
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.280]   You just learned something new, didn't just sparky.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.680]   And my notebook stays in my bag.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.680]   Oh boy.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   Can I make it be nervous?
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   My hotel room.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.680]   Well, if the hotel room is in the walking distance of DEFCON, DEFCON, I would be.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.680]   All right.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.680]   Well, we'll get to do this.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.680]   We're all going to be there at the same time.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   Let's get together.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   Let's do it.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.680]   We should.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.680]   We should have a meetup.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   DEFCON, there's a good idea.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   A meetup.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   Well, send out, for those of you who are subscribers, one of the things we do want to do is some
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.680]   meetups.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   We will send out an email to subscribers only that will reveal the season.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   It will reveal the secret location of our DEFCON meetup.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   Oh, I know the perfect location for the DEFCON one.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   Oh, cool.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   All right.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   That'll be great.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   I don't know if I'm going to be able to maybe.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.680]   I know a good place too.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.680]   But you guys sound like you're going to have a good time.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   And you must bring recording devices.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   We'll get you some recording stuff and you can do it.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   You can do the podcast there.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   That'll be really fun.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   That'll be really fun.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   All right.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   Let me see.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   We get time for one or two more questions here.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.680]   This has been great.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   I tell you.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   It's wonderful to have you Yoshi.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   And now that we've got--
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   I have to say I'm not crazy about the team speak.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   I think the latency on this is kind of an issue.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.680]   We'll have to look at some other things.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.680]   Next week--
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.680]   Well, actually, we should thank the guy whose team speaks server we're using because that was
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.680]   really cool of him to loan this to us.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.680]   Well, he's gone now.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.680]   But we talked to him earlier.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.680]   Mark Williamson, very nice of him.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   He's out of Austin.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.680]   That might be one of the reasons that we have a little bit of lag because we're all on
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   the West Coast.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   But yeah, that was very nice of him.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   He wanted to-- it shows that we can have more people.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   One of the things that team speak would allow us to do is take live calls because you could
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   log into the server and then we could invite you in and ask your question and then kick
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   you out.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.680]   So I like the idea of this.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.680]   We're going to look at some other ways.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   We're going to look at Ventrilo.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.680]   Maybe next week we'll use Ventrilo.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.680]   We can compare and contrast.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.680]   And then I'm going to work on a way to do it with asterisk and see if we can do it a little bit
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   better.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   Let's get another question in here though before we take off.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   This is John in Nashville.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   Hey guys, this is Josh from Nashville.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   I just wanted to let you know it's great to have you all back together here again.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:43.680]   And this podcast has really turned me on to podcasting in general.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   So in light of that, I'd like to ask all of you, what are some of your favorite podcasts,
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.680]   your favorite podcast software for receiving and your favorite podcast software for producing?
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   Because I'm planning on starting one when I go to college.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   Also, on a related note, what are some of your favorite MP3 players right now?
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.680]   Thanks guys.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   Okay, I hope you're taking notes.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.680]   Let's see.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.680]   Alright, first, do any of you listen to podcasts or is that kind of not something you guys
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   do?
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.680]   I do actually.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680]   What do you like Patrick?
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   I'm just starting.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   There's nothing other than the daily source.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   There's not a lot that I listen to particularly regularly.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   I kind of sample here and there because we've been basically for extremeipod.com.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   We're starting to put up more podcast listings.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.680]   I use iPodder.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   It's kind of like the original and the easy one.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   Maybe it's because I'm too lazy to...
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.680]   If you're going to use the BitTorrent feeds that we offer for this or the Evil Genius Chronicles,
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   Dave Slusher uses, iPodder X is a better choice.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.680]   It seems to work better with BitTorrent because it has it built in.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   I like iPodder X.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   I know Ray Slakansky, pardon me Ray, I can never get your name right.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   A very nice guy and he and August who writes the interface have done a really nice job.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   That's my favorite but there's a light version and a paid version.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.680]   Doppler's pretty good on Windows.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   Again, doesn't do a very good job with BitTorrent.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.680]   Have you listened Patrick to the IT conversations?
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.680]   I think that's an amazing podcast.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.680]   No, I'll check that one out.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.680]   There's a lot of them.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.680]   I think they do it almost a dozen a week.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:28.680]   What it is is a lot of its conference, panels and speeches and interviews and stuff.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.680]   It's just really high quality content.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   There's also .NET radio which is quite good.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.680]   How about you, Kevin, you listen to podcasts or is this not something you do?
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   You probably don't have a lot of time to do that.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.680]   Not much, no, but I do have iPodder X.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   It's funny because they're even starting to work with video now too moving forward.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   Right.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   So that if there's videos that you're into as long as they have the RSS enclosures,
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   you'll be able to grab the video even though if it's BitTorrent wrapped too,
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   it'll suck the BitTorrent, open it up and then save it to your hard drive.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   That's what I like about iPodder X.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.680]   It does that transparent.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   Which is going to be pretty interesting.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   Because you're going to have big files when you do system.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   Yeah, they're going to be two to three hundred makes.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   But that's the beauty of this is it goes on in the background.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   You don't really pay attention and it's just there.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   At some point it just arrives.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.680]   Exactly.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.680]   One thing I subscribe to that feed and they don't ever have to worry about checking the website.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   Right.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   One thing I don't like about iPodder X.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:24.680]   I see iPodder X is a, oh sorry iPodder X is a I is for OS 10 only.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   Right now.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   One thing I don't like about it in any of these is that they leech.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   They don't leave the BitTorrent client open.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   And I understand, I asked Ray about that and he said, "Well, we don't want people to have stuff running on their system all the time that they don't know about.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   So we didn't feel right about it.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.680]   But it would be nice if they would see it.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:47.680]   I mean the whole idea of BitTorrent is once you've got the file, leave your client open so that other people can get it as well.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   Robert, you listen to any podcasts?
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.680]   Not really.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.680]   I'd like to be able to find certain radio shows that I can't find.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   Like I got really hooked to a few radio shows in particular down in Los Angeles that aren't being broadcast up here.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.680]   And I'm hoping that they would eventually move to a podcast format.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.680]   Oh, there's always the PDP networks as well.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.680]   But the third question or the third part of that question was about, was it flash based, MP3 players?
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.680]   And I have to say, I river makes my favorite just about anything they make.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   You like the I-reverting me.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   As soon as they can come up with a five gig flash player, I'd buy it immediately.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   It's just the storage factor.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   It's hard to find them in a gig size, let alone two or three gigs of flash storage.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.680]   The I-rever is 10.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:42.680]   I mean, it's just, I don't know, I've tested three or four different models of I-rever and it seems like it's all the same guts, but the implementation in the case and the screen display kind of varies all over the map.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   That's one thing on the product really.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   So it was the FM tuner built into the I-rever products that really sold because I love listening to radio and built in voice recorder and just the shape of it that kind of like, I use the voice recorder.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   I use the voice recorder.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   I use it mostly on my cell phone.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.680]   My cell phone has one built into it, so I use that more often than I use anything else.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.680]   I think Adam Curry is using the I-rever voice recorder sometimes to do his podcast as I remember.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.680]   So I mean, the quality is pretty good on the...
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.680]   Well, if you have a good mic, I think the quality is actually pretty good. That's one downside of the iPod.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:24.680]   Even if you get the Belkin, or rather the Griffin I-Mic, the iPod won't let you record it better than 8-bit recording unless you put Linux on in which case, why did you get an iPod?
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   That's the lack of an FM tuner.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.680]   I don't mind that.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.680]   I don't like to send it to the radio once in a while.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   I don't mind that.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.680]   That's why I have one shuffle.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.680]   I have a gigabyte shuffle that's dedicated to podcasts.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.680]   It's all talk.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.680]   And yeah, I don't know what...
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.680]   Any of my Howard Stern in the morning.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.680]   There's some really...
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   What I like about podcasting, there's some interesting innovative stuff happening, which you wouldn't see in mainstream media.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.680]   And I just like that.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.680]   And I don't think we could get this show on a regular radio station.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.680]   That and the whole lack of censorship too, which is, you know, always refreshing.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.680]   I mean, yeah.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   I think it would be very interesting to hear Howard on a satellite when nobody's telling him what not to do.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.680]   Oh my.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.680]   His boulder he's saving up of things he hasn't been able to do.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   And at least the first couple of days should be pretty amazing.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   I don't know how serious he's going to do it though.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.680]   How can they pay for Howard Stern?
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   They're going to have to get...
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.680]   I think they say...
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.680]   What do they say?
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.680]   Another 10 million subscribers or something to pay for?
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   Half a billion dollars a year.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   Well, they're going to be a huge number of subscribers.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   Half a billion for five-year contracts.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.680]   Not bad.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.680]   Yeah, pretty good stuff.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.680]   He's making pretty serious bank now, Leo.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   Oh, that's true.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.680]   That's true.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.680]   But he's doing it with a much larger audience.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   That's the difference.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.680]   Well, the series is betting that they're going to be able to pick up a large portion of that audience.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.680]   And the players, by the time he gets on air, the players are going to be incredibly cheap.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.680]   The subscription's already not that bad.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.680]   It's going to be one of the most popular Christmas presents this year.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.680]   Yoshi, you listen to the podcast?
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   Do you still sell this year?
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   Honestly, I don't really listen to them that much.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.680]   How about an MP3 player?
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   What's the kind of get into it another...
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:04.680]   Well, my thing, I agree with Robert on the FM Tuner because for MP3 players, it's going to be a big number.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.680]   FM Tuner, because for MP3 players, for me, the only time I listen to the MP3 players is if I'm on foot.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   In the car, I have MP3 in my car stereo at home.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.680]   I have MP3 in my home stereo and two of my computers all networked together.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.680]   So the iPod is just about me being on foot.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   So if I'm on foot, like if I want to go down to the beach or I'm out jogging or walking around or whatever,
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.680]   maybe I might want to listen to the radio to see what's up.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   I live on the iPod.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   I mean, with all the airplane travel I do and everything.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.680]   I have books on there, I have music on there, I have podcasts on there.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.680]   It's my audio entertainment center, maybe because I've been radio so long.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   I like audio.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   It does a job for me.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   I'll play in Vegas over a couple of weeks back.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.680]   Everyone I knew who had an iPod had an FM Tuner and the new thing is,
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   either if the radio in the hotel room has an input, cool, use that, but if not, just throw the FM Tuner right there.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.680]   Right.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.680]   Tune in the cheesy clock radio and you can listen to whatever music you want.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.680]   It's a little thing like that.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   You suddenly see it creeping in everywhere.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   It's everywhere.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.680]   It's everywhere.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.680]   Guys, I want to thank you for your time.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.680]   Once again, a lot of fun.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.680]   Officially named this week in TechTwits.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   We've had a great time.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   Yoshi, thanks for being here.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.680]   Please come back next week.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.680]   Oh, definitely.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.680]   Now that I've got the settings off, I'll definitely be back.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   Oh, we're not going to use TeamSpeak next week, didn't I tell you?
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   We're going to try it on.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.680]   I want to try it mess with a during the week.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.680]   I want to try Ventrilo.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.680]   You're going to do Ventrilo, Robert, with this?
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   All right, we'll try that next week.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   I have Ventrilo and TeamSpeak on the same server, so get the one we want to try.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.680]   Let's try Ventrilo.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   Although, I have to say, there's a lot to like about TeamSpeak that lag is just killing us on this.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   I'm going to have to spend an hour editing out the gaps.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.680]   Thank God for the OBE audition.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.680]   Gotcha.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.680]   Robert Herron, it's a pleasure.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.680]   Have a great week.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   We'll talk to you next week.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   Kevin Rose, when system coming out, when, when?
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   That's a good question.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   We just got the audio pretty much almost nailed down now, so hopefully within the next week
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.680]   to two weeks.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:11.680]   We'll put a little countdown ticker on the Google website in the next few days.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   Please log into Twit.tv.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   We're at a launch party.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.680]   Oh, are you great?
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.680]   Please, when's the launch party?
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.680]   I'm going to put up a little like Java, a little ticker at the website, and then it'll be a countdown.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   We're going to have like a live cam.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   We're going to invite a bunch of people over to my house and you'll be able to kind of watch it.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   Where's the get off?
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   Launch party's a long time ago.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.680]   Launch party's a long time ago.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.680]   You want to be having more work on the parties?
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   I don't know.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.680]   I can't tell you.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.680]   I don't know the exact launch dates.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   Oh, man.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.680]   Launch the next week to two weeks.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.680]   Launch party at Kevin's, dudes.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.680]   Well, please go to Twit.tv and log in there, Kevin.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   You've got, you know, everybody gets a blog there.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   All the tweets have a blog, so you can put up some information there too and point back
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   to, I know, KevinRose.com is your main site.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   Right.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   Point back to that and let us know.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   I'm going to put a counter on Twit.tv too.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.680]   That'd be fine.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.680]   That'd be okay.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.680]   Sounds good.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.680]   Yeah, I'm going to start using that.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.680]   We all have to start using that.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   Yeah, I mean, it's just for the Twit cast, but it's a central location where people can
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   find out more.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   If you want to eat, you like that Twit cast?
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   You can stay Twit cast.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.680]   Forget podcasts.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   The future of radio is Twit cast.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   Twit cast.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   It is a Twit cast.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   What do you think?
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   I'm so glad that you were here, Patrick and Kevin Rose too.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   We do thank our, and congratulate our 1,000th subscriber this week.

[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.680]   Darren Dewey did the music for this week's Twit cast.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.680]   Nice job, Darren.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.680]   We appreciate it.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   Thanks to everybody who has subscribed.

[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   At logo ideas, we're still looking for them.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   We'll have logo winners sometime soon.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   We'll come up with some good prizes for you.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.680]   That's logos@thisweekintech.com.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:26.680]   I know I was going to announce the winner of our name contest this week, but I was bad.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   I didn't get through.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   There's so many entries.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.680]   I haven't gotten through them all yet, so we'll just have to defer it.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   Patrick, you did that.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   Box of crap is growing though, right?
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   Yes, it's going to be magnificent.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.680]   Now we're going to just want to hear it.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.680]   By the time we award that Box of crap, it's going to be.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   We have to believe that out, Leo.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.680]   It's going to be too big to mail.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.680]   It's going to have to be, that's going to be drop ship.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.680]   It's going to have to be drop ship if somebody with a ramp, a truck is going to show up at your door.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   You're going to be so sorry.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.680]   You played this game with us.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.680]   Thank you so much.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.680]   Remember Patrick's cubicle?
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   We should just deliver a replica of Patrick's cubicle to your door.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   Oh my God.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.680]   It was so cool.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.680]   You couldn't get in there.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   At one point, a crime scene tape across.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.680]   We put it in at P stains in my cubicle.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.680]   Who had P stains in his cubicle?
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.680]   Who?
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.680]   Not P.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.680]   P.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.680]   T.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.680]   That's in bed.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.680]   I don't record.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.680]   That's a cubicle.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   Oh, and that note.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   I'll tell you.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.680]   That's great.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.680]   All right.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.680]   Hey, thanks everybody.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.680]   I think I've recorded everything.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.680]   If not, I'll call you back.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.680]   We'll do it all over again now.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.680]   I'm just kidding.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:33.680]   No, I got it.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.680]   I recorded it in two different ways.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:36.680]   So I think we have a...
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   We have a Twitcast.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:50.680]   [Music]
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   Where's the Bachelor for?
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.680]   This is the end.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.680]   Where's the Bachelor for?
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.680]   [Laughter]
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:59.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:10.680]   [Laughter]
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.680]   You're the fit friend of mine who's getting married this year.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.680]   What's going on this year, folks?
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.680]   It's fine.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.680]   I don't know.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.680]   [Laughter]
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.680]   That's great.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.680]   It's your age, Robert.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   I don't know what happened.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.680]   Yeah, it's your age.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.680]   And at my age, people start dying, Robert.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   So, you know, it's good.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   You enjoy this because it's good.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.680]   [Laughter]
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.680]   I've been doing the Bachelor party.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.680]   I think that's a phaging people.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   It's a super glitter.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   [Laughter]
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   Honey, what is this on you?
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.680]   Is this glitter?
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   I see it.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.680]   Alright guys, see you later.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   Everyone, welcome.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.680]   Look at the way I got it.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.680]   [Laughter]
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.680]   [Music]
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.420]   (dramatic music)
