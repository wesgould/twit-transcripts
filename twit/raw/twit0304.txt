[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Hi.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.800]   Hey, you getting all jacked up on those caffeinated pants?
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   I am.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.100]   You know, people probably think that's crazy.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.800]   They can't have caffeinated pants.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Oh, they're they're real.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.000]   They've sold three and a half million pairs of them in France.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.400]   Oh, that explains it.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   So you're saying I see London.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   I see France.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   I see Leo's caffeinated pants.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   That's right.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   I mean, you're there.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   Your people.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.600]   Not just it's not just caffeinated.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.200]   They're impregnated as well.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Oh, the shoe.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.800]   Well, the shea butter is I don't know impregnated.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.600]   And pants is any kind of thing.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.200]   I could start a bad internet.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.600]   But they are they're like spanks for men.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   How do you like that?
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   The bank for your listening.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Mm hmm.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   And I don't watch it.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   Yeah, losing listenership as we speak.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   So John just came back from a Ford event at AT&T's AT&T Park, the Giants Stadium on talking cars.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   Well, these are it.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   It was interesting in regards to the fact that Ford has got their, I don't know.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.320]   I think they've gotten a little crazy with this futuristic stuff.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.200]   But this is a, you know, probably a lot of the fallout from it will be handy.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.920]   But these are talking cars.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.200]   But you know, every time I mentioned to somebody, it's like, there's not that there's these
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.600]   are cars that talk to you.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.480]   These are cars that talk to each other.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.320]   They talk to the highway.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   That's good.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.800]   They talk to the police department.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   They do all these things.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.120]   I don't want to, I don't want to card a chatty car.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120]   That's like night rider.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.120]   That's always talking to me.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.560]   Remember a few years ago they had that there was a there was a, I think, Toyota.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   It was a car.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   And I hated it.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.920]   This is not that your door is open.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.920]   This is the car.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   This is a car that communicates.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.440]   So it's a communicating car and it talks all kinds.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.040]   So like for example, in a perfect world where everything was tuned to these cars, the car
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.520]   would be driving along and there'd be another talking car in front of it.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.040]   And the car in front of it would talk, you wouldn't know this.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.360]   You'd fall asleep at the wheel and your car would talk to the other car and say, hang
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.760]   on because I'm going to hit you.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   That's great.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   That's great.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.160]   It would turn, it would slam on the brakes and stop you from hitting the guy.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.080]   See, I see what's going on here, which is Ford wants to make autonomous vehicles or move
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   a step towards it, but they don't want to say autonomous vehicles.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080]   No, they don't.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.080]   They actually made a point.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.080]   They made a point.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080]   They made a point.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   They made a point.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080]   But they've smart so lame now nobody would call it that.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   Right.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.600]   No, no, they made a point that they don't want autonomous cars.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.680]   They say that the driving experience is important and people don't really want autonomous
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680]   cars.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.080]   They want everything handled, but they still want a driver behind the wheel.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.080]   Well, I think, yeah, people aren't yet comfortable with the notion that a car would be driving
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.080]   itself.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   Well, I'll tell you, I wrote in that Google car that drove it south.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   Did you write that?
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   The self-driving car?
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.880]   Not only did I write in it, I also stepped in front of it in a crosswalk with only 20
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   feet to go.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.960]   No, you got to talk to George Stephanopoulos because this guy, he just keeps putting you
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   in danger.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.040]   Between the snakes and the pants and this robotic car.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.440]   They will do anything for ratings.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   But I'm telling you that.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.440]   Listen, you're the red shirt person on GMA.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.960]   She's an expendable one on a star trek, right?
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   Red shirt guy.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   Always dies.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.560]   It's like, well, let Becky try it.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   Pretty much.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   Anyway, so the debate began.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   It was amazing, though.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   It really worked.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.560]   It was incredible.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.800]   It stopped before it hit you as testament to that you're here.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.560]   But I wouldn't, just to finish the thoughts, sorry, John, I wouldn't be comfortable having
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.960]   a self-driving car, but where I really saw its functionality is in situations as John's
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   describing where people fall asleep or you look away to text and it's got your back.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.360]   If it's only for five seconds, I'm not saying that condones texting, but people do it.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.600]   Or look at the GPS or something.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   So sorry, John, go ahead.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.960]   The problem is, it's not like my wife doesn't say, hey, there's a hottie at 12 o'clock.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.600]   Engage auto drive so I can rubber neck.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   A fwhistle auto drive.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.600]   The problem is they say that their infrastructures know where to be found because they need smart
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.360]   highways and this never going to happen.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   Right.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.360]   Right.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   Because they're not just talking to other cars.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.800]   They need to talk to the highway because they need to know where the road is.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   But that's not what Google says.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   Google doesn't need it.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.360]   They only think it's going to come out of this.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.320]   The only thing that's going to come out of this.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.440]   The only thing that's going to come out of this is they're going to have black boxes and
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   all the cars.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.280]   And once a year, when you get your car smogged in California, you're going to bring your
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.280]   black box in.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.440]   They're going to look at it and you're going to get 15 retroactive tickets from local police
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.440]   departments.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   That is exactly what's going to happen.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.560]   I think you're right because we've already got red light cameras.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.040]   This is just the logical next step.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.000]   Oh, you ran a red light on July 15th.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Oh, you ran.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.360]   You were going over the speed limit on July 23rd.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.200]   I can see that.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   I can see that.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.760]   Yeah, he's been talking to us.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   It's not a conspiracy.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   They're already talking about this being implemented by police departments around the
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.760]   country.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   You know what I say?
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.760]   Sure.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.760]   And say agencies.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   That would worry me more.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   Absolutely.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.760]   El subpoena that information in a heart.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.840]   If the information exists, it will be subpoenaed.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.040]   We'll see whether you get retroactive tickets.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   With everybody right.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.320]   All these municipalities running out of money, they're looking for any sort of revenue stream.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   And this is a beauty.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.360]   Gouch him in the chatroom has a great name for it.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.320]   The new Ford Taddler.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.840]   That will you driving record.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   You know, that's interesting.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.720]   So who's you say they're already talking?
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   Who's they?
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.120]   Who's already talking about it?
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.320]   If you start reading police blogs and municipal blogs, there's a discussion about black boxes.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   It's all over the place.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.320]   Has it been on lawn order?
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.240]   If it hasn't been on lawn order, it's not a black box in them since 2006.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.760]   All of these cars have the little plug-in things that can tell you a lot about what's
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.760]   been going on.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.360]   And if they recorded, would record speeds and so forth, but they'd also have a GPS built-in
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.760]   so they'd know they could match the coordinates.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.560]   And so I don't know.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.440]   Have you also seen these cameras for teenagers?
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.960]   So the ones where they cash a certain amount of data and the same thing.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.200]   Cabbies have had these for years.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.520]   Yeah, if there's any incidents, then that's automatically stored into memory.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.520]   But I mean.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.520]   You know what will happen?
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.880]   You'll get a discount on your insurance if you agree to have it.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   Maybe something like that.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.880]   But I'd hate to see a municipality doing that.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   You know what?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.040]   I don't think they will, John, because of it crosses state lines and city lines and
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.160]   they'd have to say, oh, we're only going to look at our city and I don't know if that
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.360]   can happen.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.520]   The chat room is chastising me because I don't see that as a problem.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.520]   I don't see that as a problem.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.880]   It's one of the first things I'd implement if I was a mayor.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.600]   That's why we have not a law.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   What's the argument?
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   What's the beef?
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   We're not going to elect you, John.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.280]   It's going to save a lot of police money because you don't have all these guys patrolling
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.800]   with radar guns anymore.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.760]   You don't have to.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.520]   And you just bring these people in once a year and you get your tickets.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.480]   I don't see that you did save money on those cameras and save money.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.840]   It saves so much money and makes money.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.960]   It's just a bonanza.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   It's so obvious.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.040]   It's a long order bonanza.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   The Ford Snitch.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.040]   It's a bonanza.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.240]   DA happened this week, actually, D9.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.240]   D9.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.400]   One more, one better.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.760]   That's the All Things Digital Conference.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.720]   We actually, we asked Cara to come in.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   Cara Swisher to come in.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   I think she was very busy.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.240]   We'll get her on in a future show.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.640]   But they did a great job, a great panel, including Google's Eric Schmidt.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   The Schmidt.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.600]   The Schmidt who was very presidential.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.640]   He was so mellow compared to his other wonky appearances where he said at least one complete
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.680]   wanger of a statement, but he was controlled.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.760]   The scuttle butt as he wants to run for a press.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   Oh, why?
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.840]   You know, he didn't get the commerce job.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.520]   That would have been a stepping stone, you know, at least some service.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.600]   Here's Cara Swisher just asked him, what did he do wrong as CEO of Google?
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.760]   Well, if you, when we talk about the identity discussion we have about Facebook, when I
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.480]   went back and looked four years ago, I wrote memos, which talked in general terms about
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.040]   this, I did nothing about the memos I wrote.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.440]   Three years ago, I wrote memos that talked about this general problem.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   What's the, what's the problem?
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.360]   The Facebook identity problem online that people don't have a way to create a personal
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.560]   identity and that Facebook has done that.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   By basically giving people a,
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.560]   Stealing a march on Google.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560]   Right.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.740]   So I would say that's probably the thing that I, I, I, I clearly knew that I had to do something
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.200]   and I failed to do it.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.280]   And why was that?
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.280]   I think I was busy.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   I didn't even.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.600]   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.260]   At least he didn't say I was drunk because that's what I always said.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.260]   That's, that's one thing.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.240]   He basically owned up to the fact that he calls it the identity problem.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.080]   Um, and he says, and I'm quoting here Facebook, it's the first generally available way of
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.880]   disambiguating identity on the internet.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   Okay.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880]   So, and Twitter has that too.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880]   So you're @beckyworley.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   You're the only one and only @beckyworley.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880]   Beworley.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   Um, or beworley.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   Yes.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880]   Okay.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880]   Well, that's important.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.880]   B.W.O.R.L.E.Y.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.320]   Um, you're John, you're the real Devorak.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   Yup.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.520]   Um, um, atleo report.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   So, so Twitter has that Facebook kind of, but they're not really has it because I have
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.080]   a fake John Devorak on, on Facebook.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.080]   What is that?
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.240]   Facebook.com/fakejohndevorak.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.640]   No, it's just John.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.640]   It says me.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   It said claims to be me.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.640]   It says elio la port.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.800]   That's part of the problem is that there are many people with the same name.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.400]   I mean, Devorak maybe is not so common.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   Well, actually.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.920]   Yeah, but I know this claims to be me.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   Right.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.400]   Well, hey, look, this is even worse.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.280]   Here's John La Porte.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.120]   So that's kind of, and he looks just.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.520]   I just kind of a mashup.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.200]   Looks like our love child.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.560]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.640]   Search for the wrong, search for the wrong name.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.560]   So I should search for John Devorak.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.560]   But I mean.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.280]   No, and this is, which one is you?
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.280]   Is that you, John?
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   I never use Facebook.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   I fight.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   There it is.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.280]   That's not you.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   John Devor.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   No, no, I don't have a Facebook account.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280]   How could it be me?
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.760]   I'm going to like it anyway.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.960]   But see, the point is is that you let a bunch of people have to play.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.680]   I put you on there.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.680]   You don't have an account.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.160]   No, that's not me.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.160]   Sure.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   He's just making this up to get people to like it.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.480]   But that's why I don't think Facebook has won this one.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.960]   For instance, if I type Facebook.com/leoloporte, it's not me.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   But this is one of those places where we may or may not be the German.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   Nevermind.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.360]   Our situation may not be German to the average Joe because for the average Joe creating an
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.280]   identity online is not an identity for a public face.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.200]   It's an identity in their community.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.840]   Yeah, but I think eventually don't you want to have a unique identifier on the net?
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.680]   It may not be John Smith.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.600]   If your name is John Smith, it might be something else.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.400]   But don't you, I mean, chat handles, for instance, are kind of considered unique.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.240]   It is kind of bad form to copy somebody's channel.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.120]   Don't you think ultimately, just as we have a unique phone number, we'll want some sort
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.840]   of unique identity on the net?
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.760]   I think that was the fear is that Facebook was going to steal this or Twitter was going
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.920]   to steal this in Google.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.040]   That's why they created Google profiles.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.680]   But they don't have a competitor.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.760]   They don't have a competitive product.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.040]   That hasn't gone anywhere.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   No.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   No.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040]   I thought it might.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.000]   I don't think there's anything unifying or ubiquitous that's made any kind of a play
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.560]   for this except Facebook.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.000]   And Google did have an opportunity and they blew it.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.800]   And that was what Schmidt was owning up to is that they had the opportunity.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.120]   I think he's overstating the case.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.000]   I don't think I agree with you, Leo.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I don't think they actually had that.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   They didn't blow anything.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   They couldn't do it.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.360]   And that was Mossberg's follow up.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.320]   He said, well, you tried.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.320]   It wasn't that you were busy.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   It was that you failed.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   That wasn't that I was busy.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   I sucked.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.320]   And it's good for Walt for following up that way.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   I think he's right.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   I don't think they missed it.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.480]   And you know what, three years ago, did you think of Google as a source of identity or
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   a search engine?
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.160]   They're a search engine.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.080]   They're still are a search engine.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.960]   He also talked a lot about this gang of four.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.080]   Well, that was interesting because he left out Microsoft.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.040]   And I think there were a lot of people in Redmond who were upset.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:12.440]   He said the people that power technology today are Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.320]   And would you disagree?
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   No.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.520]   I think his point was they are the four broadest consumer brands that have gone to a global
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520]   level.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.520]   Right.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.880]   And while Microsoft may be a very powerful tech brand, they have lost their cache as
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.880]   a consumer brand.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.920]   Well, he did admit they are a good enterprise brand.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.440]   He just said they're not a consumer.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.440]   You agree, John?
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.000]   Yeah, I agree 100%.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.600]   I think in fact, if you if it scares me a little bit, if you look at how successful,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   particularly Facebook and Amazon are, it's a little scary.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.480]   I don't want them to be this successful.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.200]   Two more things he said, use a Mac for security.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.800]   If you care about security, it was wrong on that one.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   But those days are over.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   You buy in that.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.080]   I mean, don't you guys remember Mac.Simpsons.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.520]   Don't remember that virus?
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.480]   Way back then.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.320]   The first viruses I've experienced were Mac viruses, but that was OS 9.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   That was a long time ago.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   But I mean, that's the point is like, so we've seen some malware.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.600]   But does that mean that the party's over?
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   I think the party's over.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.560]   And you know why I think it's a numbers, in my opinion, it's a numbers game.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.840]   There was a good article on the ultimate, I'm sorry, the unofficial Apple web blog.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.560]   I can't remember the guy's name.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.600]   But he says purely a numbers game because Apple has now gotten to the point where about
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.040]   17% market share of all computers.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.640]   Because so many Windows users have become so security conscious, it's about 80% of Windows
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.120]   users are protected by anti viruses.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.440]   So the 20% of Windows users that are unprotected, 70% Mac users unaffected, it's about the
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   same number.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   In other words, the Macintosh platform represents a good opportunity now.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.080]   Yeah, it's easy pickens.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.520]   And it is because these people are, and I include myself, completely unsecurity conscious.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.960]   Yeah, living in a fantasy land also.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.280]   I think that it's a self-selecting, more affluent community because the computers are
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   more expensive.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   Think about that.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.080]   If you can hit the Mac people, don't you want to?
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.800]   Although I keep saying, and I keep waiting for the real gold, the pot of gold is in the
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.720]   cell phone and iPhone, the minute you can figure out a way to get on somebody's iPhone, you've
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.720]   made it.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   Gold and...
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   Everything's on it.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.880]   You know, was it you, John, who was telling me that there's a market in New York City for
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.240]   taxi cabs for lost phones?
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.720]   The taxi drivers know exactly where to go to sell a, you know, you drive up in the guy
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.800]   in the corner and give you a hundred bucks and they give you more money if you've popped
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.720]   the battery.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.080]   And so what they're not looking for the phone, they're looking for the data on the phone.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.280]   So if you've popped the battery, the person who lost the phone can't erase it or deactivate
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   it.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.160]   So now the bad guy has the phone and it's loaded with personal information, contactless,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.320]   all sorts of stuff, credit card numbers.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   So there is already a market for the hardware.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.240]   I could just have mattered time before people start hacking the cell phones.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.400]   One last thing on Schmidt, and then I'll shut up about Schmidt.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.960]   No, I like Schmidt.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.560]   When pressed on which was the third mobile OS, you know, obviously Android.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.120]   Why phone, Android?
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.320]   He would not answer.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.920]   He doesn't want to say Windows and he doesn't want to say Blackberry.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.920]   He doesn't know.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.360]   He doesn't want to say Pre or whatever it is.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   Yeah, WebOS.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   WebOS.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   I mean, that was interesting to me.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360]   WebOS.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   He was so cagey.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.440]   You don't think HP can pull it off?
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   No.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   And they said, who was it from HP?
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.440]   You said that they licensed WebOS.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.040]   Did the proficers say they'd licensed WebOS?
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   Yeah, to HTC.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.320]   It was a hypothetical question from Josh Topolsky, but I thought that was interesting.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   That is interesting.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.280]   He didn't want -- it was sort of an S.E. grin when he said it, but you know, he said it.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.120]   I think if Microsoft does end up buying Nokia, and apparently that's been something that's
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.560]   been around for a while.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.600]   It's always been an option for Microsoft.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.360]   They end up buying Nokia.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.240]   And with the way Nokia's stock price is tumbling and they're troubled to Nokia's been having,
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.040]   I think this could very well happen.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.720]   Then that's a pretty credible third platform.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.600]   You kind of -- you forget WebOS.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.400]   You probably can forget Blackberry, too.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.280]   I mean, if there's still Blackberry here in South Carolina.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.960]   No, they can't do both.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.120]   It's going to cost them $20 billion for any -- for either -- they're both about the same
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.120]   price right now.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.040]   $20 billion for either RIM or Nokia.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.280]   They cannot afford a $40 billion deal.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.280]   Who would you buy?
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   Which would you buy?
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.280]   If you can't buy both.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.280]   You'd buy Nokia.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   Because not so much for the U.S., but you buy them for international.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.680]   And you use them because you need a hardware play, obviously.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.320]   But now, if you want to buy them for like kind of changing direction and, again, because
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.600]   there's still people addicted to the RIM Blackberry.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.080]   I mean, I still see people see it.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   Oh, tons of black.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   I have to use this.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.200]   You know where they use it a lot now in high schools?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.680]   You wouldn't think kids would use it.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.680]   But kids love Blackberry Messenger.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.200]   I see lots of kids type it away on their Blackberries.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.760]   It's less expensive.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.040]   It's the next step from the sidekick.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.720]   Basically when sidekick has started to go away, Blackberry is the next thing.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.080]   And I also think this is a West Coast buy.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   It's not a start.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   And who ruined sidekick, by the way?
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   Who killed that?
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   Microsoft.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   Microsoft.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.160]   By the way, if your data was on sidekick servers, they turned it off this week.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.200]   So say goodbye.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   I know.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.640]   And then, of course, there's a Microsoft kin.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.080]   Well, there's always that.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.040]   We're going to talk more about D9 because the other boy they dominated the news this
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.600]   week, the other big announcement, Stephen Sanovsky, from Microsoft showing off Windows
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   8.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   We're going to save Microsoft.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.120]   Let's talk about it in just a moment.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.600]   Becky Worley is here from Good Morning America.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   I tried to hire her for Twit, but no.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   I love you, man.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   No, she loves us, but she doesn't...
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   I love you.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   She loves the money more.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.080]   She loves the money.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.080]   That's all right.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   That's all right.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.080]   We're going to new studios going.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.040]   You might want to visit more.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.040]   I love my people.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.680]   I love Becky.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   And Steak's done.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   I don't know.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   What is that timer?
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.680]   Is that just to say hi?
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.680]   Little tapbell.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:06.200]   I've decided that everyone should have one of these tapbells for their desk at work.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   Nice.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.160]   And to somebody, you're busy, you're hunched over the computer.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.560]   You got this thing on your desk and somebody wants to talk to you?
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.720]   That's a good idea.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.000]   My kids would like me to have one at the dinner table because I'm always in my nose buried
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.240]   in a device.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.080]   They could bing my bell.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.240]   Baking dang dad's bell.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.040]   You can ding dad's bell.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.520]   Ding dad's bell.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.960]   The apologies to Anita.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   What is her name?
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   Anita Baker.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   Anita.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   Anita Hot Pocket.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.600]   Let's, uh, Josie Dvorak's also here for channel to work.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.400]   But right now I'd like to talk a little bit about, no, not the brick twit house.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.560]   Oh, well, we could mention that we have bricks for sale.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.520]   Fine bricks, only $128.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.520]   You don't get them.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.520]   We get them.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.760]   It's kind of a strange thing.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.320]   You help us build a new studio.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   Brickstutt twit.t.t.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.800]   I did not mention that last week.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.320]   Be a part of twit.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.600]   This is be a part of the twit brick house or the brick twit house, depending on how
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.120]   far you want to be.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.120]   These are the bricks.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.120]   $128.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.160]   Now they're going to go on a wall right in the entryway there.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.000]   So you can come visit your brick.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.400]   You have 15 characters, two lines, 15 characters each.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.320]   That's the $128 brick.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.200]   If you want the, that's the eight by four.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.760]   If you want the eight by eight square brick, that's $512.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.800]   There's even one you can get your logo, your company logo on that.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   These are very limited.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.320]   I think there's only a couple hundred of those available.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.560]   Love the patina on the brick.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   Isn't that nice?
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.560]   Yeah, yeah, these are pretty.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.520]   And we have international sales, but you have to call the number.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   Unfortunately, bricks.twit.tv it's all there.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.880]   And finally, if you want, and John, we're going to send you one of these because I know,
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.040]   I know how much you love bricks.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   I love bricks.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.160]   You want to commemorate a brick that matches the brick that's in the brick twit house.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.320]   You could have that on your, it makes a fine paperweight.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.520]   It weighs about 12 pounds.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.280]   It makes a good weapon.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.400]   If you don't like somebody throw it to the window, but don't throw the one that has your
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.200]   name and address on it.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.080]   Anyway, bricks.twit.tv.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.440]   It's helping us build the twit brick house.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.040]   Turned out to be a little bit more expensive for the studio than we had anticipated.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.160]   So this is our way of letting you participate.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.400]   No, it is not tax deductible.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.000]   We're not a charity or nonprofit.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.120]   We're just not making any money.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.040]   Brick.twit.tv.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.160]   But now that's enough of that.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.160]   Let's talk about go to my PC.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.840]   One of our fine sponsors Citrix has been with us since almost the beginning.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.160]   They've really been a great sponsor.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.160]   And they make great products.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.680]   They're very happy to do these ads for Citrix.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.640]   Go to my PC is the kind of the king of the remote access programs for Citrix.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.280]   Citrix is very well known for Citrix Enterprise.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.040]   That's probably the best known, the best Windows remote access server.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.400]   A lot of companies use it.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.560]   Go to my PC is kind of the consumer version of it.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.680]   And here's a nice thing.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   You don't really need to get the IT department involved.

[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.360]   They've got a great free iPad app.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.840]   That is very sweet to be able to access office emails, send and receive email, run any program,
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.040]   access network resources all on the road from the iPad.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.360]   Very, very cool.

[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.040]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:47.680]   The try it free button right here and into the offer code TWIT.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.680]   That's all we ask.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.120]   And we thank Citrix so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.160]   So are you a way, I have to ask you both.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.000]   Are you, I know I think John is a Windows user.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Are you a Windows user?
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.560]   No, I'm predominantly a Mac user, but we have Windows machines at home.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   I try and stay fluent on both.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   Me too.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.160]   I think it's important in our jobs.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.520]   John, you, you mostly Windows, right?
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.200]   So, yeah, mostly Windows.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.920]   Did you look with interest if you go to Microsoft.com/presspass?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.160]   There's a lot of video of Steven Sonofsky at the D8 conference and then of somebody
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.920]   at the Computex conference in Taiwan demonstrating the new user interface.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.120]   It's, well, it looks like Windows Phone.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.120]   It's so weird.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.120]   I don't like it.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.200]   I think I wrote a column about it.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.840]   I think it's in PC Magazine.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.760]   I think it's a disaster if they implement it.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.280]   Well, I'm sure they are.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   Clearly.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280]   Are we on cycle for disaster?
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   What does it go?
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.280]   98 disaster.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   Emmy.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   Emmy.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   Emmy was disaster.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   I think good.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   Windows Vista disaster.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   So, we're right on track.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.280]   It's like a Star Trek movies.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.280]   So, I'm saying.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:58.920]   Why don't you like it, John?
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:04.120]   Well, I think for one thing, I don't think that the model, I think it's a done deal what
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.800]   a desktop computer should be like, how it should be used.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.040]   Those, that interface that we're talking about that they're trying to replace it with is
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.360]   for small screens, it's, the reason it's designed, there's a reason it was designed
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.040]   the way it was designed, the reason that Steve Jobs brought it into play, because it
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.760]   was the thing you could use with your finger and a touchscreen and a small touchscreen and
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.920]   you needed to, you know, you need these icons to move around.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.440]   There's a rationale for it.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:36.040]   There's no rationale for this stupid interface to be on a large 21 inch, 27 inch screen.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   It's crazy.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.760]   So, we're talking about, just for people who haven't seen it or are listening, we're talking
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.280]   about the Metro UI that's on the Windows Phone 7.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.520]   It has the large tiles that each represent sort of a concept or, you know, like social
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.680]   or contacts or phone or, but this would have specifics, it's almost like, they're trying
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.960]   to create almost like an expose interface, but for Windows and using it, marrying it
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.320]   with the Metro UI that we've gotten to know on the phone.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.520]   It's a touch interface.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   Exactly.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.600]   Now, here's what my theory is.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.520]   My theory is that Microsoft has had nothing but difficulty adapting its operating system
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.760]   to the phone.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.160]   And what they've always tried to do since the very beginning with Windows, before Windows
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.960]   Phone when they had their first smartphones is they took the big Windows interface from
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.480]   a desktop and put it on the phone.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.760]   So now, instead of separating these two as separate items and separate things, they keep
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.040]   wanting to have them all the same because I think they figure that all their users are
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.520]   complete idiots and they can't go from one model to another.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.080]   So they're going to take the phone model that they know works on small screens and move
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.560]   it to the desktop.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.160]   Now, I think they can save themselves by having a little butt you can push that would throw
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.160]   you back to real.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.160]   They do.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   They do.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.080]   That's what's so strange about this is it really is just a shell on top of what looks
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.080]   like when they're sitting.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   Look at it.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.080]   You have a picture of it up on this video.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   It looks dumb.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.440]   This is the default that will show up on all computers that ship with this and you have
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.880]   to revert back to the Windows.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.000]   It looks like a kiosk.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.400]   The kind of thing you find at a kiosk at Macy's.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.040]   Well, all right.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.000]   See, and there's the start menu.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.920]   So he slides it over on the right and you can just jump underneath it.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.160]   So when you have Microsoft Excel or Office or whatever and you need to have that kind
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:24.240]   of, let's face it, get real Windows control, you can get there.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.800]   But let me play devil's advocate here.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.240]   One of the things that the iPad really proved to everybody is that there is a market for
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.160]   a simpler computing experience.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.520]   The iPad requires a touchscreen interface that requires your finger or thumb or something
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.320]   like that to move things around.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.680]   This is not what desktop computing is about.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.080]   This even has a pop up keyboard, which is idiotic.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.840]   I have a real keyboard.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   That's a good point.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.400]   Why do I need this pull crap?
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.720]   Well, I guess this is one UI for all devices.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.240]   So if you've got a tablet problem, they have their heads up their butch with this one UI
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.480]   for everything they do notion.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   They're crazy.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   I kind of feel bad for Microsoft.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.080]   I got to work.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.080]   I miss you, man.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.760]   That kind of, I mean, there's so many bad things going on in the world, but this pisses
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.760]   you off so much.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.760]   It's so comforting to me.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:21.000]   I'm mad about other stuff too.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.680]   This is, okay, I'm still trying to play devil's advocate here.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.440]   I think it's a great tablet UI.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.000]   It's a tablet UI.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.440]   Really good tablet UI.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.280]   But why try and put this on?
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.560]   I love the HP TouchSmart cell because that's a touch desktop with, you know, using Windows
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.520]   Vista or Windows 7.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   Look at this.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.520]   They're very proud of this.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   It's got a split keyboard.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   You can type with your thumbs.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.520]   I don't think that they've been setting the world on fire and I still don't know.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.840]   So now see, you've got Excel.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   Now there's it.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.240]   So you have a normal experience, a Windows experience underneath, but you can slide
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:56.840]   it to get tweet a Rama.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.840]   You know, there's there's this.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:04.160]   This is great for that ubiquitous kitchen computer that every PC make a model.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.160]   And that's the touch.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   Right.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:13.320]   So that you can touch, you can treat it like a tablet, but then you can move into a multitasking.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.920]   You have more detailed input output with a keyboard and a mouse, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.480]   But what if we're just old farts who just want things to stay the same?
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.240]   No, that's not it, Leo.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.800]   The desktop metaphor, which was developed in 1980 something, 1984, I guess, mainly
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.480]   or 82, or actually when the Xerox Star came out, established.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.960]   And then it was tweaked and tweaked and tweaked.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.280]   This is like the automobile.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.560]   You can drive a 1935 car because it's been the model, how it works, where the gears
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.360]   have started with the pedals.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.040]   It's finally established itself as this is the way it should be.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.440]   Why would you change it so radically out of the blue?
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.000]   This is like people dreaming up some crazy car where the wheels in the middle and you
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.680]   know what the pair of these is that tomorrow on Monday, Apple will be talking about Lion
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   OS 10 Lion.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.680]   It's new operating system and they're not even going this far.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.160]   I mean, they have a full screen mode.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.920]   Of course, because they're not stupid at Apple.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.640]   This is Microsoft letting the pendulum swing too far in the other direction.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.800]   It sure looks like they're chasing Apple on this.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   I mean, a couple of things.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.240]   Can you imagine if you had a mouse and you were using your computer with a touchpad
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.880]   or a mouse, do you scroll the icons up to take up one tenth of the screen size?
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.120]   That's kind of what would happen, right?
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.480]   No, everybody puts them in list or detail because that's how the brain works.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.160]   I agree with John in that respect.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.680]   But it just feels like Microsoft is trying too hard.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.480]   Also, you think about the skin that they did with a media center.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   Nobody liked that.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.480]   Nobody used that.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480]   They all switched that.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.200]   Even in fact, in the Leanback experience on a TV, it didn't do very well.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:54.720]   This -- Mike, Apple's had this front row thing for a long time for media on all Macintashes.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.320]   And so going back to the HP Touchmark thing, I really agree with Steve Jobs here from just
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.240]   a HCI perspective.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.720]   I don't think Touch works in vertical.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.800]   It's a horizontal experience.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.560]   And this mandates if you're going to have --
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.560]   Well, that's what Apple said.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.720]   Steve Jobs said nobody's going to want to reach their arm out to touch the screen in front
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   of them.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.000]   And that was studied to death with the Gavilan computer back in the 1980s.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.080]   I remember the Gavilan.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   I remember the --
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.240]   And they had a touch screen that used a pen.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:28.560]   And they discovered that people were having all kinds of problems sticking their hand forward
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.880]   onto the screen.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.520]   And then it was a nuisance.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.120]   That's why the Wacom tablet, people sell so many Wacom tablets.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.680]   Well, and Apple's response to that is, well, don't worry because you can use the mouse
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.680]   and keyboard.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.200]   But then you're using the mouse and keyboard for an interface design for touch.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.640]   So it's -- wait a minute, I'm not doing the devil's advocate anymore.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.480]   Well, but I can go back to that.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   It's a three-word view.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   A couple things.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.520]   One, this would be a great tablet OS.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.520]   I think it will be a great tablet OS.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:01.560]   And I think Microsoft has this huge opportunity to finally do multitasking right.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.920]   Nobody's done it right in tablets.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   Not RIM.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   Nobody's done it right yet.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.720]   In fact, in my opinion, I don't think you should multitask.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.960]   And that may be the thing.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.440]   If you're the only thing you need to multitask is music, Pandora, that kind of stuff that's
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   in the background.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.280]   I don't think you want a program that we're running.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.000]   It kills the battery.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.240]   When you're on a full-screen experience, whatever's full-screen should be running, anything else
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   should be not running.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.400]   But I think when you're trying to use the iPad as a productivity tool, which I do all
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.080]   the time when I'm on a six-hour flight, it's the only device I take with me.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.360]   Granted, I use it as a toy when I'm at home.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.440]   But when I mobile, I use it as a tool.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   I would like to have a productivity mode where I would have better multitasking and --
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   So maybe this is it.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.440]   Maybe.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.720]   And by the way, you've got a Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.080]   Suddenly you've got a computer.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.160]   And I can see this for tablet, but I'm not sure this is going to work for a standard PCOS.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   Well, like some people in the chat room, and I've said it too, I said in the column, Microsoft
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.480]   will have a fallback.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.840]   This will be an option.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.880]   Although it's going to be the default option, which is going to turn off a lot of people.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.320]   Because as we know, there's a number of people that buy these machines that are too -- I
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.880]   don't hate to say it, but they're too stupid to know that they can change stuff.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.400]   They're too stupid to know they don't have to buy Windows.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.040]   Well, but there's a lot of people just buy Windows because that's what -- oh, isn't --
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.600]   I take that thing back because I think a lot of people buy Windows because of the price
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.040]   point, I always go back to that.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.840]   But it's also the default.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.840]   You have to talk somebody into buying something besides Windows.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   It's the default.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.760]   And just to do a little sidebar, what do you guys think about these ultra books?
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   Did you see those super in?
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.280]   Yeah, Intel's announced these new very lightweight MacBook Air clones.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.240]   It seems like the entire world is chasing Apple at this point.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.240]   Seriously.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.720]   The difference would be that they're a fast process of the i5 or i7's Ivy Bridge.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.000]   And the start and stand.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.240]   And better battery life.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.680]   So, SHIB, I had these extremely lightweight machines for a whole whole thing caused a
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.760]   fortune for years.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.000]   And nobody ever gives them credit for that.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And now for Apple.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Oh, they were great.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.560]   Apple comes out with the air and now everyone's copying the look.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.200]   It looks like they're copying the air and they're trying to make it look better.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.760]   Oh, but nothing looked like the air.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.840]   No, but the new Asus looks pretty nasty.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.840]   I like that.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.840]   Oh, I love that.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.680]   And Lenovo's got the X1.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.880]   There's some nice, very thin, very light computers.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   They're very expensive too.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.240]   The problem is they're too expensive.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:21.120]   I mean, if they're going to get, you might as well just get an air.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.000]   Well they're saying in fact that Intel's saying that they're going to get the price
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.040]   below $1,000.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.040]   This is Intel.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   To me, it's Intel.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   Just below.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.280]   This is Intel responding, I think, to the challenge that ARM presents and the mobile
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280]   platform.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.920]   They can't get into mobile computing.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:44.400]   So they're trying to create more platforms for themselves instead of desktop and laptop.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.800]   I just not excited about it.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.120]   Yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to get yours to do.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   Not excited about it.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.680]   I also just wanted to follow back on the chatroom cat weasel in the chatroom says, "I don't
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.880]   think I've ever disagreed more strongly with the panel.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.160]   Seriously, people have been screaming for innovation in UI since the earliest PCs because
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.120]   they don't make sense to regular non-tech users."
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.960]   That's kind of what I was trying to say.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:09.040]   It's difficult to figure out that a file folder has stuff in it.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.600]   And if you double click on something, it actually works.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.800]   It runs a program.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.560]   That is so hard.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.080]   But Cat who does make a...
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   What's his name?
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   Cat and Hazel.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   Cat weasel.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   Cat weasel.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   Does make sense in one respect.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.840]   That's what I was kind of saying, which is, but maybe there's a whole class of computer
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:30.000]   users for whom the desktop is too complicated but would like to have a computer.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.480]   I do commend Microsoft for at least trying, right?
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.920]   Okay, but let's go back and look at it.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   The cycle.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.360]   This is exactly what they've done.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.400]   The good ones starting 98.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   Too complicated.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   Let's make ME.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   It's for people who think it's too complicated.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400]   Microsoft Bob.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   Bob Vista.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   And I'm worried that this is that step down, this talk down that doesn't work out so great.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   But maybe this will be the one.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.280]   You know what it shows?
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.560]   And I am not an Apple fanboy.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.960]   I think people know that by now, but it just shows the difference somehow.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.560]   Whatever that is, it's DNA or something between what?
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.200]   But Apple somehow seems to get it and know where to use this stuff and where not to use
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   it.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.480]   And the other guys who copy Apple just don't seem to get it.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480]   Am I wrong there?
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.120]   They're not copying it quite right.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.120]   They're not kind.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.680]   It's kind of not doing it.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   We'll see.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.240]   You know, Windows 8 will come out next year and you can all laugh at us.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.480]   We'll save this particular segment.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.640]   But Sean, are you predicting a flopola?
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:30.160]   Well, for the interface, I think it might be, it will be a great little interface for
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.720]   tablets.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.480]   But for the desktop, nobody's going to use it.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.680]   It looks like, like I said, it looks like a Macy's kiosk.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.800]   Who wants a kiosk for idiots?
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.320]   You're right.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.800]   And I think Becky agrees.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   Wow.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.240]   We're going to take a break.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.400]   We have lots more to talk about.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.200]   Apple's got the WWDC tomorrow.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.440]   We're going to be covering that live starting at 945 Pacific 1245 Eastern at live.tv.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.480]   Alex Lindsey, Tom Merritt.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:04.000]   A couple of Apple developers, including Aaron Hilligas of Big Nerd Ranch, will be in studio.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.440]   Talking about that, the same time Microsoft's doing its Xbox conference at E3.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.440]   I'm going down to E3 because we'll have coverage on Tuesday of E3.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.120]   Too much stuff is happening all at once.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   Great week.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.000]   But let's talk about in just a second, iOS 5, OS 10 Lion.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.480]   And finally, Apple, unheard of, has a press release saying, "Yes, Steve Jobs will be giving
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.120]   the keynote and he will be talking about iCloud.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   What is it?"
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.360]   I didn't know they knew how to write press releases.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.360]   They have a press release.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.360]   What?
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.520]   But before we do that though, let me quickly mention squarespace.com, the secret behind
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.160]   exceptional websites.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.000]   We've been talking about Squarespace for some time.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.080]   Our Twit blog is on it inside.twit.tv.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:50.160]   We're doing a complete web redesign based on our Drupal platform and the website, guys,
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.280]   ImageX Media up in Vancouver asked me, "Well, what about your blog?"
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.800]   And I said, "Are you kidding?
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.840]   We are never taking it off Squarespace.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.400]   This is the platform."
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.760]   If you're looking to set up a website, not just a blog, any website, a photography website,
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.000]   a site for your business, you've got to have a website.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.120]   You cannot live with a Facebook page alone.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.120]   Check it out.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   Free for two weeks.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.520]   You just go to squarespace.com/twit and fill out the simple form that just says, "Give
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.880]   me a name, a password, an email and you're done.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880]   You're ready."
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.120]   You've got the full access to the Squarespace design tools, including their amazing social
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.480]   widgets.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.160]   So yes, you can incorporate your Facebook page or your Flickr page or your Twitter page easily
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.000]   right into that Squarespace site.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   And here's the deal.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.600]   You don't have to know JavaScript or CSS.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.360]   You just put the little widget in there.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.400]   You do the sliders, the checkboxes and you're getting a unique design that's going to look
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.760]   great with your site, even arbitrary RSS feeds so that you can put anything you want in there.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.680]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.080]   Take a look at the example sites.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.160]   You get some idea of what people are doing with the amazing Squarespace platform, including
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:05.600]   the pro photographers, the artists, the nonprofits, businesses of all kind who use Squarespace
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.000]   to create their websites.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.960]   Squarespace is hosting plus software.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.200]   You never have to update the software.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.880]   It's always up to date, so security is not an issue.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.080]   I love that.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.760]   You'll never run out of bandwidth because Squarespace has an amazing virtual server technology
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:23.400]   that just keeps the sites going and going and going.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.160]   And it starts at $12 a month for hosting and software.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.920]   The new Squarespace 6 is just about to come out.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:33.280]   So you're going to want to check that out to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.840]   Just click that try a free button, set up your new Squarespace site.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.840]   Do what Alex Lindsey does.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.960]   You know Alex went to a restaurant that didn't have a website, created a Squarespace site
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.240]   for them and just said, "Here's the password.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   It's yours.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   Use it.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.120]   It's a website."
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.120]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.940]   So Apple, iCloud, with lots of rumors Apple apparently made a deal and now has made a
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.160]   deal with all four music labels.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.160]   So is it a music service?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.440]   What would that look like in your mind?
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.280]   Is it straight streaming?
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.840]   Is it like Amazon's?
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.480]   Well, so there's two guys out there now, Amazon's cloud service and Google's music
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.680]   service.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.720]   Both Amazon and Google allow you to upload all your music to their service and then
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   stream it.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.280]   Now Amazon has a limit of 20 gigs for free if you buy in Amazon's song, 5 gigs if you
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   don't.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.400]   Google has a 20,000 song limit right now.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   It's free but it's in beta.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.040]   I don't know if they're going to charge later.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.920]   So it's a streaming service but you have to, I mean it took me days to upload 6,000 songs
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.480]   but now on all my phones I can listen to my music big deal.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.480]   It did.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   It took two or three days.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.240]   How much music do you need on your phone?
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.520]   Well this is 7,000 songs but it's not on the phone.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.520]   That's the beauty.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.520]   I can listen to everything I can collect.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520]   Okay.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   I also have MOG.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:53.320]   If you have Rhapsody, MOG, RDO, any of these services you have 8 million songs you can stream.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.280]   So I'm not sure what the advantage there is.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.440]   Google does not sell music.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.440]   Amazon does.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.040]   Amazon decided not to license this service.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.520]   They're in trouble with the music industry.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.360]   Sony says they're going to sue.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   Apple made the deal.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   So Apple's got to offer something.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.600]   Do you think Apple will offer this magical thing where you push a button and everything
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.800]   is just instantly on the cloud?
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   Well that's the question.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.280]   I mean one of the problems I don't think anybody's solved yet is all the stuff I've
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.320]   bought is in all those different places.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   That's ugly.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.960]   Can somebody please consolidate this?
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.520]   Well I think Apple has an absolute interest to do something that makes you want to only
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.520]   buy from iTunes.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.440]   They've got to be threatened by Amazon at this point.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.480]   Okay so here's one rumor that I think is interesting that sort of goes back to this
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.000]   and also has a consumer play for Apple.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.120]   This whole Mac rumors has it that this is all going to be driven off of the time capsule,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.520]   wireless router, hard drive.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.720]   I'd pray that's not true.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:50.680]   So that you basically sync to that hard drive and all of your license stuff is somehow held
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   to that.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.120]   It's kind of mirrored from there.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.640]   Yeah and that that wireless link syncs within your home.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.560]   It would sell more Apple hardware.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.280]   Right well that's what I always go back to Steve Jobs saying there's got to be a go-to-market
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.880]   strategy for any service.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.960]   I disagree because a hardware component.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.200]   No I think Apple's happy if you're buying music from iTunes don't you?
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.040]   I don't think that's enough of their business to make it such a fundamental part.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.920]   I mean this may help sell more hardware but I think he's always looking for a direct
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.200]   hardware play.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.200]   It's a non-starter.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   Yeah I agree with Becky.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   It's a non-starter then.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.880]   Who is going to buy a time capsule just to use iCloud?
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   Nobody.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   I don't know.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.600]   I have hundreds of dollars of music I can't freaking find.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.600]   Hundreds of dollars?
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.600]   Holy crap.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.000]   That's one of the albums.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.520]   Holy crap.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.560]   Most of those downloaded free from Napster that's why it's worth so little.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:51.320]   It's so bad I never stole music and I have hundreds maybe two hundreds.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.560]   But so my point is that it would be so nice to consolidate all of that and have it done
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.840]   wirelessly that I would shell out 50 or 60 bucks for a router hard drive combo that did
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.640]   all of that syncing from my iTunes account.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.640]   Well time capsule.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   60 bucks good luck.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   Well I don't know how much it costs.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   But anyways I think.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   Hundreds of dollars.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.840]   Hundreds of dollars John.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.160]   But I'm kind of digressing but that's like one of those solutions that I think would be
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.680]   the added value that would make me go oh thank you Lord.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.360]   That they would actually that you'd have to buy the time.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   I don't know.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.880]   I think that rumor is wrong.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880]   Okay that's fine.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.720]   Two hundred ninety nine dollars for a time capsule.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   Oh that's a good idea.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.360]   What is the deal with music from Google?
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.360]   What do you mean what is the deal?
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.360]   So how does it work?
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.240]   What do you explain to why I would be want the service?
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.800]   Because now that I've uploaded everything to Google now on my Android phone or my Google
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.560]   tablet doesn't work on iOS yet I can stream any song that I own presumably I own stuff
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:56.720]   that maybe is an on-mog or Rhapsody or RDO or Spotify or one of those radio services.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.680]   But I have access to my collection my personal collection without putting it on the phone
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:05.120]   so the amount of you know storage on the phone is irrelevant.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.440]   You know it's not a great I mean I don't know what the play is.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.320]   You know I make sense for me for Amazon because Amazon encourage that way you buy a record
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.800]   like when Lady Gaga was ninety nine cents.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   That's a huge button.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.160]   I pushed the button that download was slow.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:21.920]   I didn't care because it's stored in my locker right so it's available to me anyway.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.800]   And so that makes sense from an Amazon point of view.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.480]   They're selling more records it's a kind of an added benefit.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.600]   First of all I think iCloud is more than music.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.800]   It's going to be mobile me it's going to be reinvented mobile me but so it's going to
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.680]   be mail it's going to be picture storage.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.280]   It might have some real advantages and I think this is where it apples big advantages if it
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:43.240]   ties into the iOS and becomes now storage for the iPad as well as your desktop.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:48.440]   Because that's a big problem with the iPad is you don't you don't where's my stuff.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.960]   So if suddenly everything that's on your iPad is duplicated on your iCloud is visible
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.640]   on your desktop they you know it looks like there's a rumor that you know if you look
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.280]   in the code or I think it was actually a leak in iTunes that there is going to be over
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.440]   the air app updates on iPhone and iOS 5.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.360]   Maybe iCloud kind of ties in this kind of this whole idea of no more connection to your
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.560]   computer it's just kind of all is there.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.280]   That makes sense to me I don't see a compelling music service from Apple I can't think of
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.920]   what Apple could do that would make me go wow I got to get this.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.520]   Well maybe it's just catch up.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.080]   Yeah I mean everybody else is doing it.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:29.400]   And I also I'm a while back I said that as soon as Amazon opened the door Google and
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:34.160]   Apple would be smart to just pile on and get it all out done once because then all those
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.360]   music companies are going to have to go after all these big players.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.120]   But look at something like Dropbox Apple's got to be looking at Dropbox which is very
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:47.880]   popular it's used a lot by apps on iPhone and iPad because it's a way of getting data
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.280]   out of the iPad kind of automatically you could put it on the Dropbox and it's visible
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.880]   on your desktop as well Dropbox is a great service.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.360]   It's pretty expensive it's more than more than mobile me it's over $120 for sure.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   $250 gigs.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   Yeah but it's free up to two which for the average.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   Up to two.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   But for the average Joe that's not as well.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   Two is not going to last very long.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.840]   Okay I'm going to give you a couple of things that I think would make iCloud compelling.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.880]   One is a Dropbox style service that lets me kind of sink all my data across all my platforms.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:18.760]   Two would be two would be and I think this is more important than music.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.720]   TVs and movies.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.160]   What if I buy a movie on iTunes and now it's available to all my devices streamed from my
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   iCloud.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.320]   That's what I want.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.960]   That I want.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.720]   I never have to download it.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.160]   That gives me that.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.800]   And doesn't Hollywood want that?
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.640]   That would make sense though because there's a trend right now and you see it with a I
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:42.040]   don't know if it's Comcast or one of these cable companies they show this ad where you
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.240]   can stop the.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   X&B.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.800]   In one room you can stop your DVR and then you can go to your bedroom and start it up
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.840]   from there on that screen.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:57.800]   The idea of the mobile of being able to move around the content from here to there is very
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.440]   common thought right now.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.960]   So that would that what you describe makes a lot of sense that that would actually happen.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.720]   Buy once watch anywhere.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   Right.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   And that's what we want.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.720]   Listen.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.640]   I mean all we want is to be able to watch our stuff.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:15.520]   You know where's where's the pain point right now if you buy a DVD you've got a illegally
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.000]   rip it and put it on your iPod or iPhone.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   But I already have the DVD.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   I mean it's just a pain.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.080]   Maybe this is Apple just finally saying okay we're going to stop presuming everyone's a
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.080]   criminal.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.680]   Well it's not Apple you got to convince us the movie.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.680]   Fair enough.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.680]   Fair enough.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.140]   But but they have maybe the leverage now to make these deals and say okay let's just
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.880]   presume everyone is doing it legally because it is easier.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:42.320]   So we are going to give people the ability to share this across their multiple devices
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.080]   because we know that every family these days is a multi-device family.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   Right.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   And we want our data there too.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.280]   Now I don't know if people will trust their data but I mean they trust Dropbox I guess
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.680]   they trust Apple more than anybody else.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   Well I don't know about that but they definitely trust you know Amazon and they trust I think
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.800]   we've seen from the phone data logs that people don't trust them that much that's
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.920]   certainly a black guy.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   But most people.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.920]   Most people.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.520]   I mean Apple I would have all the brands out there Apple has a lot of good will going
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.520]   forward.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.680]   I'd be interested to see what what are you waving at?
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.440]   Nothing I just saw myself.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.440]   Hey first time on TV.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.440]   On the TV.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.440]   You look like kids.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:28.400]   I just saw myself on the TV.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.160]   And so now you realize you're wearing a big bright yellow striped shirt.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.560]   Doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.080]   It's a referee for this show.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:44.600]   All right I want to talk about the bubble it's back baby in just a bit before we do though
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.000]   Audible dot com.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.160]   I don't know what to say except that I love Audible I think everybody should have
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.320]   Audible subscriptions if you're not an audible user.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.160]   Why the heck not.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.760]   I'm going on a trip to LA.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:03.920]   What is the first thing I do before I pack my bag I download my books so I can listen.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.000]   Now the nice thing I have an Android phone if you have an iPhone is that audible app
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.600]   there.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.840]   You have your whole library available to you.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.440]   So cool.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:21.080]   So you know if you can see what you got on your library and if you know you can listen
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:28.640]   to it this is kind of iCloud for books really this is my Android I can go to my library
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.360]   and see all the books I've ever bought ever on audible dot com I could scroll through
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:40.960]   them all and if there's a if there's a if there's a book I I want to re listen to I
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.320]   could just start listening to it right away there's sleep which is very cool.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:50.880]   I just I don't love Audible so I downloaded the temporal void and the last book of the
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.800]   temporal of the void trilogy because I know I'm going to probably get through that.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.200]   You just kind of never run out of great things to listen to.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.640]   There's over 500 books down my audible library I've been a subscriber since 2000.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.720]   I want you to give it a try.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.800]   Now here's how you get two books absolutely free.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:14.400]   You just go to audible dot com slash twit to that's a special URL just for you and you
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.920]   can pick two books from all of their great books.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.760]   You listen to audible books Becky ever you travel a lot I would be shocked if you didn't.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.440]   I'm really busy playing plants versus zombies.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.640]   Oh you really know I'm on to tofu now this this is really about using your brain instead
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.080]   of just letting it vegetate.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.840]   I wanted to listen to bossy pants by team.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.560]   Yeah she reads it and I heard it was fantastic.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:45.080]   And so that's one that I have really put on the on the list of I want to listen to see
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.640]   the problem is you know you're busy I'm busy we got kids we got lots to do we've got jobs
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.000]   so it's hard to find the time to read and yet reading to me is something that really
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   feeds my soul.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.120]   And when you are commuting in detect TV you lived and died off these books.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   Yeah I had to.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.120]   You were in the car so much.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.600]   Two hours at least two hours a day.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.400]   And I mean so many people these days are commuting that you and it's it's actually a
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.320]   great buffer it's a way to wind down and be ready to walk in the door and handle you
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.080]   know the kids the family.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.080]   Sometimes they just stay in the car.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.920]   I know that's a great place to live.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:20.560]   So there that would be a good pick there you know you get two books at audible.com/twittubosy
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.200]   pants would be good Rob Lowe's got a new tell all.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.360]   I kind of want to listen to this if you really want to go trashy you can do that.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.360]   Oh hello.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.360]   Go trashy.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.000]   I think you're talking to yeah.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Your face upscale for me.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.080]   But see sometimes you want to get intellectual so they've got history at least the new David
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:43.480]   Macollegus came out about Paris and all the American expats who went to Paris and and
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.960]   you know the whole cultural scene there.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.680]   Yeah you really sound interested in that.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.440]   I kind of wear my caffeinated French pants when I was in that one.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.760]   It's called The Greater Journey, Americans in Paris.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.840]   So I like to listen to a lot of history.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   I know John does.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.240]   John's into Civil War history.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.800]   Like John was going to write a book about the Civil War.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   Did you know that?
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   I did not.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.320]   So he's a he's a very literate person.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:11.320]   You might like this Sun Zu at Gettysburg ancient military wisdom in the modern world.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.320]   Boy that'll that's uplifting listening.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.920]   Oh God.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:22.060]   What if Robert E Lee had listened to Sun Zu before he attacked the Union lines and pick
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.060]   its charge.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.480]   What if I'll stay up all night.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.120]   You know what's interesting about that kind of juxtaposition.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.760]   I think this is the latest thing going on where you just do wild stuff which reminds me
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.560]   of the upcoming movie Aliens versus Cowboys.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.080]   I mean who doesn't want to go.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.600]   I love that premise.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.120]   I can't wait to see that movie.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.120]   Oh yeah.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.040]   The idea is this guy was abducted by aliens in the cowboy era but nobody knew about aliens.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   Right.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.800]   So he thought the anal probe was just a good time.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.040]   Is that the is that John is that basically it.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   Something like that.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.040]   He comes back with a weapon.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.040]   Oh.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.560]   So he's got some high tech weapon that he can use to shoot at the aliens.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.480]   It just looks like a great film.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   Wow.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.480]   I want to see like all these other films that what we saw in the trailer.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.160]   That's pretty much it.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.160]   Do you like Eric Von Danneken?
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.760]   I'm sure that your friend Adam Curry believes in the chariots of the gods.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.160]   They've got the full Danneken series.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.800]   This is just comedic but I enjoy it.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:29.080]   You know he believes that the ancient gods the Mayan gods and everything were actually
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.080]   aliens.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   Oh yeah.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.160]   And chariots of the gods.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.160]   That's fun.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.720]   There's great sci-fi too.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.760]   I tell you audible.com/twitto.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.520]   I'm not going to tell you what to listen to.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.880]   Go there, pick two books and they're yours for free.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.000]   Once you go to audible.com/twitto you'll sign up for the platinum account.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   That's two books a month.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.400]   Your first book is free.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.440]   If you're watching Game of Thrones and you haven't read the book you really ought to do
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.680]   that.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.680]   And you can get the effect.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.640]   I think all five of the songs, Song of Ice and Fire books are on there.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.280]   Are there four or five?
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.160]   These writing the fifth now.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.360]   And Roy Dottreece who reads these.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.360]   Oh my God.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.560]   These are great.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.560]   Highly recommended.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.080]   If you like that HBO series get the book.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.400]   Audible.com/twitto.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:17.960]   Two great books are waiting for you for free right now.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.520]   Snag them.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.280]   Thanks Audible.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.160]   So Groupon, I think this is great stuff.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   Let's talk about gossip.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.160]   Talk about trash.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:31.040]   Groupon issued the S1 for their IPO.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.680]   John you're our financial wizard.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   So we'll let you.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.200]   Do I look like a financial wizard?
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   Do you?
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   Strangely yes.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   Well, okay.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.200]   It's the crazy hair.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   I bet a poor diet would help.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.760]   He's kind of the Jim Kramer of tech.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.760]   Go on.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:56.680]   So Groupon is many say the fastest growing company in the history of mankind.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:01.640]   I would like to say that I am going to be so wrong because one of my predictions at
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:05.920]   the end of last year was that Groupon would live to rude the day they turned down $5
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.280]   billion from Google.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   Six.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.280]   Six.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.280]   Six billion.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.480]   I don't know if they turned it down or Google had a cold feet though.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.800]   Was it the Groupon said no?
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.320]   I always thought the common five had the number wrong.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   So I trust people.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   I thought they had.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.160]   If they get the price that they're asking on the stock market, their valuation will
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.240]   be $20 billion.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.760]   But here's the thing.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.720]   They've never made penny one.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   And I don't see what's proprietary about what they do.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   That's the other problem.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.720]   They have 7,000 employees.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.320]   Half of them are local salespeople.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:42.160]   For those who don't know, I guess there's people who don't know, Groupon is a catalog,
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.600]   online catalog service, right?
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.160]   Basically?
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.960]   It's a deal site.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:48.960]   It's a deal site.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.960]   You go and you get these.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   It's not catalog coupon.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.960]   I mean, yeah.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   It's not a coupon.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.680]   It's a coupon, kind of a coupon deal of the day.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   It's Groupon.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.760]   Which are all done by guys on the street.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   I mean, there's no technology.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.520]   Well, it was supposed to be Group buying.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.240]   But is it really Group buying?
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.120]   Well, it's like, is the deal live?
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.840]   If enough people got in on the deal.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:06.880]   Oh, is that how it works?
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.120]   You have to have the deal go live.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.120]   Yeah, then the deal goes--
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.800]   That's what they use the technology for.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.800]   That's their angle.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:17.080]   But in order for this to work, you've got to have local salespeople everywhere, right?
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.920]   Because you've got to go everywhere.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.920]   And I'm logged in.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:27.840]   Okay, let's go see my deal of the week here in the beautiful Sonoma County area.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.920]   This is the kind of deal you get.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:33.560]   Red Beacon, $25.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:38.440]   I only pay $25 for $50 worth of yard work.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.440]   Wow.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.440]   Wow.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.480]   Now, I better hurry up because there's only two days left.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.040]   And already 50 people have bought it.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.040]   I see.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.240]   So the deal wasn't on until 25 people bought it.
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.920]   See, the deal is always on.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.920]   It seems that way now.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   Yeah, because there's so many people.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   It depends on if you're in a smaller area.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.320]   Okay, that doesn't ring your chime.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.560]   How about this?
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:01.040]   Admission for two to the GLBT History Museum.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.880]   Usually $10, now just five.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.880]   Uh...
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.040]   I didn't even know there was such a museum.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   Okay, wait a minute.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.040]   No, you want more?
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.800]   How about $20 worth of Salvadoran cuisine for just $10?
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.560]   Now, those kind of deals do well.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.040]   Like the gap, the big one, as I recall.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   Do you go for these though?
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   I mean, really?
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.840]   Am I just too rich that I don't have to think about this?
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.560]   I've heard stories about a lot of people who do this and what does well, especially with
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:30.120]   living social, which is their competitor, is fun stuff.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   So I just...
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.120]   High-acting trip.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.200]   I'm just not going to run out and Gil gets Salvadoran cuisine south of Berkeley because
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.600]   I can get a $10 off.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   But people will.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   The gas is more than that.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:42.760]   Fair enough, but if you knew that you were going to shop at the gap and they're giving
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:47.440]   you a straight 50% off kind of deal, you give us $10, we'll give you $20 gift card for
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.440]   the gap.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.440]   That's a good deal.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.960]   Look, I can get $150 worth of Hoot Judkin's furniture for just $60.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:58.640]   The point is there are gill-gillians of these services now, probably the biggest competitor
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.640]   is Facebook.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   Yeah, Facebook deals.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.640]   Facebook deals.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.880]   Yeah, but you know who's got a real good angle on this and somebody in the chat room
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.280]   pointed it out is Google offers.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   Mmm.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:12.200]   So you got living social, you got Facebook, you got Google.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.000]   There's a lot of competition.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.400]   You may have mentioned the biggest tipping point for Groupon though is that they have
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.320]   the men on the street, the people on the street.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.320]   That they've...
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.880]   The biggest thing about the infrastructure to sell the deals, but the thing is, is this
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.960]   is not necessarily like the full or brushman going door to door to businesses.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.400]   You could set this up, you know, pretty easily.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.040]   Right, but there is a barrier to entry because you do need local salespeople.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:39.240]   I mean, this company's gone in three years from zero to 7,000 employees.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.240]   Here's the kind of...
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.240]   You know, there's a lot of red flags.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.240]   If you...
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.760]   I'm not an investor, I don't invest in tech stocks.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:48.640]   I don't allow myself to for editorial reasons and I would lose my shirt if I did because
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   I...
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.640]   That's the real reason.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.400]   I certainly have no clue what I'm talking about.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.680]   But there are a lot of red flags.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.200]   For instance, what about this?
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:03.360]   In the recent funding rounds, because this is all in the S1, right?
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:11.360]   Groupon raised $1 billion across its Series F and Series G funding rounds.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:16.760]   Of that, 86% was paid out to Groupon's directors, officers and stockholders.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:21.560]   They took of the billion, 946 million dollars off the table.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.560]   How is this game?
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.560]   Tonsie scheme.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.560]   They took it.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:29.640]   They kept 151 million, you know, to run the company.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.000]   Boy, I'd love to be in this ball.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   How do you get in this deal?
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   How do you do that?
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   We don't have to.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.600]   You're on your way, Leo, with the whole operation.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:41.200]   They lost something like $300 million last year.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.680]   They lost $110 million last quarter.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   They're not profitable.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.920]   They've never been profitable and they have a huge run rate.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:52.720]   Well, this could be interesting because, you know, in terms of maybe my projection is
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:58.040]   not as far off as I thought, is they're only looking to raise a billion, right?
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   Right.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.320]   And if their valuation is 20...
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.440]   The billions only going to last them a couple of years.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.560]   At this rate.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.240]   So, but I mean, I'm wondering if they're freaking out and doing it just to get the money out
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   now.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.440]   LinkedIn had a popular and successful IPO.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.440]   Oh, great.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.440]   Now is the time.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.440]   People are mentioning the bubble world all the time.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.440]   This feels like the bubble.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.920]   If we don't do it now, we're not going to make any money.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920]   Yes.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.080]   It's what they could be thinking.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   But here's the problem.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.800]   If the stock market says, "Wait a minute.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.880]   This is not a good deal."
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.120]   They could really couldn't this really hurt them?
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.120]   Ha ha.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.760]   A rejection could come true.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.840]   Our financial guy, oh, I'm sorry, he's tucking in his pants.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.200]   Hey, I'll tell you something.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.520]   The LinkedIn thing's kind of triggered a bunch of these deals.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.640]   Everyone's gone a little crazy into LinkedIn collapses.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.160]   I mean, let's face the way it seems.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.080]   LinkedIn's got a vital business, don't they?
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.280]   Yeah, it alerts you when someone's going to quit.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.680]   True dollar business is not a stock that's going to be selling for $80 with the price
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.240]   earnings that's over the moon.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240]   How about this?
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.240]   How about Zinga?
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.240]   Wouldn't you buy stock in Zinga?
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.680]   Now, there's their coin money.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.640]   I just saw it the next day.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.360]   Well, I don't know.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.920]   I think Zinga's got something going.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.080]   Zinga just screams out second life to me.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.840]   It just feels like that.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.840]   It feels like that.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.680]   Apparently, Zinga, according to Bloomberg, is in talks with Goldman Sachs.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:21.720]   There's a name that will live in infamy to lead its initial public offering and provide
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.880]   a credit line of more than $1 billion to help make acquisitions.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.360]   But, you know, Zinga's numbers are down.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.360]   Really?
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.960]   Their overall numbers are down.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:35.360]   What I recall was that their farm bill numbers were down and they weren't that they weren't
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.600]   growing at the same rates as they had.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.720]   Zinga has 242 million active users every month on Facebook.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.800]   That's more than a third of the Facebook population.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:51.640]   I have serious doubts about their total active user base.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.440]   I think that number is misrepresentation.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.840]   Also, I think people phase out of these games.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840]   I mean...
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   It's hard to.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.840]   I quit.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.600]   Let me tell you, when I quit Rerule, which is kind of like farm bill on the iPad, people
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.560]   got really mad at me, including family members, because I was no longer helping them.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.720]   They're paying their farms.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.400]   There is this social burden.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.400]   As farm bills are much worse.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.400]   Don't just get a life.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.400]   That's what I did.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   I said, "Get a life."
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400]   It's not a real farm.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.400]   Hello, people.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.200]   John, John, these are emotions you're unfamiliar with.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.800]   Hold just quite a bit back there.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.000]   It's a word called community, John.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   How about this?
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Does this baby look for...
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Oh, no!
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.840]   Just like McCauley-Caulkin.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.440]   Oh, I think he's going more going for the scream.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.640]   Okay, more than sure, McCauley-Caulkin.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640]   Whatever.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:44.520]   Zinga's valued at $8.2 billion on SharePost, SharePost, which is private stock sales.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:49.520]   That would make it number two in games after Activision Blizzard electronic arts is third
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.760]   at $8 billion.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.320]   I wish I could come up with these numbers, but when I was doing the Gaga, you know, Gaga
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320]   had created a farm.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.320]   Gagaville.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.320]   Yeah, Gagaville.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.120]   When I was doing that, I was researching Zinga, and I saw that their overall numbers
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.560]   had taken a dip, and I thought...
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.560]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.560]   Hey, here we go.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.560]   Ah, some crush.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.480]   I don't mean to be harsh, but I don't trust Mark Pankas as far as you could throw him.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.480]   That's the CEO of...
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480]   He's just...
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.280]   He's had some questionable comments in the past, and...
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280]   Who I need to...
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.280]   Who?
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.280]   Mark Pankas, Zinga's CEO.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.280]   You know where Zinga is?
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.120]   Yeah, it's in our old tech TV building.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120]   Our old tech TV building.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120]   So what could be wrong with them?
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.520]   Oh, I mean, come on, they're just faded to be so successful.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.080]   Nice, nice people they'll do as well as we did.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   It's cursed at building.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.000]   I tell you.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.320]   So you want to get irate, France is banned Facebook and Twitter from news shows.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.520]   If you're wearing a burka.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.520]   No.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.520]   Is that me?
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.520]   Okay, get this.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.080]   Apparently in 1992 there was a decree by the French government forbidding the promotion
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.360]   of commercial enterprises on news programs.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.000]   That seems reasonable.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.440]   You know, objective journalism, you shouldn't be promoting commercial enterprise and so
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.440]   forth.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:03.600]   However, they're using this to decree, this is the France, the Consai, superior, the
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.640]   Laudio Visuell, C.S.I.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.040]   They're using this to tell, you know how on CNN they'll say, follow us on Twitter at
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.640]   the Rick Sanchez or whatever it is.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.240]   They're not, they cannot do that now.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.000]   And France, the government says you may not do that.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.520]   Well, you can't say our Facebook page.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.640]   You can't promote that on the newscast.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:29.960]   Christine Kelly from the CSA said, why give preference to Facebook, which is worth billions
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:36.360]   of dollars when there are many other social networks that are struggling for recognition.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.160]   This would be a distortion of competition.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.800]   If we allow Facebook and Twitter to be sat, I think they call it looked with their to be
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.200]   sat it on air.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.520]   It is opening up and Doris box.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.880]   Other social networks who complain to us saying, why not us?
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.600]   That makes no sense.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.760]   This is why actually I love France, but talk about a nanny government.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.280]   Yeah, it's just ridiculous.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.640]   John, are you writing a book?
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.280]   What are you doing there?
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.280]   You can't hear that.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.280]   I had a mic.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280]   I can see you.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.640]   It looks like you're doing something in your lap and I'm giving you the charitable.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640]   Hey, there people.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.160]   I'm doing the charitable.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.160]   Ouch.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.880]   Guess that it's typing.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:29.280]   So by the way, just to do a side here, I promise my editor at MarketWatch that I would help
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.280]   him.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280]   Yes.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.960]   He has really interesting poignant, especially for people who invest or care about the stocks.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.640]   He has poignant treat tweets.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.160]   He needs to be followed.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.800]   Decalaway.com or at decalaway.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.680]   Like call away.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.600]   Wait, you're telling me.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.400]   This guy said to you.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400]   No, no.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.680]   I said to him the next time you're on Twitter, would you please tell everybody to follow
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.680]   me on Twitter?
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.840]   No, I said your numbers stink.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.240]   I'm going to get you some more numbers.
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.760]   I didn't tell him how.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.840]   He only has 1,218 followers.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.840]   It's terrible.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.600]   And you say this guy is worth following?
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.840]   Well, yeah, he's the editor of MarketWatch.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.840]   I mean, why aren't people following you?
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.840]   What is MarketWatch again?
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.080]   Oh, that was good.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.080]   I like that.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.080]   She basically.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.360]   Yeah, and you write for them, right?
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.920]   You do a lot of writing for them.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.840]   I got nothing else to do.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.840]   I like them.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.280]   No, I read your columns in there.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.400]   I'll tell you what, John, right now, just for you, watch this, press that button.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.400]   Follow.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.240]   I'm now following him.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.480]   You just follow him and everyone will follow him because you're the man.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   Stuckstart.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.440]   You have actual numbers, real numbers.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.440]   I crossed 300,000 the other day.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.440]   You did?
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.440]   But those are real numbers.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.440]   Those aren't phony baloney numbers that some of these people have.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.320]   Yeah, that 10 million people who follow Lady Gaga, those aren't real people.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.680]   John gets all up in arms about fake followers.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.680]   This is big.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.720]   Well, there was for a while because a couple of years ago, remember that Twitter did that
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   suggested users list.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.960]   So there was some inflation, but I think now there's no inflation.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   Some inflation?
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.280]   Well, Lady Gaga, I think genuinely.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.800]   Lady Gaga, I don't care about it.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   She's going to get big.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.480]   She deserves her 10 million followers.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.320]   That's in fact, that hardly seems like enough.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.680]   No, she needs, she needs more.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.280]   She should have more.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.720]   She's making $100 million this year.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.720]   Wow.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720]   Holy crap.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.480]   Now Justin Bieber having 10 million followers.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480]   Ah, okay.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.800]   I'll give him that.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.400]   But really Kim Kardashian?
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.680]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.680]   I know.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.480]   I just, I can't, I can't buy that.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.080]   So I want John C. de Vorex opinion.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.080]   Yes.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.600]   This guy has my MacBook.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.920]   Did you follow this, John?
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920]   Did you see this guy?
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.120]   The Mac MacBook guy?
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.120]   What was your initial thoughts?
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.120]   It's about it.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.120]   First, I thought it was a hoax.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.280]   That's a lot of people on March 21st.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.800]   This guy writes on his thumb blog.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.760]   This guy has my Macbook.com as a website.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.100]   My Mac book was stolen in Oakland.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.200]   I reported the crime to the police.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.480]   Even told them where it was, but they couldn't help me do the lack of resources.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.480]   That's true, right?
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.640]   Hold on a sec that that's where I stop.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.000]   Now I found out that this problem, although I've never been able to get a hold of this
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.560]   guy, even though he says you can get a hold of me if you're with the media.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.560]   I couldn't get a hold of him.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.560]   Worley's talked to him.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.560]   Worley knows him.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.760]   But Worley's best friends with him now.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.760]   Oh yeah.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   Yeah, we're VFFs.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.080]   But I, I just, here's my problem.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:34.320]   In Oakland, they, you know, if you go to a bar station in Oakland, there's a red zone
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.160]   where buses come in, says bus stop.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.040]   In fact, some of them are even red, just says bus stop.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.800]   If you drive in there and stop to pick somebody up into that zone, it's as you, I'm going
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.800]   to speed trap.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.800]   Hey, homie, that's Bart police.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.880]   Do you remember what they did?
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.240]   I'm just saying, Bart police ain't Oakland police.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   Okay.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:56.640]   There are, they're, I'm telling you, there are, there are Oakland is a, is a Bart police
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.880]   that set the parking meters to end at eight at night.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.200]   Oakland has got time to give people tickets.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.320]   There are 20 or for parking in weird places.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.680]   They have resources.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.840]   The fact of the matter is they'll take your money if you've got a parking ticket because
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.600]   that's a revenue stream, but to help some poor guy get his laptop back, forget it.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   We got no resources.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.560]   So in other words, the taxpayers are paying for the police to not do their job.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.920]   It's ridiculous that they would say that to this guy.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.760]   It's an outrage at the police.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.040]   Especially when it's handed over in a silver platter.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.040]   I agree with you.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.040]   It's unbelievable.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.040]   I agree with you.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.840]   There are 2,400 property crimes thefts in Oakland every month.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.320]   There are three officers on the property crimes division.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.720]   They don't care.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.240]   They don't care about their own citizens.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.240]   It's not that bad.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   You said 2,400 a month.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   A month.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.360]   So that's only 30, 80 a day.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360]   There's three officers.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.200]   They could investigate these.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   It's not terrible.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   So this guy cares.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.320]   The Oakland police do not care about their own citizens.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.720]   So we should go back and get.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.280]   He got his, but they did it.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.000]   Once he created it, got all the publicity, he got his money.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.360]   Then they rushed to the rescue.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.360]   Okay.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.120]   But let's, so the thing that I thought was interesting about the hoax and so many people
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120]   thought this.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.120]   So he has this app.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.000]   He has this app called hidden on his map.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.480]   These are well known apps that take pictures of the perpetrator.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.520]   Yeah, just like it was a.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   Oh, you think this is an ad?
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:20.280]   So a lot of people thought this was a viral marketing boy because he started publishing
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:25.520]   pictures of the guy who supposedly had the map.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.080]   He does have a link to hidden right there on the front.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.720]   And you know, there is a certain similarity to the sites.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   It doesn't.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.720]   Whoa.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.160]   And I thought, no way, no way.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.520]   And I honestly believe they are not tied.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.000]   And I did the work and I have done the gumshoeing.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Now, wait a minute.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.760]   Let's ask the audience because so if you scroll down, this is what kind of makes me
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.440]   think it's suspicious.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.640]   This is the guy supposedly.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.520]   This is the guy who stole his MacBook.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.520]   Let's just scroll down a little bit.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.840]   You could not have a creepier.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.800]   What the hell and what kind of couches that and why is the MacBook gone while he's sleeping?
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800]   No, that's.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.800]   But my theory is he was like watching YouTube.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.800]   That is a good picture.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.200]   He's in his bed with no shirt on.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200]   What kind of bed is that?
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.920]   And you cannot see his crumbs.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.480]   This guy, this is a nice bed.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.480]   This guy's got some money.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.400]   He's not got a good haircut.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   He's got some sick.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.400]   No.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.320]   And as many people in the comment threads also noted, it seems that he has a tooth abscess.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.320]   But that's beyond the ball.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320]   Oh my God.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.320]   Okay.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.320]   That's not good.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   Okay.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.240]   So anyway, there's something going on in there.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   But the.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.720]   So I was like, he's like a cab driver, right?
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720]   So I'll.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.280]   But at this point, I call the, this guy has my MacBook when there's lost his MacBook.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.760]   And we call my producer calls the Oakland police there.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.280]   They go, oh, let's look and see if there was a case filed.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.280]   Hey, good morning.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.280]   America's on the line.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.120]   Sure enough, they find the case file and the public information officer goes, uh oh,
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.680]   we should have done this one.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.880]   Oh, so you are the one who got it.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.600]   Well, you're probably the one that triggered it.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.600]   I know.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.120]   But the point was when you call just curious, when you say, when you call, do you say, hi,
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.720]   is Becky Worley from ABC's Good Morning America?
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.520]   Yeah, that deep too.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.080]   So seriously, that's what you say.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.440]   And I set up really straight.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.920]   Like, hey, hey, this is Becky Worley.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920]   You might have heard of me.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.160]   I'm on Good Morning America.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.040]   Me and George Stephanopoulos wanted to know.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.000]   We're but now I tell you, I'm sorry.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.520]   I asked me to ask you people do call you back.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.520]   Yeah, GMA.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.840]   They call you back.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.920]   So anyways, within three hours, they had the guy in custody.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920]   So it's your fault.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.520]   My yeah, so I mean, but it was fascinating.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.320]   How many people we should have we should have done something about that one.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.320]   She did.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.120]   It's a scandal.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.600]   I mean, that the location data he had, he had an exact address.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.280]   He knew the guy's employment.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.320]   In fact, that's the way they caught the man who had the Mac book.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.000]   Yeah, they called up the cab service.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.120]   He worked for and he rolled up on OPD in a limo.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.120]   Oh, they're like, yeah, get out of the stretch.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   Wow.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.400]   Interesting to me, how many people immediate first thought was that the whole campaign
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.440]   and the guy who supposedly lost his Mac book, people thought that it was a viral campaign
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.440]   for the app.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.400]   Now he's on this guy's on Twitter.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.400]   Do we know who he works for?
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.880]   Yeah, he's the real deal.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   I went to him.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.040]   No, I met him.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.680]   He's a really nice genuine seeming guy who's a human.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.000]   I'm following him on Twitter.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.200]   He's an HCI designer.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200]   Joshua Kaufman.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.680]   Yeah, super nice guy.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.920]   And he's very mild mannered.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.040]   So it wasn't like some cowboy and I met him in his office and it was the real deal.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.760]   Oh, look, he says here, good morning America just called.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.320]   I better make sure there's somebody.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.320]   Oh, whatever.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.240]   This is good.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.760]   He actually doesn't talk about all this.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.560]   But it made me really nervous until they said, yeah, we found the driver with the Mac book
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.360]   in his custody that I was really concerned that we were getting punked.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.200]   Yeah, but it's just the sets kind of what it's come to.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.800]   He has a link on his Twitter for the Google Analytics for his tumble log.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.000]   Yeah, that makes him nerdy, right?
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.160]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.840]   Traffic sources for this guy has my back book from Google Analytics.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.080]   This guy, I like this guy.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.080]   He's one of us.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.240]   He is and that's I had to kind of get that.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.240]   So it's not a scam.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240]   It's not a hoax.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.240]   It's real.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.960]   You might think it was kind of his great viral marketing for him.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.720]   Yeah, you know, you got to be skeptical no matter.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.160]   Yeah, unless our job.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.840]   But you did to your credit.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.840]   They say nobody does reporting anymore.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.840]   Becky Worley does report it.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.640]   That's because I was worried that if I got it wrong, John C. Devorak would come after
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   me on no agenda.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   I would.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.680]   So let's see.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:40.000]   Percentage of most of his hits were just direct people somehow.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.680]   Somebody said the name of the URL.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.080]   Yeah, then Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, dig.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.680]   Hacker News, San Francisco Chronicle way, way down there.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.680]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.680]   Yahoo News.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:59.160]   It was one of the fastest viral news points I've seen in a long time.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.680]   Yeah, well, it's great story.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.000]   It was the same day that Intel did that Museum of Me.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   Did you see that?
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   Yes.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   It was an app for Facebook.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   Did I see it?
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   I tweeted it.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   It was incredible.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   What did you describe it for people?
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.280]   I could do it for them if they want.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.960]   It's basically an app for Facebook, right?
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.960]   It's an Intel ad.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.760]   It's not a Facebook ad.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.800]   It's not exactly because it's on Intel, Intel.com/MuseumOfMe.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.560]   What you do is you go there and it connects to your Facebook account and it downloads all
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.280]   of your Facebook data.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.040]   And then it makes a very heartwarming, very tough.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.920]   You'd like this, John, very touching Museum of Yourself.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.560]   Do it with your fake self.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.560]   I should do it with John C. de Vorac.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.760]   That would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.880]   The one on the fake one on the--
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.760]   The funny thing about this is that-- let me connect it to my Facebook page.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.760]   It's brilliant.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.120]   It's the first ad I've ever seen.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.560]   A lot of ads are targeted at you.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.280]   This is the first ad I've ever seen that actually is you.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.760]   So it's gathering data now from my Facebook page.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   All your photos.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.240]   It gets all the photos and stuff.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.560]   It's actually some nice music in it.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.160]   I'm surprised you haven't seen this, John.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.840]   This seems like this would be right up your alley.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.160]   It's taken all of my images.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.760]   We're going to go visit my museum.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.760]   Would you like to?
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   I'd like to.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760]   Who are you, Leon?
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.240]   Well, Intel seems to know.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:22.680]   Welcome to the museum of me.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.200]   I'm--
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:23.880]   For Leo.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.000]   Leo La Porte.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.640]   Welcome to my exhibit.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.840]   There's a white wall with his name, the Leo La Porte exhibition.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.400]   Yeah, if you're listening, you're missing it.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.240]   There's a picture of me.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.160]   This exhibition is a journey of visualization
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   and explores who I am.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.760]   Let's go around the corner and see.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.000]   It's in a virtual building.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.720]   Here's my friends.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.320]   It's in a virtual gallery.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:47.880]   These are actually--
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.520]   Just Cape Patello.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.960]   Just Cape Patello.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.920]   There's somebody looking at it with a ponytail, man.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.920]   These are people I actually know that I work with on the wall.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.840]   It is an art museum.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.960]   Oh, and there's children singing, and there's pictures.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.880]   There's my son.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.280]   Oh, I remember him.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.360]   There's my chin.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.680]   I love your chin.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.120]   Look at that.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.160]   Let's go around the corner.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.280]   Over here, you could see where I am
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.840]   and where I've been.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.240]   I'm in Petaluma.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.960]   You might find that a little creepy.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.880]   Here's all the words I've used.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.080]   Find was all happy birthday.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.760]   Brick, that's good.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.920]   Ham, Facebook security.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:29.840]   Amazing sale.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.920]   Twent!
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.520]   Twent, twent, twent, twent, twent, twent, twent, twent, twent.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.080]   But I have to say, there is something powerful,
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.560]   even though I know how they did this.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.840]   There's something kind of powerful
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.280]   about going to a museum that's all about you.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.480]   It is such brilliant marketing.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.480]   Yeah, if you're an eagle maniac.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.320]   That's it.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.640]   There's no better mark, magic.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.320]   Who is it?
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.240]   Narcissism.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.480]   These are all the videos that I've thumbsed up,
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.080]   that I've liked.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.560]   Apparently none.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.200]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.480]   There was a video there before.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.120]   Yeah, it looks like I got none, but--
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.720]   It's like a Mondrian test patterns.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.320]   But this is my favorite part.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.840]   Intel has created a special robotic unit
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.400]   that will take all of the pictures for my Facebook page
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.120]   and assemble them into a montage that reflects
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.880]   the most important things in my life.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:21.440]   The things I care most about, those little robot arms
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.600]   are just working so hard and just a moment we'll see.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.040]   Can I ask a question here?
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:27.840]   Yes.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.600]   Do these guys have anything better to do with their time
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.080]   than code this kind of crap?
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:32.520]   No.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:35.520]   And now look, this is what I care about most.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.800]   Me!
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.400]   Me!
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.600]   Thank you, Intel.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.000]   Thank you.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.040]   Oh, I love you.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.520]   That's Al Yankovich.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.280]   OK.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.440]   The thing I care about the most-- weird Al Yankovich.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.080]   How did it know?
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.920]   And these are all my friends in the universe
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.360]   of connections of people.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.520]   But have you noticed that Intel thinks of itself
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.520]   like a car company that they brand themselves just
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.760]   like car companies?
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.720]   And they're one of the only tech companies to do that.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.560]   Because what do you need to look at the chip and say,
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.840]   oh, I like the design of that.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:10.840]   But what am I supposed to do?
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.400]   So this is an ad for i5.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.880]   Am I supposed to feel quality?
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.560]   You're supposed to like Intel.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.440]   And now you're supposed to share it on Facebook.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.000]   But that's where this all came from.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.120]   This was sharing slower than this guy has my MacBook.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.040]   Right.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.840]   And that is phenomenal.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.600]   Like, that's kind of crazy.
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.720]   I think some people-- when I tweeted this--
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.720]   while a number of people said, wow, that's pretty amazing.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.960]   Because it really-- it's kind of a neat technology
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:37.560]   demonstration.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.200]   And it is, frankly, an ad that features me, which
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.440]   is-- you know, you got to love that.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.040]   And you and Intel are now connected.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.000]   And very much so.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.800]   I mean, it's actually, I think, very savvy.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.080]   However, a number of people felt this kind of creepy.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.000]   Is there a creepy factor to it?
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.440]   I didn't have to give them permission.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.800]   That's why I thought it was a Facebook ad because I
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:57.640]   had to give them Facebook.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.000]   So I knew you would.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.520]   Thank you.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.760]   Thank you very much.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.960]   You knew I would.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.720]   John C. Devouac.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.200]   I think it's sweet.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.640]   He thinks everything's creepy.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:12.840]   This guy is the anodyne to these sugar and sweetness
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.440]   that is--
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.520]   The Twit Broadcast.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.600]   The Twit Broadcast.
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:17.080]   We love John.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.360]   We love John C. Devouac.
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.240]   Go to channeldevouac.com to find out more.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.440]   And don't forget, no agenda needs your help.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.160]   Are you selling bricks yet, John?
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:25.560]   Because--
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.720]   No, we're not going to sell bricks
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.480]   because we're not derivative.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.880]   You're unique.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.280]   You got the brick concession all to yourself.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.320]   Look at that.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.560]   You could have a brick, John, right?
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.060]   You know what?
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.360]   I'm probably going to end up giving you a brick.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.560]   Because I hope so.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.480]   Yeah, because you deserve it.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:40.840]   You really--
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.200]   But you have two of the bricks that--
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.200]   No, this is what you get.
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.040]   So $120 you get this.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.040]   And that goes on our wall, right?
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.440]   And then you can order, for an additional fee,
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.040]   you can order a commemorative brick that
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.520]   goes to your home that you can use on your desk or whatever.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.640]   And if you want your logo, your business is logo,
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.880]   you could actually have that on the wall.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.920]   We have these 8x8s for an additional fee.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.640]   Including a logo.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.720]   Did I mention there was an additional fee for the logo?
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.600]   It's fascinating.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.680]   Hey, John, I'm just copying you.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.840]   You guys know how to monetize no agenda.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.120]   I've never seen anything like it.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.240]   It's brilliant.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.280]   It's brilliant.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.560]   Get some no agenda dice.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.960]   Are you selling dice now?
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.760]   Oh, we have a guy.
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.720]   No, people sell the dice.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.560]   We don't do it.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.520]   Oh, see, that's no fair.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.680]   Because I hope you get a cut.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.160]   No, we get a cut.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.320]   But we are open source.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.600]   So people can use our logo.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.160]   They can use whatever you want.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.800]   We don't lock stuff down.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.680]   And if they want to start a little business,
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:38.280]   selling no agenda dice and send us whatever they feel is
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.440]   a piece of the action.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.280]   They can do it.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.120]   They can do it.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.200]   And then we get the dice.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.880]   We got all kinds of weird, chotch-keys.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.200]   So you don't have advertisers.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.080]   You just have subscribers and producers.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:47.960]   No, producers.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.840]   You could be a night, $50 a month.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.160]   In 20 months, you could be a night.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.200]   Yeah, we have nights.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.200]   We have night rings.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.280]   They finally just came in from China.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.640]   Sounds like the Catholic Church.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:01.040]   What's going on with this?
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.000]   It's totally funny.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:02.560]   I love it.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.280]   I think it's brilliant.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.680]   And by the way, just you didn't invent that.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.360]   We've been creative comments since day one.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.440]   We're open source two.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.920]   You can reuse our stuff and all that.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:12.440]   I know, but nobody can take the Twitch.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.120]   They can't start selling Twitch memory or bealia, for example.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:15.600]   No, they can't.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600]   No, we've trademarked that.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.840]   In our case, they can.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.200]   So we're totally open source.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.240]   You're kind of, you cut it off.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.360]   Well, your commercial operation, your work,
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.720]   you got big advertising.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.560]   Why would you let people make no agenda t-shirts?
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.520]   Because we don't want to.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.280]   You're absolutely right.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.280]   See this?
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.080]   No money in it.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.960]   No money in it at all.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.520]   John's whole business model is so that he doesn't have to manage
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.760]   one other human being.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.280]   Exactly.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.640]   That way he has time to call us on weekday mornings and gossip.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.680]   He's got the right idea.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.600]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.880]   I'm just trying to do.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.080]   I'm a writer, and I guess apparently I knew him.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.280]   Mighty fine one.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.760]   Noagendocio.com, but channeldivorac.com is a place to go.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:01.960]   And don't forget to follow him at twitter.com/therealdivorac.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.160]   Yes, please.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.080]   I'm just short of 80,000.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   I don't understand why I can't break that little--
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.440]   You know, well, that's the timing you're on.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.640]   I thought we were going to put you over.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.480]   I'm stuck.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.440]   I'm stuck.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:16.880]   I think for everyone who follows you to drop you.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.840]   Or something.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   That's about right.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.160]   Because you were actually higher the last time you were,
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.480]   and I thought.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:24.760]   I just don't know.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.640]   A lot of it's spam.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.880]   They get a lot of spam followers.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.320]   That's what I think.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.720]   And then Twitter just kills them, and you drop.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.760]   Becky Worley is also B-Worley on Twitter.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.960]   Everybody should follow Ms. Worley.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.280]   I'm there for your following.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.680]   And are you on Good Morning America, like every few days?
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.280]   How often?
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.480]   I'm usually once a week.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.960]   I'll be on Tuesday.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:48.080]   I'll be at internet week talking to the folks for Yahoo.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.600]   What's internet week?
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.120]   What's internet week?
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:54.760]   It's kind of like a series of up fronts for internet providers.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.160]   You know, they talk to-- you know, up fronts for the TV folks
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.640]   is where they talk to the advertisers.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.400]   Right.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.040]   We do an upfront for Twitter.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.760]   But internet week is where you go.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:05.480]   It's in New York.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.320]   And the content providers and video providers,
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.640]   and Yahoo's making a big play.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.360]   And so being pretty-- I'm doing more stuff for them.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.400]   Oh, that's right.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.320]   You do stuff for Yahoo.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.800]   So this is not for Yahoo.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.360]   Oh, cool.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.080]   And a lot of other internet providers there.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.280]   So I'll be around.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.040]   And your website is Becky Worley.com.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.280]   Yeah, but find me on Facebook.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.200]   That's where I do all my most recent stuff and Twitter.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.800]   The Becky Worley and Be Worley on Twitter.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.040]   I'm the Leo LePort.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.840]   I took your advice.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.160]   Because somebody else had Becky Worley, right?
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.280]   Yeah, me.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:36.800]   Oh, I see.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.480]   You have a personal pages, Becky Worley.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:39.160]   Yes.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:39.720]   I get it.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:40.160]   You're smart.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.040]   That's what I did to you.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.680]   I'm Leo LePort on Facebook.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.800]   But I'm the Leo LePort is my public page.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.720]   Yeah, because that's the royal Leo LePort.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.240]   Yeah, we--
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.160]   When you put the V up there, you're suddenly
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.160]   in the third person.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.280]   I almost took Becky LePort.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.560]   There's a little frame slip.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.000]   Hey.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.480]   Hey now.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.000]   You know.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.280]   You know, baby.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:57.800]   I dream.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.280]   I want to drive the red sand.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.040]   I'm wearing the caffeinated pants.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:01.600]   Yes.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.000]   So let's have a check in.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.720]   I feel.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.640]   Just for the-- in case you've forgotten or joined us late,
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.480]   Leo was wearing caffeinated Spanx.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.000]   They also fit me, so they must be cool.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.080]   You've already worn these?
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.560]   Twice.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.240]   For how long?
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.080]   I thought they were a little clammy.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.560]   I thought that was the Shea butter.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.320]   I washed them.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.960]   The Shea butter and this caffeine stays in for 21 washes.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960]   Oh, that's bullsh--
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.960]   crummy white.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.840]   That's what the French people said.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.840]   Yeah, you can take the water from the washing machine
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.000]   and drink it.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.320]   You've already used up all the caffeine
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.320]   and shake butter in these.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.040]   No, 21 washes worth.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.160]   I just loosened it up.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.000]   What'd you do in these?
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.080]   Did you run?
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.840]   I made television that I worked out.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.520]   It's too late now.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.160]   Now it's getting a little creepy.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.760]   Wish you'd told me that.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.000]   Leo's wearing my caffeinated pants.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:53.480]   That's even--
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.480]   I'm wearing Becky's underwear right now.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.840]   But we're friends like that.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.520]   We are friends.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.920]   We've always been friends like that.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:02.760]   It's just--
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.920]   That doesn't greet me out.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.440]   No, because you're not wearing them.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:06.960]   True.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.960]   I don't want them back.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.800]   Would you like a bag?
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.120]   You can wear them now.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.480]   I want to thank everybody for joining us.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.080]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.640]   It's 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.440]   That would be 2,200 UTC if you are in the European area.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.680]   Our coverage of the World Wide Developers Conference
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.240]   begins tomorrow 9.45 a.m. Pacific time
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.880]   with Alex Lindsey, Aaron Hillagas, Tom Merritt.
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.920]   Stay tuned because Mac Break Weekly will follow that.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.080]   And then on Tuesday, of course, we're going to be live from E3.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:41.400]   I'll be down there with Brian Brushwood as last year.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.480]   And then our newest gaming contributor, who's an old friend,
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.360]   he started writing gaming columns for our local paper here
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:49.080]   when he was 14.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.960]   Glenn Rubenstein will be joining us.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.960]   He's the guy who told me about MP3's way back.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.040]   Yeah, really great guy.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:01.520]   So join us Tuesday for live coverage all day of the E3 gaming
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.080]   conference.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:02.760]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:03.640]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.600]   Don't forget to buy a brick.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.400]   And I'll see you next time.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:05.920]   Another twin.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:19.360]   In the meantime, I want to show you what I brought you.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.320]   All of us love our pets, but there is nothing fun about--
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.040]   I brought you these.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.240]   Or George Stephanopoulos.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.320]   Oh!
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.960]   Are these Spanx for boys?
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.720]   Those are caffeinated pants.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.040]   There's caffeine in them.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:32.920]   They're made in Italy.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.480]   They can't be--
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.680]   They're light tests caffeinated pants.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.800]   So there's caffeine and shea butter woven into the microfibers.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.920]   Well, I'm going to put these on.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:44.520]   I know.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:50.360]   And it releases into your skin to speed your metabolism.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.360]   Really?
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.480]   And unfortunately, these are medium and small.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.480]   They're going to be a little tight.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.360]   Let me go on the other one.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.240]   Yeah, I want to--
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.480]   I mean, I just--
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.160]   city?
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.680]   Now, they feel like--
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.480]   Come over by me.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.960]   Come over by me.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.160]   Hunter's moving very quickly.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.760]   So let's see if you stand right.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.320]   Where is that camera?
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.600]   I can't get in the shot.
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:14.560]   Oh, OK.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.040]   There we go.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:15.520]   There we go.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.280]   There it is.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.720]   Whoo, whoop, whoop, whoop.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:19.520]   It's your day.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.040]   So in my--
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:21.880]   How do you feel?
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.480]   Do you feel invigorated?
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.800]   I don't feel caffeinated.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.800]   Is this going to go through my skin?
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.320]   Mm-hmm.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.400]   So I think you should just wear them through the show.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.080]   All right.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:29.920]   And I think you're--
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.080]   They're kind of like skinny jeans.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.360]   They're like man skinny jeans, caffeinated pants.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.880]   And I just think that it might be kind of exciting for you
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.960]   during the show.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.840]   You're looking pretty fit down there, buddy.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.840]   I see that-- you see the hammies.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.680]   The hammies are there.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.640]   I've seen you naked.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   Come on.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.560]   I was there when you streak the internet tonight set.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.360]   This is Twit.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.960]   This week, I already did all that.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.800]   Hey, you got it.
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:57.440]   I gave you enough.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.200]   You have enough.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.240]   They added her to school just chopped the other stuff out.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.800]   There's a pro in Becky's pants.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:06.600]   What?
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.680]   Oh, Alex is editing this?
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:07.880]   All right.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:08.600]   Maybe I'll do it right.
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:09.260]   Sorry.
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.240]   It's my fault.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.680]   I--
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.760]   This?
