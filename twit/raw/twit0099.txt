[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.480]   We're perilously close to number 100, episode 99.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.880]   There's just a nice feel to that.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.440]   Episode 99 of this weekend tech.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.720]   And as is fitting as we approach the 100th show,
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.160]   we've got kind of a small group of the core panelists,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.240]   two of the original Twits.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.600]   Well, Patrick's the only original Twit.

[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.160]   Yeah, the epidemic's got nothing to do with the show.

[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.000]   That's a--
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.560]   Thank you, JohnSeedevorak.org/blog, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.640]   And Patrick Norton from Slamdance Industries.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.080]   And of course, DL.tv.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.680]   And welcome both of you guys.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.080]   We had--
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.520]   Doc was on the list, but had to bail at this last minute.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760]   So it's just the three of us.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.920]   But lots of stories to talk about.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.840]   Lots of good news.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.560]   Should we start with--
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.560]   I can't decide where to start here.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.920]   There's so many interesting stories.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920]   Did you get--
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.720]   I'm bringing up the delicious list.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.760]   Did you get the Chinese virus story?
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.200]   The virus of the self-- oh, the semantic story.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.400]   Yeah, that's what I mentioned.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.280]   Yeah, isn't that a great story?
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.360]   Isn't that nice of semantic?
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.200]   An update to semantics anti-virus signatures mistakenly
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.480]   quarantines two critical system files
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.640]   in the Chinese version of XP.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.760]   Oops.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.520]   So in the rough months, I mean, like--
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.880]   A few months ago, they finally come out
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.960]   of a decent version of the Norton tools.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.800]   And a month later, people are getting files deleted.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.200]   It's tough.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.400]   If you're Chinese and you use--
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.840]   according to Cisert, which is the Chinese internet security
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.240]   response team, if you use Norton anti-virus,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.000]   Norton internet security, or Norton 360,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.040]   and you updated on May 17, you couldn't reboot.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.520]   It deleted NetAPI32.dll and lsasrv.dll.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.200]   They thought they were a backdoor Trojan.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.920]   No, actually, kind of critical Windows files, apparently.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.360]   So apparently, the kicker to the story
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.560]   is that they also couldn't reinstall Windows
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   because it has all those crazy, you know,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.360]   protection, anti-piracy protection features,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.640]   and apparently something--
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.640]   Oops.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.520]   So you're basically been screwed by Microsoft and semantic.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.160]   According to the China Daily, the people that
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.000]   had this infection, and it's apparently in the millions,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.600]   are asking $13,000 per machine in damages.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.880]   Good.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.200]   Good.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.160]   Come on, money.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.240]   Well, let's maybe a little--
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.760]   Well, let's think about it.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.960]   You lose a machine.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.920]   It can't be rebooted.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.680]   You can't reinstall the operating system.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.000]   You can't use the thing.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.720]   $13 million?
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.240]   That is a little bit of money.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.080]   But it's pretty big.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.080]   That's a pretty big--
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.160]   It's 13 million plus three zeros.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.960]   It's a $13 billion deal if there's
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.000]   a million machines, in fact.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.800]   Wow.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.840]   That is a big deal.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.440]   A lot of numbers.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.800]   Speaking of-- oops.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.160]   We now know why Microsoft wasn't able to release Halo 2 on time.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.240]   It was supposed to come out, I think, now, right around now.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.440]   Won't be to the end of the month
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.640]   because there's some partial nudity in it.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.360]   And no one seems to know what the partial nudity is.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.080]   Why would there be any new--
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.920]   Halo 2?
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.420]   Come on.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.760]   What is partial nudity?
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.560]   I mean, if you go to the short sleeve shirt,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.400]   that's partial nudity.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.040]   I guess you're right.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.240]   It doesn't really say.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.040]   You're right.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.960]   One breast or a spot-oque.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.600]   What?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.960]   Well, what's interesting is Microsoft says,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.560]   it's not in the game.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.760]   No one who simply plays the game will ever
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.960]   find this obscure content error.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.200]   That's the other Microsoft.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.600]   I like that.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.920]   I have no problem.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.840]   It's a OCE, obscure content error.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.280]   Nothing to worry about.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.880]   Apparently, some did leak out, so we
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.280]   may be able to see the partial nudity.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.840]   Well, apparently, it's not actually in the game.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.280]   So somebody's got to dig through it.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.160]   That seems confusing.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.600]   Well, neither was the stuff in the hot coffee mod, remember.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.520]   And that caused a lot of problems for Grand Theft Auto.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.520]   Because it unlocked scenes that were buried in the code,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.200]   scenes you wouldn't normally see.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.160]   Wait, I found it.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.560]   I found it.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.880]   You found a picture?
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.280]   It said not a picture, but game daily business.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.400]   Game daily business, the content in question,
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.680]   although likely to be inaccessible to the vast majority
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.080]   of users displays a photograph of an individual showing
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.120]   his bare butt-tocks.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.400]   It is butt-tocks.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.640]   Two users are wearing a particular error occurs,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.960]   and thus warrants a partial nudity content descriptor
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.320]   in order to alert customers to its present in the product.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.240]   How pathetic are we?
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   So yeah, basically.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.840]   So a video game character in a peculiar error
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.920]   moons the user.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   Is that maybe an error message?
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.840]   That would be kind of funny, actually.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.480]   Well, you blew it.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.920]   Microsoft is getting fresh again.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.880]   French have bare-breasted women on their money,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.480]   but if we have a buttock, inaccessible in a video game,
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.600]   we've got to pull it off the market.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.200]   People are very--
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.440]   If we have a video game character buttock.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.760]   It's not even a real buttock.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.640]   Oh, it's just a cartoon buttock.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.480]   It's an aneoliest buttock.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.280]   And master chief's buttock.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.880]   That's not really even a buttock.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.280]   It's just a drawing.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.320]   It's a drawing of a--
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.080]   Master Chief has some fine man-gluteal muscles.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.320]   Not that I'm looking.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.280]   That's an overshare.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.760]   That I'm checking in on any other--
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.320]   Not a share.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.960]   But no, people wear master chief costumes.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.320]   He's a character that people love.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.960]   Speaking of which--
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.840]   a Michigan man--
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.920]   I don't know how I'm going to get the segue to this.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.760]   But a Michigan man is--
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.600]   You already blew it.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.000]   I just-- there's no segue to this.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.280]   You go in and say, there's no segue.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.960]   There's no segue.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.840]   You say, hey, wait, hold on.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.040]   Say, I got a joke to tell you stuff.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.840]   Funniest joke you've ever heard.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.280]   Oh, wait.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.000]   Although I can't tell it very well.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.280]   How about this?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.240]   How about this?
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.040]   Speaking of men's buttocks, a Michigan man
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.520]   spent a lot of time sitting outside a cafe using their free Wi-Fi.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.280]   That was the segue.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.000]   That worked.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.800]   That was very good.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.640]   Speaking of buttocks, this guy--
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.720]   he's checking his email or whatever.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.440]   I guess he showed up a lot, though.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.320]   The coffee people didn't complain.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.680]   But a police officer noticed the guy sitting in front
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.440]   of the cafe day after day.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.960]   He questioned him.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.520]   And the guy didn't know that there was anything wrong with it.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.840]   So he said, I knew that the cafe had Wi-Fi.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.880]   I was just going down and checking my email.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.120]   He was arrested.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.720]   Why?
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.600]   Under Michigan's fraudulent access to computers,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.120]   computer systems, and computer networks law
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.040]   could result in a five-year felony and a $10,000 fine.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.400]   Why?
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.760]   It's against the law.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.440]   I thought it was a cafe of Wi-Fi.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.040]   The cafe owner said, I didn't even
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.000]   know he was doing anything.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.280]   I don't know.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.440]   It was a crime.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   Police officer says, I had a feeling
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.720]   a lot was being broken, but I didn't know what.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.880]   Oh, this cop's a jerk.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   This is-- remember, we talked about this a couple of years
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.560]   ago.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.600]   Talk about it all the time.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.520]   And it's just ridiculous that this even comes up
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.200]   in the conversation.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.840]   This should be a dead letter law.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.440]   These idiots that are actually trying to enforce this.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.800]   What's the point?
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.280]   Hey, good job of stopping crime, Mr. policeman.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.480]   Hey, by the way, that old lady is being moved around.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   According, you don't want to deal with that guy, do you?
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.200]   No, no.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.920]   A person in Wi-Fi and an act of piracy
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.400]   will be a death penalty.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.040]   According to section 752.795 of the Michigan Penal Code--
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.600]   The guy must have been a metermaid.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.640]   Section 5 says, a person shall not, intentionally
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.160]   and without authorization, or by exceeding valid authorization,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.960]   do any of the following.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.200]   Now, it doesn't seem to me that he's--
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.120]   How did this law even get on the books?
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.800]   I mean, they've got an open Wi-Fi.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.200]   So people who are hacking Wi-Fi can be gone.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.280]   They have legal means to go after something.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.400]   Yeah, but he's not hacking.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   That's legitimate use of the law.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.600]   If you can track down somebody that's
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.440]   breaking into your--
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.940]   Right.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.920]   --obviously not so secure--
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.800]   I don't think there's even anything.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.560]   Listen, it says access or cause access
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.160]   to be made to a computer program, computer system,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.960]   or network to acquire altered damage,
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.520]   deleted, destroyed property, or otherwise use
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.080]   the service of that network.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.200]   Use.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.960]   Insert or attach or knowingly create
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.480]   the opportunity for unknowing and wanted
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.560]   insertion of attachment of a set of instructions.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.060]   You're right.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.720]   This is all about hacking.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.000]   Yeah, but it says it's got the word in its use.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.360]   It's got to be written.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.480]   Yeah, it's very badly written.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.800]   It's ridiculous.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.640]   Besides that, it wasn't-- what was it hurting?
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.400]   Well, nobody, unless the guy-- it would be nice to--
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.960]   Why is it a felony with five years in jail?
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.400]   Unbelievable.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.800]   I mean, what kind of country are we running here?
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.280]   According to the prosecutors, they're
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.920]   going to go easy on the guy, a $400 fine
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.160]   and 40 hours of community service.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.120]   That's not easy.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.640]   That's awful.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.920]   Going easy on the guy is a 10-but-fine and get out of here.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.520]   40 hours of community service, it'll be good for him.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.120]   It'll be a felony on his record.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.040]   No, no, they're not going to put it on his record.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.720]   But I think the britve's a redip cert.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.400]   I mean, there's nothing more to say.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.160]   What a ridiculous law.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.880]   Did you see-- Patrick, you must have seen this.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.080]   I'm sure you probably even did something on DLTV.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.880]   The new tiny bendable Sony display, 2 and 1/2 inch display.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.360]   I saw that.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:14.840]   It's pretty cool.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.480]   Is it OLED?
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.120]   Yeah, it's the only thing--
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.680]   They can't-- they have the stuff.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.920]   It's impossible.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.680]   All this is going to be OLED.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.160]   Go ahead, Patrick.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.960]   Oh, so yeah.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.240]   It's like a 2 and 1/2 inch screen.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.080]   They show it flexing.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.840]   It's very exciting.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840]   What would you do with the--
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.040]   I mean, yeah, that means you could put in your wallet
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.680]   and sit on it.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.440]   I don't understand.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   You can put around it.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:35.940]   You know what?
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.960]   Where this is all headed?
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.840]   This is all headed.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.120]   This will be a nightmare for the generation that comes after us.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.040]   This is all headed to the grocery store.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.040]   I'm packaging.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.480]   Seriously, think about it.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.960]   You're going to have everything with like every Biscuit box
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.520]   is going to have a little jumping guy jumping up and down.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.760]   Buy me, buy me.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.160]   You know, it's going to be unbelievable.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.000]   It's going to be a nightmare to go shopping,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.880]   especially if you're like an epileptic
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.680]   or you've got a little vertigo and you're going to get dizzy in there.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.840]   Or you just get annoyed when an admin objects talk to you.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.520]   Advertisements everywhere.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.160]   Between that and the federally mandated RFID chips
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.240]   for human tracking, it's going to be a real nightmare.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.800]   Well, no, the good news is the ads will all
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.960]   be programmed to your personal interests.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.320]   That's exactly what I'm afraid of.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.160]   Yeah, because you'll have the RFID chip.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   And as soon as you-- this is a good one,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.880]   I can use this in my speech, by the way.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.760]   You walk into the store, it identifies you,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.720]   and it changes all the ads dynamically on all the packages.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.160]   It's a special Devorac advertising.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160]   Yeah, you walk in and the Biscuit has got, you know,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.920]   maybe my picture on there saying, hey, John, look at me.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.880]   You can have a good time.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.840]   Am I having your picture?
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.720]   Whoa.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.840]   You're right.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.960]   Now, let's think about this.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.800]   If you're going to customize advertising,
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.760]   don't just say, OK, instead of advertising,
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.520]   Biscuit to this guy will advertise custom yachts.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.120]   But put him in it.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.480]   Put your picture in it.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.080]   Right.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.640]   Hi, John.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.960]   This is John.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.560]   It's straight out of that Schwanzenanger film.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.800]   You must go to Moz.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.880]   Thought I was the minority report when Tom Cruise ducks
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.920]   down the hallway, and it optically scans his retina,
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.640]   and then all of a sudden it's just all advertising targeted
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:11.920]   at him.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.640]   It's one of those horrifying things that were written.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.600]   Yeah, the movie about pre-crime.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.440]   What was the name of that thing?
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:15.920]   It was a good film.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.640]   An minority report.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.720]   An minority report.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.160]   Philip K. Dick said this was going to happen years ago.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.480]   He's known it for years.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.280]   He played runner.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.080]   Remember in Blade Runner, it adds on every surface.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.640]   We're headed that way.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.080]   At least they're out in Blade Runner.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.480]   I don't know.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.400]   It's going to be a routine.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   You know, they have no idea what products are going to use
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:33.720]   this on.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.040]   They don't know when they're going to release it.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.560]   I think John's got a good idea, though,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.080]   put it on boxes on packaging.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.440]   Put it on a box, put it on Biscuit.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.600]   And I like to follow up by having your own picture.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.400]   You probably want to buy the thing just as a cool picture.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.600]   You are on it.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   Ooh.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.680]   Yes, show you making the Biscuit.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.200]   Look.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.040]   You're going to be making biscuits until it gets home.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.640]   And then it's going to program itself
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.520]   with a series of other annoying assets.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.280]   Or what about this?
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.600]   It's your mother's picture.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.680]   Biscuits?
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.840]   No, it's not even--
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.920]   Patrick, you should buy this.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.400]   Honey, whatever horrible kind of coffee Biscuit goes.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.520]   Well, here's the twist of the whole thing.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.240]   A hacker gets involved.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.440]   And programs, the whole started display nothing but porn.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   Goatee.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.000]   Everywhere you look, that will happen.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.360]   That happened to us.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.520]   Remember we were at the Apple Store
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.520]   and some guy put Goatee on the--
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   You want to explain the listeners out there?
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.360]   I don't want to explain.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.680]   They don't know what Goatee is.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.680]   No, you can explain in vague details.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.000]   It is a hideously grotesque pornographic image
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.840]   that has become an internet meme.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.200]   All in the-- all in the-- all in the--
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.240]   all in the-- itself.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   Yeah, well, here's the--
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.720]   Then if you see it, you'll regret it
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   because it will never go out of your mind.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.640]   I'll explain what it--
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   Not.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.560]   The thing is, is there's a lot of people that--
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.280]   You know, this image, this Goatee image,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.000]   is used occasionally by bloggers or website guys
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   who don't like the fact that somebody deep-linked
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.960]   to one of their images.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.440]   This is the big problem you have if you're a blogger
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.240]   and you're deep-linking to other people's images,
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.560]   which a lot of people do.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.480]   And Huffington even does it.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.320]   And it's legal.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.040]   But you always risk somebody swapping out the image
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.800]   for Goatee.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.280]   And then your blog will have it
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.680]   and you will lose-- you will not be happy.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.320]   That's why a only deep link to Amazon.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:20.840]   Really?
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.640]   No, my space.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.640]   Somebody was pirating a bunch of her images
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.080]   and she got upset about it so she substituted something.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.800]   But don't you-- but doesn't that put Goatee on your site
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.560]   as well?
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.200]   Not if you change the name of the photos that are linked
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.640]   on your website.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640]   Love it.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.840]   That's how you do it.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.040]   You're using science.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.160]   Nissan used science to its detriment.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.680]   And apparently, the automaker is telling North American customers,
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.120]   don't put your keys near your cell phones.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.040]   Cell phones that go next to Nissan's intelligent I keys
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.480]   may erase the electronic code rendering them unable to unlock
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.920]   or start the car.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.440]   I hate it when that happens.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.960]   If you've got a 2007 Nissan Altima or Infinity G35--
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.800]   these are big sellers--
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.160]   don't touch them to your cell phone.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.840]   So don't put them in your purse with your phone.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.640]   Do we have any documentation that this story is true?
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.960]   It's from-- I never heard of this magazine.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.800]   PC Magazine?
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   Mm.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.040]   Well, I must just-- let me just reiterate then.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.800]   Do we have any documentation that this--
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.300]   Whoa.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.320]   It's via a wire.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.840]   Hey, we've run all kinds of stuff.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.800]   It's probably from a wire.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.240]   It is.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.960]   It's via a wire.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.000]   We've run your columns, John.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.960]   Well, hey, I'm not going to stop saying it then.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.160]   Do we have any proof that this is true?
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.360]   No, I mean, it would have to be a completely falsified article.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.680]   I think we need to test it.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.160]   They quote a Nissan spokesman, Kyle Baysmore.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.000]   The car won't start, and the I key cannot be reprogrammed.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.640]   Oh, well, if a guy from Nissan says it, then it probably is true.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.280]   Yeah, there's many of you.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.640]   So what kind of bonehead key is this?
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.840]   Do you don't have one of these keys?
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.280]   You know what's really bad about these?
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:57.800]   I have one.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.440]   I don't like these keys.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:58.920]   You have one.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.360]   Your Lexus has one.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.120]   I turn it off.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.880]   You know what happened?
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.160]   Let me give you the backstory on that.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160]   I had one of these keys with a button.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.720]   I don't have the button that I don't have the key that--
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.080]   But there's a chip walking into the car and it starts.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.400]   No, no, but there's a chip in the key.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.520]   Your car will not start.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.160]   You could duplicate the metal of the key.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.680]   My car predates that.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.520]   I don't like that stuff.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.480]   You should.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.280]   I'll tell you a good reason not to.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.240]   Insurance companies then assume your car is unsteelable,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.560]   which it isn't, but should it get stolen,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.200]   it becomes very hard to recover.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.480]   Because the insurance companies say, no, this is fraud.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.800]   You have an unsteelable car.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.920]   There are documented cases where people have tried
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.880]   to file an insurance claim with a car with this kind
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.080]   of interlock.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.280]   And the insurance company says, no,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   you couldn't have been stolen.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.040]   That's unsteelable.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.720]   You're true defrauding us.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.560]   You're kidding.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.040]   I'd also point out, John, that the announcement actually
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.600]   came from Nissan North America.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.680]   Quote, "We discovered that if the IKEE touches a cell phone
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   outgoing or incoming calls have the potential
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.400]   to alter the electronic code inside the IKEE."
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:16:59.920]   Oops.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.880]   That is from Nissan spokesman Kyle Bay's car.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.360]   Oops, see.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.200]   The car won't start and the IKEE cannot be programmed.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.720]   This problem has occurred in a quote,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.480]   very small percentage of cars sold.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.120]   Yeah, well, you just hope it's not your car.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.440]   You know, I don't even use the feature that I
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.600]   sound like an old foggy here, but I don't even
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.920]   use the feature where the button feature on the Lexus
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.320]   older models, I guess, older Newers.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.880]   You mean to open and unlock the car?
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.720]   Well, you push the button, it opens and unlocks it.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.960]   How do you not use that?
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.160]   Well, because a few years ago, somebody
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160]   came out with a universal unlocker.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.680]   Ooh.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   You know, a little handheld device.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.960]   How do you defeat that?
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.160]   There's a little switch underneath the steering wheel.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.600]   You flip it and it turns it off.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.520]   Oh, I should do that.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.640]   And what happened was a friend of mine
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.080]   who had the exact same car as mine,
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.160]   she told me that her Lexus was stolen.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.600]   Right.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.200]   And that's how they stole it with one
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   of these universal unlocking boxes.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.160]   And I flipped the thing off and I never turned it back on.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.440]   And I remember a couple of years--
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.760]   probably it was almost 10 years ago-- when some guy had invented
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.280]   this universal device that you push it and just sends out
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.520]   a huge bunch of frequencies and it just
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.560]   unlocks all the cars in the parking lot.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.600]   And he wanted to sell the thing.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.800]   It was either online or in some magazine or something.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.280]   It was a big scandal because nobody would take the ads
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.080]   and it was like--
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.880]   it was controversial at the time.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.680]   And I still remember that product.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.520]   And as far as I'm concerned, forget it.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.920]   I don't need to-- what do I need?
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.280]   I can use a key.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.120]   I can find the keyhole.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.480]   I wish I had a crank in the front of my car.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.120]   You can't steal those.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.160]   Do you have a crank on your truck?
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.440]   Patrick?
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   No, but my--
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.640]   No, but the crank drive is one.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.640]   Yes.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.120]   Well, actually my old landcruiser, the front of the old--
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.640]   you know, the landcruisers at the top tops, 40, 50, 55.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.880]   But big old 4,000 pound six cylinder engine actually
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.720]   was designed to be hand-cranked.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   Really?
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:56.880]   I remember this--
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.080]   There's a hole in the front of that truck.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   You got to be careful.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.840]   Break your arm right off.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.320]   Oh, this is just true.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.800]   Yeah, you got to put your thumb in the right.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   I can remember it.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.520]   Break your arm right off.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.760]   Oh, are we old?
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.120]   No, not--
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.440]   He kicks back.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.520]   I remember also being told that I used to have a motorcycle.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.840]   And there's the old Harley's you had to kickstart him.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   You know, and of course, nobody kicks starts anything anymore.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.160]   People don't kickstart bikes anymore?
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   That's not true.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.440]   A lot of people build choppers with kickstart.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.160]   Just for that.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.520]   Well, anyway, you had to be careful.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.360]   There's nothing cooler than that.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.480]   People are just supposed to be the kickstart and throw you right
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.640]   over the bike.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.160]   The bike isn't bad.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.920]   There's a lot of old spinted sportster riders
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.280]   that actually have this strange bump halfway up their shin.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.080]   Oh, yeah?
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.040]   It doesn't kickstart.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.640]   And the compression kicks.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.240]   The kickstart are backing you.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.800]   Break your leg.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.560]   Right off.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.400]   I don't know about off, but it hurts.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:49.760]   I'm going to--
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.800]   I'm sure it hurts.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.480]   I've got to come back on Cranky Geeks
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.080]   and show you the new Nokia.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.440]   I replaced that one that looked like a camcorder with the Nokia
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.040]   N95, which is better and smaller.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.960]   You just get everything that comes out.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.280]   Yes.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.520]   I have a very bad habit.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.440]   I need help.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.000]   That was why I got in this business.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Can you give me the old one?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.720]   No, actually, the old one was a loner,
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.520]   which I'm sitting back, but I did buy the new N95.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.280]   Sorry, I would.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.240]   You know what?
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.560]   All you have to do is start a Vox blog.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.440]   They'll loan you one.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.400]   What's Vox got to do with it?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.040]   Well, because Vox has a deal with Nokia, that's how they--
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.720]   they let me on their phone because they want to--
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.840]   I don't know anyway.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.120]   But actually, the reason I bring this up is apparently
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.280]   Qualcomm has been suing Nokia over CDMA and GSM patents
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.160]   that Nokia licensed in the past.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.680]   Apparently does not anymore.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.000]   In fact, Nokia's counterclaiming that some of the technology
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.360]   Qualcomm's using belongs to Nokia.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.760]   If Qualcomm has filed 11 different patent infringement
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.600]   lawsuits against Nokia in the last two years,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.400]   the most recent suit, says that Nokia's GSM's
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.920]   GPRS edge cellular phones infringed on two patents
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.960]   covering the uses of speech encoders.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.480]   They're asking that a judge enjoying
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.800]   Nokia to stop selling phones in the US.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.680]   Yeah, like that's going to happen.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.400]   I've seen stronger injunctions.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.600]   I want my phone.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.960]   I'm going to keep my phone.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.240]   They can't have it.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.600]   I like it.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.120]   I use disposables.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.120]   I know.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.160]   You and the cocaine that cartels.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.000]   Hey.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.680]   Hey, if it worked--
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   -- throw them in the garbage window.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.040]   If it worked for Manuel Noriega, it works for Devorak.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.880]   I don't know how well it worked for Manuel.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.360]   I wish we-- yeah, you're right.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.440]   He ended up having him sit and listen to kiss music
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.760]   played on loud speakers for 20, 20, 20, 20 days.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.680]   Like Linda Ron's death.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.800]   Oh, wasn't good music?
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.760]   Oh.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.240]   Well, what you're--
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.520]   --minds me, there's a good story about Manuel Noriega in the--
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.400]   Really?
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.080]   --book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, which
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.760]   is on that site that you mentioned, Leo, that you
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.920]   have some connection with.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.000]   We know they didn't buy advertising on this show,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.040]   so don't--
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.320]   They don't buy advertising anymore?
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.720]   They bought one ad.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.640]   Oh.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.200]   OK, well, we'll--
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:01.840]   Thank you, though.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.880]   It was very kind of you.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.200]   Well, we won't give them a plug, then.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.080]   No.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.080]   They got great response.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.160]   At last I heard they had 400 new users because of it.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.320]   And I think they're coming back.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.760]   But as a result of them only buying one ad, I cannot plug.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.040]   But tell me the book.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.680]   We'll say it's audible.com/twip.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.720]   But what's the book?
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.080]   We get Confessions of an Economic--
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.320]   because I want to get this.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.560]   Audible.com.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.120]   Yeah, you definitely want to get this.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.880]   This will depress you to no end.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.840]   This is the one where the world is coming to an end in 1999.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.880]   No, this is Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.960]   I wouldn't say it's an alternative view of reality,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.640]   but it may be the actual view of reality
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.160]   from at least one or two financial perspectives.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.440]   And who is the guy?
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.080]   I can't remember his name.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.240]   He's gone off to become a kind of a crackpot.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.400]   I think he's kind of a George Gilder-type.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.920]   No, he was a legitimate--
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.320]   John Perkins.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:54.960]   Yeah, that guy.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.080]   He was legitimate now.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.840]   But now he's gone into the Ecuador.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.920]   He's gone back to his roots.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.360]   He used to be a start-off in the Peace Corps.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.840]   And I think he's lost some credibility
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.760]   because he now writes crazy books.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.160]   But I think it's because they've drug them.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.200]   This is the inside story.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.640]   Is this the speaking of Manuel Noriega part?
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.040]   Suddenly the show took a turn.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.040]   It's not libel.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.120]   This is the inside story of how America turned
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.720]   from a respected republic into a feared empire.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.880]   Well, oh gosh, that's not so good.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.920]   Economic hitman, John Perkins writes,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.240]   are highly paid professionals who cheat countries
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.280]   around the globe out of trillions of dollars.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.600]   Their tools include fraudulent financial reports,
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.640]   rigged elections, pay off extortion, sex and murder.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.320]   He was one, apparently.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   Yes, well, he was one--
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.400]   In Panama.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.480]   On one of the layers, he wasn't one of the guys
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.880]   who killed people.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.920]   Wow, this sounds interesting.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.960]   Well, that's a great book.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.480]   I mean, it's one of the best reads you'll ever have.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.800]   Or listens.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.000]   Think of it as fiction.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.720]   In other words.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.000]   Yeah, that's the ticket.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.360]   This is a reasonable book.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.520]   It's the later books that are more sort of fantastic
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.760]   as what you're saying, John.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.040]   Let me see if Audible has other of John--
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.400]   No, they only have that one.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.560]   No, that's his bestseller.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.400]   That thing was bestseller for about a year.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.680]   I think he came out in 2004.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.560]   Do we care that Facebook has finally opened up its service
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.880]   to third party developers?
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.680]   They have an API?
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   Something like that.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.360]   I think it's smart, actually.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.600]   Well, my space has done it for a while, haven't they?
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.000]   Actually, now they're starting to close down.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.120]   They want to limit the number of people
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.080]   who can mess around, the photo buckets of the world.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.040]   I think you guys are missing the point here.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.720]   What's the point?
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   The point is that-- what's his name?
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.800]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.160]   Mark Zuckerberg, yeah?
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.920]   Zuckerberg.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.440]   The guy who turned down Yahoo's billion dollars.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.400]   Yeah, well, I can't say much for that idea.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.160]   But anyway, so he made mention that he
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.120]   wants to turn Facebook into an operating system.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.360]   Oh, of course.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.920]   Where you can run applications.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   Now, what's the last company that made this kind of a assertion?
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   And what happened to them?
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.560]   Isn't it, son?
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.120]   Google.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.120]   They've got more and more and more.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:00.640]   Netscape.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.200]   Netscape.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   So a few people have wrecked on these shoals.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.000]   Yeah, because Microsoft will go after you.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.880]   So you could use Windows, OS 10, or Facebook.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.560]   That would be your choice.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.920]   I don't know if I want to use the Facebook operating system.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.400]   I wonder what they're going to call the operations.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.000]   No, how about--
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.600]   It's a theory of API.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   F-52.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.040]   Now that he says operations, I think
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.920]   they should call the operating system facial.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.160]   Facial's good.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:29.840]   It's a good name.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840]   I'd like a facial, please.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.680]   I'd call the operating system.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.760]   But this isn't that much different from what Google's
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.080]   done on opening its API.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.200]   So is this beyond what my space does?
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.160]   Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   No.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.000]   I mean, Zuckerberg, he's young.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.680]   He's smart.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.520]   He's focused.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.920]   He has a really good vision.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.640]   And he's got a huge number of partners working on this one.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.240]   You know, you almost have to be.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.720]   If you turn down a billion dollars,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.360]   you almost have to now put up or shut up.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.160]   You have to say, well, this is why I've
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.840]   got something even more valuable.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.680]   65 new services, including photo slideshows from Slide.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.600]   A music recommendation service I like.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.480]   That's available on iTunes right now.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.880]   A music player, Uber, Uber.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.040]   Uber is not a good name for a music player.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.720]   A new video application will allow Facebook users
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.920]   to send video messages.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.680]   This is the way the web's moving, though.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.120]   In fact, that's one of the kind of fun things about my space.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.840]   You could have bet all this crap on there.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.600]   Only a goober use Uber.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.480]   Goober, be a goober, use an Uber.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.120]   It is not a good name for a music player.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.880]   Hey, by the way, I forgot to say happy towel day.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.880]   Did you know this is towel day, Patrick?
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.920]   Do you remember wearing towels on the screen savers
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.240]   in honor of Douglas Adams?
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.560]   A very long time ago.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.280]   We missed you, Douglas.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.040]   2001, this started, but I think it's kind of--
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.400]   I mean, if you look on Wikipedia, it's still going on.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.320]   Douglas Adams passed away May 11th.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.760]   Is it 2001?
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.480]   I think it was.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.640]   You were one of the last people to interview him, weren't you, John?
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.480]   Yeah, I am on my show.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.720]   He was-- I knew Doug for a long time,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.600]   because he and I kind of ran into each other a lot on various Mac
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   user events.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.360]   He was a big Macintosh user.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.080]   Great guy.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.720]   And he was a good speaker too.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.920]   Yeah, he was a really great guy.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.120]   He's had a good sense of humor, very dry, big guy.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.120]   Kind of a big larger-than-life character.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.400]   We're talking-- in case you don't know,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.880]   we're talking about the author of the Hitchhiker's Guide
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.560]   to the Galaxy.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.320]   And the towel, of course, is what all good hitchhiker's carry
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.560]   when they hitchhike from star to star.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.440]   And that's why towel day is such an important day to remember.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.640]   Just a really way of remembering Douglas Adams.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.560]   But he interviewed him, I think, just a month or two
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.640]   before he passed on.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.040]   It wasn't too long.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.760]   Yeah, I know.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.000]   It was kind of weird.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.760]   Yeah, it was very sad.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.880]   Very disappointing.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.760]   Yeah, because he wasn't very old.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.160]   He was a young guy.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.160]   Also, another important anniversary-- this
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.280]   is the 30th anniversary of the release of.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.040]   Anybody want to say?
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.400]   Do you know?
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.040]   Windows.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.160]   No?
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:00.880]   1977.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.720]   Macintosh.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.680]   1977.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.520]   PC, Apple II.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.960]   Star Wars.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.120]   No, no.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.280]   I'm thinking computers.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.120]   Yeah, wow.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:10.360]   We're thinking movies.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.760]   We're thinking geeks.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.720]   There's a lot of stuff that happened in 1977.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.920]   It was a good year.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.080]   I was the year I would have graduated from college
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.600]   had I actually applied myself.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   You didn't graduate?
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.120]   No.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:22.760]   I thought you did.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.120]   I got in the radio.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.480]   In philosophy or something.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.240]   Some--
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.320]   Chinese studies.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.000]   That's probably why I didn't graduate.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.680]   In fact, I'm going to my 33 Union next week.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.840]   We won't have a Twit next week because I will be in New Haven.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.600]   I thought next week we're doing the 100th.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.280]   Yeah, we're not.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.920]   We're going to do it a week from Friday.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.160]   We're going to go OK.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.320]   Two weeks from today.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.120]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.080]   Normally, next week would be the 100th since this is the 99th.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.000]   But I have to take next week off.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.880]   I'm going to be in New Haven.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.120]   You know who is in my class besides Stone Phillips?
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.080]   The Dateline?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.440]   Stone Phillips was in my class.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.200]   Yeah, he was the star quarterback jock guy.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.640]   He was a quarterback jock?
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.960]   He played for-- I don't know if he was a quarterback.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.680]   He played for the Yale football team.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.440]   I think, yeah.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.720]   Oh, the Yale football team.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.200]   Well, yeah, right.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.240]   But--
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   Go deep.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:08.960]   Go deep.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.280]   Go deep.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.120]   I see you.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.880]   No, they were a good football team.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.720]   Harvard Yale game.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.080]   That was the game.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.800]   Oh, I bet it was.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.720]   Stanford and Cal have the big game.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.920]   But Harvard Yale is the game.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.680]   You hear my dog whining?
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.880]   I think he wants to go out.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.560]   OK, let's make the announcement to the folks out there.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.200]   You have a new member of the family.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.680]   I do.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.640]   A Papillon dog.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.480]   An epileptic Papillon.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.640]   Well, maybe.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.800]   We don't know what was--
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.040]   he was actually in a really bad shape.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.280]   We thought he was going to die.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.840]   And he was in the hospital for a couple of nights.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.800]   You know, it's a great thing to get a new puppy
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.920]   and spend a couple of grand on hospital bills
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.600]   like right out of the shoot.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.080]   I hear there's insurance for that.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   But I guess it's too late now.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.880]   I never heard about that insurance for that.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.480]   It was worth it.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.200]   He's a very sweet.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.440]   Papillon is a little French dog with big ears.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.880]   I don't call him French dog, but I call him a Liberty dog.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.600]   Exactly.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.000]   Yeah, he's a Liberty dog.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.880]   So anyway, Star Wars 30 years ago.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.320]   Do you remember your first time?
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.360]   I went to the premiere.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360]   Did you?
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.440]   San Francisco premiere, which had a lot of the people there.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.280]   Because Lucas is local.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.800]   I'm here.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.960]   Yeah, I was at the Coronet.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.160]   He was packed with celebrities.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.680]   Now I'm looking at the 1987--
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.240]   I had some invite of some sort.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.400]   Were you in the tech?
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.920]   You weren't tech writer then, were you?
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.960]   I was kind of.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.760]   But I think I had my software company.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.680]   Then all I know is I had some sort of a special invite
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.920]   from someone to go to this thing.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.720]   I'm looking at the old 1987 computer
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.600]   chronicles with you.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.280]   That is a hoot.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.600]   Must have looked like a real jerk off.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.080]   Did you put that on the work.org/blog?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.400]   Or are you too vain to actually show people that?
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.520]   It is so vain.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.360]   I'm not vain.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:54.960]   I know you're not vain.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.880]   I'm practical.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   You're not vain.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.440]   It's a very-- those glasses, those are big--
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.280]   Those big old giant glasses from the last--
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.280]   Big ass glass.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.600]   And I'm not going to mock you because I wore the same big ass
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.440]   glasses.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.040]   I mean, we all did.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.400]   It's a Patrick who was like 12.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.480]   That was the glass of the day.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.800]   I mean, that was the glass as you wore.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.080]   Otherwise, you look like a Lenin.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.320]   That's right.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.280]   It's true.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.640]   Now, because in the '60s, you did
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.040]   wear the little wire frames.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.600]   And then in the '70s and '80s, it became those--
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600]   Big giant things.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.800]   Big computer glasses, yeah.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.920]   Anyway, I'll put a link in the show notes to the--
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.680]   John's appearance.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.760]   You're demonstrating PS2 computers on that.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.560]   Oh, that's the one with David Benel?
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.680]   That's a classic because it was driving these guys crazy
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.760]   because immediately we started to--
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.520]   I think Gary--
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:43.960]   It was me.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.320]   I was taking the thing apart with--
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.080]   you know, so I think what happens when you pull this?
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.720]   Yeah, I basically took the whole thing apart
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.320]   right in front of these guys.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.600]   And they were like freaked out like I was going to wreck it.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.920]   But the weird thing about that PS2 model--
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.320]   and I remember it to this day--
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.400]   is it was actually you'd snap a bunch of things
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.000]   and the thing would fall into a bunch of pieces.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.680]   It was great.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.440]   You're supposed to be able to.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.440]   Yeah, I was supposed to.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.960]   You're supposed to fall apart.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.600]   And it snapped right back.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.160]   It's a great video.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.920]   And it just cracked me up.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.160]   It was circulating in the net.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.320]   This was a hot item, a viral video on the net.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.920]   What do people get to find these things?
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.400]   I don't know.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.360]   And then they uploaded.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.680]   And I looked like-- besides Shafay,
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.000]   I think Gary Killdahl was on that show too.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.920]   Good be.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.440]   I think he was a co-host for a while.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.480]   Yeah, he was for a while.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.040]   Digital Reaser--
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.920]   Yeah, for a very short time.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.080]   I wrote DR Doss.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.440]   And it got kind of robbed.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.240]   Anyway, 30th anniversary Star Wars.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.400]   Do you remember Patrick the first time?
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.320]   How old were you in '77?
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.400]   I was seven, and I saw it at the Menlo Park Mall
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.520]   with my parents.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:46.880]   Aw.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.600]   Was it a big deal?
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.560]   Going to it?
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.800]   No, the ride homes?
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.640]   Because you'd seen it?
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.280]   Yeah, well, I wasn't really exposed to much of the hype of it.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.160]   But the experience of watching the movie was pretty amazing.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.040]   That was already pretty heavy and the sci-fi is a little kid.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.280]   It's funny when you see it now, it really looks dated.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.960]   I mean, the special effects are just, you know,
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.400]   obviously special effects.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.720]   And it's kind of cheesy.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.480]   And yet at the time, it was mind-blowing.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.800]   Yeah, at the time was way ahead of its time.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.920]   And I remember the movie that Disney decided to come out
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.720]   to show that these guys, these newcomers, these newbies,
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.080]   didn't know what they were doing.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.280]   And so Disney said, we're going to show you how to do it right.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.440]   And with all their old mats and stuff that didn't even look good,
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.680]   they came out of the movie called The Black Hole.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.560]   That was awful.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.440]   It was awful.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.160]   And it was supposed to be the Star Wars killer.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.040]   That would be great to--
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.640]   That was actually a fun movie to watch.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.120]   I agree.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.840]   There was, indeed, it's a right--
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.160]   Who was the main actor in that with the robots?
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.200]   The robots were great.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.320]   IMDB, baby.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.040]   One of the top sites, by the way, on the world is IMDB.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.680]   Because everybody goes there.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.360]   1979.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.880]   The Black Hole.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.720]   You have the cast list in front of you.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.480]   We'll have an IMDB race.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.160]   That's who it was, Dr. Hans Righthart.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.400]   And Robert Foster, Ernest Borgnine.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.000]   Ernest Borgnine.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.440]   And Pickens.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:08.880]   The voice is on.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.920]   Slim Pickens.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.000]   Yeah, what a movie.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.240]   What a cast.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.800]   Yvette Mimi-U as Dr. Kate McCray.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.480]   Roddy McDowell as the voice of the robot, Vincent.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.400]   Might as have just been lost in space.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.240]   It really was.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.680]   Vital Vincent Stanford.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.880]   Vital information necessary centralized.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.360]   Wow.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.120]   I'm going to have to-- I'm going to absolutely have to rent this.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.320]   I wonder if it's on Netflix.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.480]   Have you ever seen it?
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.320]   No.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.880]   Oh, it's hilarious.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.800]   Tony Perkins.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.200]   Anthony Perkins was in this.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:39.600]   Not Tony.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.320]   Yeah, it's hilarious because it's so bad.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.840]   It's almost campy.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.760]   All right, the Black Hole.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.240]   Great movie if you were seven.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.520]   I bet it's not on Netflix.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.960]   I bet you anything is not on Netflix.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.280]   Oh, you know, you might be-- you're probably right.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.800]   Available.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.160]   Yeah, it sits out on DVD.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:54.520]   It is.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.880]   Oh, and Netflix will have it.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.640]   Well, it's probably-- it's one of those--
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.240]   it's one of those if you have to get join a club.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.000]   This is one of the free ones I'll give away.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.400]   Look, Disney's amazing Black Hole.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.920]   Special effects you won't believe.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.320]   And Roddy McDowell as the robot.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   Yeah, it's on Netflix.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.800]   2 and 1/2 stars.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.040]   I'm adding it to my cue.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.720]   I'm doing a little Jerry Lewis film fest.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.240]   I think you'll fit right in.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   Lady!
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.280]   Lady!
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.920]   I'm reading the Jerry Lewis biography.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.200]   Merlin Mann turned me onto this and Andy and I go.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.440]   And it's a hoot.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.560]   But it makes you want to see his films.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.520]   Just, you know, I don't know why.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.600]   There's a lot of really--
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.200]   I'm not really able to get into a single film of him.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.520]   No, they're awful.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.000]   Although I--
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.960]   No, that's--
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.720]   I think you might reconsider that if you want to look back
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.120]   at him.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.200]   Here's what-- here's the way I always
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.400]   say to look at a Jerry Lewis movie.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.520]   And you wonder why he's so popular in France.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.760]   If you look at a Jerry Lewis movie and think of it
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.960]   as a European film with subtitles,
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.960]   you realize these are works of art.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.880]   And the funny thing--
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.280]   It's very physical comedy.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.480]   I mean--
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.720]   And the other thing is that many of his best movies
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.960]   in that vein have never been put on DVD.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.320]   You have to catch him on Turner Classics or something
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.440]   like that.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.040]   Well, my friend Irma, which I think was his first,
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.880]   is on my Netflix list, my next Netflix.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.480]   And I just got--
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.120]   I can't remember the name of it, one of them.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.720]   But this is pre-nutty professor.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.560]   This is early days, Jerry Lewis.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.880]   How do we get into this?
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:32.280]   Oh, Star Wars, 30th anniversary via Black Hole.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.800]   Lucas, which is kind of neat, is putting 250 clips
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.360]   from the movies on Star Wars.com.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.760]   I've been looking for those for all day.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.920]   They haven't gone up yet?
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.480]   And I still-- they may be up.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.320]   I just can't find them on the starwars.com.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.600]   I wonder if they're on I-Spots.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.440]   They're using the I-Spots technology.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.680]   I-Spots is a really neat kind of video mashup site
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.040]   where you could upload your own clips.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.800]   Oh, it's running right now in the background.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   Somebody's video.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.880]   Oh, it's pretty.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.720]   You upload all your own clips.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.960]   And then you can mix them with other existing found footage
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   and stuff.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.760]   And so if you had the Star Wars stuff,
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.160]   and you could mix your own clips in,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.080]   you could do some fun stuff.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.000]   I bet they do.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.840]   Look good for Lucas for saying, you know.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.280]   Go ahead and do it.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.840]   Oh, come on.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.280]   I'm totally the opposite on this.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.680]   No.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.640]   Years and years have gone by with him moaning and growing up.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.160]   That's true.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.400]   People stealing his clips.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.760]   And now that this franchise is pretty much over and dead,
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.640]   he releases them and encourages people to use them
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.560]   so you maybe sell a few more toys.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.960]   All right, you're right.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.520]   I mean, how many versions of the DVDs he released
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.480]   without actually releasing the original versions of the movie?
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   I don't know if this is a joke.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.080]   And let's talk about Greedo shooting first.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.320]   I'm still miffed about that.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.320]   Talking about the whole Jar Jar bit.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.040]   And sucker punch.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.040]   The real release.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.240]   You know, the whole point of Han Solo
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.280]   is that he shot him first.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.600]   He was a bad man.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.160]   Redemption story.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.320]   No idea what he's talking about.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.920]   Go watch Star Wars to figure it out.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.480]   Go watch the VHS tape, then watch
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.520]   the spiffy renewed version of it.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.240]   Greedo shot first.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.800]   All I know is the whole thing went into the tank
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.880]   when the Darth Vader--
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:14.040]   new Darth Vader character yells, oh no.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.540]   Oh.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:18.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.240]   It reminds me of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.480]   although it wasn't quite oh no that they shouted when they
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.160]   jumped off that cliff.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.920]   Apparently, their Jar Jar binks.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.200]   Cuts you can edit.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.080]   Oh, great.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.240]   That might be fun.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.680]   No nudity allowed.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.680]   You can have--
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.000]   what do you mean no nudity allowed?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.760]   You can't put any nudity in these mashups.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.680]   Who says?
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.760]   Is it in the license?
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.560]   I don't know.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.000]   That's what it says.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.040]   There's a team of people in Costa Rica
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.680]   who are reviewing all of the mashups.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.640]   What about using them for having them cuss?
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.560]   Does that sound like a joke?
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.800]   A team of screeners based in Costa Rica
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.880]   will watch each video before it goes live.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.280]   This is the Wall Street Journal, so it must be true.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.880]   Why does it have to be in Costa Rica?
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.360]   What does that get to do with this story?
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.240]   That's kind of a non-sequitur.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.520]   The mashup project will come with rules, however.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.840]   While it won't stop anybody from assailing characters
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.520]   or casting them in unexpected lights,
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.880]   I spot has set up a program to make sure none of the doctored
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.360]   clips contain nudity, pornography, and the like.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:20.880]   The like.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.240]   And the like.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.200]   As a backup of team of screeners based in Costa Rica,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.040]   we'll watch each video before it goes live.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.920]   Yeah, they'll be looking for buttocks.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.280]   No buttocks.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.080]   We won't have that halo-to thing happen here.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.040]   Not on my watch.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.480]   You're right.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.720]   I think Lucas has been fairly good about allowing fan films.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.320]   He hasn't been as heavy handed as he could.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.160]   I heard that he was really bent out of shape over that one
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.000]   version of the, I think it was the first prequel where
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.160]   we're doing the head all the Jar Jar being scenes and
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.320]   somebody re-edited the entire movie without Jar Jar being
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.120]   just that just a mouth.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.920]   I can't look that.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.240]   You know, just to prove that he wasn't needed in the movie.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.520]   It was stupid.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.160]   That would but see that pissed him off because it was an
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:12.440]   assault on his, you know, creativity as a as a.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.040]   His authority as an auteur working in the.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.040]   Exactly.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.240]   Have you seen Chad Vader?
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.080]   I love that.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.720]   Yeah, it's a good one.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:25.360]   Wonderful video podcast with the dark.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   Dark son.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.080]   I threw the Senate at him.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.160]   The whole Senate.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.160]   Who's not?
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.000]   Oh my God.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.160]   That is so funny.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.160]   They come out of my nose.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   Just looking at some of these match ups.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.160]   You can watch a lot of these on YouTube.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   They're kind of fun.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   And I mean, you know, to his credit, they're still there.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   They're not, you know, they haven't been cold-beared.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   But they were actually cold-bearing a lot of it.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   Were they?
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.160]   See, there you go.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   Well, I don't know who to believe.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.160]   What does that mean?
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.160]   Cold-bearing?
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.160]   Where you're coming, you're not, you know, you cease and
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.160]   desist, you yank them down, you demand a pull-down.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   What is it called?
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.160]   Cold-bearing.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.160]   I don't know, but I just made that up, but I think it's appropriate.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.160]   Because a lot of people...
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.160]   I just made up the term like the Cold-bear report.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   The Viacom pulled down all of the cold-bear.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.160]   Oh, right, right, right.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.160]   Cold-bearing.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.160]   Yeah, that might work.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.160]   That could catch on.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.160]   You've been cold-bearing.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.160]   Good catch on.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   Slowly.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.160]   Hey, I'm not the fastest guy in the world all the time.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.160]   That might catch on.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   You can break your arm if you crank it wrong.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   What?
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.160]   Breaking DVD DRM is legal in Finland.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.160]   Yay.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.160]   We love the Finns.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   We love the...
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   I do love the Finns.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.160]   I'm having a party, by the way.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.160]   We're having a party in Finland.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.160]   With Finnish herring, you're all invited to the party.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   We're doing with Jaikou.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.160]   It's kind of our 100th anniversary party, except not really.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   Oh, yeah, what is this party?
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.160]   I have to keep mentioning it.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   I'd never get invited to...
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   You are invited.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.160]   I sent you an invite.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   I didn't get it.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   Upcoming.org.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160]   I'll just go to upcoming.org.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.160]   Now we know why John doesn't get spammed, because he doesn't get a lot of rest.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.160]   That's true.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   I didn't invite you.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.160]   Ooh, email.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   E-mail.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.160]   It's June.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.160]   Actually, I have to look it up.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   It's June something, 12th, I think.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   If you go to upcoming.org, you're all invited.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   Jaikou is the Finnish Twitter.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.160]   Twitter.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.160]   Yeah, that's what I use instead of Twitter, because I don't want to have the...
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.160]   I don't want to give them the trademark.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   They're now like seven different Twitter competitors.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.160]   I think I'm going to buy laughs.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   But there were before Twitter came along, because Google owns Dodgeball, which was one of the
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.160]   first.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.160]   Yeah, but they shut Dodgeball down.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.160]   Yeah, the guy's all left, because Google wasn't doing anything with it.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.160]   They were watching Twitter get more and more successful, and they said, "Google."
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   Oh, I didn't know that whole story.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   That's interesting, because that says to me that Google slowly morphing into another Yahoo.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.160]   They are.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   They're acquiring the stuff and misusing it.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.160]   I agree.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.160]   I agree.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.160]   Have you guys seen the URL redirect?
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:05.160]   They're doing the DNS redirect that they've partnered up with Dell on.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   They've very much code on all the new Dell machines that does a special Dell Google.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.660]   If you type in the wrong URL and it does a redirect to what looks like a Google search
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:20.160]   page, except for the entire top two thirds, most of the time you go to the page is actually...
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.160]   Oh, that's sneaky.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.160]   It's actually advertising stuff.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:27.160]   They're changing the hosts file so that when you get a 404...
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   Well, they basically have a little... they basically have some code, some lines buried.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.160]   You can remove it.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.160]   It's just a non-trivial ever to...
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   That's scummy.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.160]   To remove that.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   Of course, if Dell wants to advertise on this show, it's not scummy at all, but until they
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]   do.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   Well, how about Dell paying you?
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   No, they finally... well, I haven't gotten a check yet, but apparently they check has
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.160]   been cut and has been sent to our agency.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   That means good news, guys.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   You will get paid any day now.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.160]   As soon as I get the check.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.160]   Money will be flowing.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   This is the drawback to this whole setup.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:07.360]   I suddenly realize is that because I'm not paying you a salary, I'll pay you when we have
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.160]   advertising, but it takes so long to get the money by the time that you do.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   It shouldn't take that long.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.160]   That's just...
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   For God that you were getting paid in the first place.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.160]   And so the whole point of it is eliminated.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.600]   Yeah, somebody's like... I don't know.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.160]   That seems dubious to take that long to pay.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.160]   I've heard confirmation from various payments.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.160]   Really?
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.160]   Net 180?
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.160]   It's not unusual, apparently, in the advertising agency business.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.160]   It's not Dell, it's Dell's agency.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.360]   So Dell pays the agency.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.160]   The agency pays us, and then actually pays Podtrack.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.160]   Well, after a couple trips to Vegas.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.160]   I guess.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.160]   We're going to double this money.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   Anyway, according to the Finnish courts, I love this.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:53.680]   It's legal to break DRM because the law in Finland only protects DRM that's actually
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.920]   effective.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   So, because it's so easy to...
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   I love the logic.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   Isn't that great?
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:04.160]   It has to be effective DRM, or you don't have to worry.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   Fins don't talk like that.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.520]   I like the Swede you do, but it works as a fin.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   Who knows?
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.520]   Who knows who the Finn is.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.520]   Americans don't get out much.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.520]   The Finns...
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.520]   I do.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.520]   They sound like you're creating that old car.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.760]   They're much more like Russia than they are like Sweden.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.080]   Yes, but the Swedish voice is funnier.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.240]   I know, they don't like it.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.160]   The guy who...
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.960]   What are the fanners of Jiku?
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.720]   His name is spelled Y J-Y-R-I.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.320]   Now, how would you pronounce J-Y-R-I?
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.360]   Very carefully.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.680]   I would say like Jiri or Jerry.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   It's probably Jerry.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   It's Yuri.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   Yeah, that's what I meant.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   See, they're Russians.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.720]   They're just crypto-russians.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.040]   Well, they had their day.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.040]   They're right next door.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.200]   Right across the bay.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.960]   Yes, like you throw a stone and you hit a Russian.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   You're targeted.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.920]   We're going to know exactly why.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:58.640]   Any event Jiku, which is created by Finns and I are throwing a party.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.560]   Upcoming.org has the invitation somewhere.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.600]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.440]   Well, you're inviting all the listeners?
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.440]   Okay, cool.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.440]   It's open to the public.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.440]   It's kind of our anniversary.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.440]   It's kind of our anniversary.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.440]   Turn around on that one, John.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   Does that...
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440]   I think the last one is?
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   What's the most?
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   Yes.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   Yes.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.000]   They're going to have a bunch of food.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   They're going to have Finnish herring.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.600]   Will there be Finnish herring?
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.600]   I know it's Finnish herring.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.920]   It's now like that Danish stuff, I hope.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   What?
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.200]   Now, what's wrong with Danish herring?
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.840]   Oh, they got a herring that they just love to eat.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.040]   I like herring a lot, by the way.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.680]   But I like my herring to be pickled.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   I don't like just a...
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.680]   No, no.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   I think this is a...
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:45.840]   soaked in oil, and then they added with some flavors that make it even more sickening, and
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.360]   then eat it raw and dripping, so it just gets all over the place and makes you burp
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   for days.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.560]   That is not an appealing dish to me.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.720]   Well, in that case, you might want to come to our party.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.880]   You've really made it an exciting invite.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:04.280]   June 19th, 6 to 10 p.m. come, you'll be burping for days.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.400]   Citizen space, 425 Second Street, number 300 San Francisco.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   You're all invited.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.400]   So, upcoming.org and say you're attending.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.840]   A lot of salted herring.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.400]   I don't know what Finnish herring is like.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.120]   I don't know if it's burp all night, or...
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.120]   Usually.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.320]   I think any kind of fish, if you just kind of eat it, you'll be burping.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.320]   Oh, and...
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.400]   Oh, no, it's pickled.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.000]   It says, and I'm looking at the invitation.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.560]   It says, "Eat the finest pickled herring from Finland."
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.360]   Okay, I think I've had that herring there.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.000]   They have it like it's just pickled, but then they have a lot of flavor with a lot of
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.720]   dill and some of these other things.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.720]   Delicious.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   It's going to be delicious.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.440]   Hey, as a side note, I think this is like a tech podcast.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.640]   We got hands on with the Zombu $99 PC on DLTV.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.920]   Oh, I heard that.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.480]   I haven't seen the episode yet.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.240]   I'm sorry I didn't hear it.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.280]   Run to DL.tv and download it now.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.280]   It's interesting actually.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.440]   It's a $100 PC.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.760]   Well, yeah, how?
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.240]   Tell us about it, Patrick.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.920]   Well, it's a $100 PC if you subscribe to a two-year 1295 a month subscribe.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.000]   Oh, it's the same old free PC scale.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.360]   That's not a free piece.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   That's not a $100.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   Well, it's $100 up front.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.600]   It's like people PC.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.120]   It's that when they Gary Korn was a dog.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.560]   I've used a people PC.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.040]   This is a lot better than a people PC.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.400]   All right, so it's a decent computer.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.400]   Is it running Vista?
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.800]   No, it's actually it's running a lockdown version of Linux.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   It's kind of if you've ever--
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.640]   Is that a contradiction in terms of a lockdown version of Linux?
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.640]   Yes, actually.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   Think about it this way.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:37.200]   If you ever have that friend that always downloads the file that kills this thing and they--
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.800]   This is the kind of box you may want to give it to them.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   Now, is it dial up service that you are buying or--
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.160]   There's no service included with it.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.760]   They have--
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.280]   What do you pay them for by the months?
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.000]   Well, you know what?
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.160]   Management, online storage, and a couple other things.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.000]   So let's stop you right here, Patrick.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.560]   Is the person that demoed this for you?
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.720]   It's some really hot woman.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.320]   Is that the reason that you're so jacked up about this?
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.400]   Wait, let me figure this out.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.840]   It's $100 down.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.600]   And how much--
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.920]   There's definitely some issues with it.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.200]   How much a month?
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.440]   It's $12.95 a month.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.680]   Or you can buy it outright for $249.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:16.840]   It's basically a silent via powered box that runs Linux.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.440]   Oh, that sounds good.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:17.800]   No fans.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.840]   It's called the files online.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.560]   No fans.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.920]   Yeah, $250 is about right.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.600]   That's not bad.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.560]   So if you--
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.480]   If the $250 version of it's completely open,
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.680]   you can put whatever you want on it.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.480]   The $100 version is locked down.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.880]   Can you watch DVDs on it, though?
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.040]   Because it's Linux.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.520]   Yes, actually.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.720]   You can't actually--
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.960]   If it has a myth TV, you could.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.800]   You can get a copy of myth TV for free,
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.760]   and that'll play a DVD.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.680]   That's not so, yeah.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.880]   So will the LC.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.240]   I thought that's breaking CSS to do that.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.280]   Well, you know what?
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.440]   I'll go into that conversation.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.840]   We did we ever talk about Microsoft?
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.400]   Why is that cop from Detroit's not around who's noticing?
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.320]   You're in trouble, buddy.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:02.200]   Did we ever talk about Microsoft and their patent thing
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.400]   with Linux on this show?
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   Did we talk about that last week?
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.840]   Did we ever rattle ink?
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:06.640]   Yeah, we did.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.600]   We did talk about that.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.440]   But it seems to have died down, and now Microsoft's denying
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.960]   that they're making any such threats.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.320]   We're not going to sue.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.000]   They say they have no immediate plans to sue.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   You know what?
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.840]   This is so obviously now an attempt
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.560]   to create a perception in the mind of somebody who's not
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.600]   paying real close attention that somehow Linux
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   is illegal, and you better stay away from it.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.800]   It's not, you know, it's designed for either somebody
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.480]   who's kind of not real technically literate or--
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.040]   We never used Linux in the first place.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:39.880]   Well, that's true.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.600]   But obviously Microsoft feels threatened.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.280]   Or the corporate CIO who is so terrified of exposure
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.440]   of any kind that he's just going to say,
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.920]   "I'm not going to take the chance.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.960]   Let's buy Vista."
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.200]   Yeah, the American Weasel.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.600]   The corporate CEO who's willing to make a ridiculously--
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.480]   Yeah, the American Weasel.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.000]   Although the flip side is that they do have, you know,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.960]   they have a patent swap agreement
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.160]   with their own sort of related version of Linux.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.120]   The SUSA thing, or is there something else?
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:07.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.040]   Yeah, but I guess we did talk about this
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.760]   because we mentioned the fact that the GPL3 would kind of,
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   if they enforced this voucher deal, open source Microsoft stuff.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.880]   I like that thought.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.960]   That made me happy.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.400]   I love that.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.760]   Whoops.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.680]   Hey, speaking of-- oops, the Recording Industry
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   Association of America now has decided that they're not greedy enough.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.600]   They need to be more greedy.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.600]   They're going after radio stations, not internet radio stations.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.560]   This actually isn't the RIAA, though.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.800]   It's the actual agency that collects royalties
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.040]   on behalf of performers.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.640]   Well, OK, I'm reading the LA Times article.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.480]   I'm not saying it's going to be wrong.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.440]   RIA is still evil, but this is actually--
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.640]   It's the RIAA--
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.480]   It's the RIAA.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.240]   Oh, according to the Times, it's the RIAA and several artists'
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.160]   groups.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.280]   They're pushing Congress to repeal the exemption that
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.560]   allows radio to not pay royalties to perform--
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.720]   these are performance royalties, right?
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.040]   Oh, you mean the one that was put down in the 30s where
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.600]   a rated didn't have to pay royalties?
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.000]   Because everybody recognized that radio was an incredible tool
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.480]   for promoting music and that the Recording Industry had
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.720]   incredible benefits thereof that they fundamental didn't
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.760]   have to pay for?
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.800]   Right, and the same group that used to actually do pay Olab,
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.160]   they pay you to--
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.960]   You know, they'd be cool.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.200]   Olab stopped at Allen Freet, John.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.520]   Yeah, right.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.400]   You know, I remember getting albums with this white powder
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.840]   in it, and I just-- with such a pain,
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.560]   you'd have to get the dustbuster and clear.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.880]   I don't know what that was.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.680]   What a mess.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.120]   You made a lot of money selling around.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.120]   If I only had none--
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:38.920]   Around the campus.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.880]   I did feel-- my fingers were a little numb afterwards.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.240]   I don't know what that was all about.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.640]   But that was for something else.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.680]   The wreath, the old saying is, according to Chris Castle,
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.800]   a music industry lawyer, probably wearing
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.840]   a very fine suit.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.600]   The old saying is, the reason broadcasters don't pay a
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   performance royalty is there's a radio station in every
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.960]   congressional district in a record company in only three.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.520]   Oh.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.040]   Yeah, hey, you know what?
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.360]   This is kind of perfect, actually, because once they've
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:09.280]   finished killing off internet racing, we had a 60-day
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:09.800]   repair.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.320]   Right.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.680]   Immediately, once the--
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.200]   Well, you know, the RIA now stepping in to kill off
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.120]   terrestrial radio.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.280]   Yeah, their greed has no limit.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.520]   Well, stupidity is not what--
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.320]   it's not greed.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.400]   It's stupidity.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.840]   Like Patrick said, I'm in 100% agreement with him on this,
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.560]   which is these guys need the radio to market their material.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.920]   They should be paying people to play the music.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.280]   They shouldn't be collecting people from people for playing
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:36.800]   the music.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.680]   They should be paying.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.080]   It's advertising.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.400]   Are these guys that stupid?
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.320]   Well, in the interest--
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.000]   Actually, John, the next step is every time you think
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.720]   about music, you'll owe them a nickel.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.280]   In the interest of fairness, let's ask the artists.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:53.720]   Mary--
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.360]   You sing that song to yourself.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.840]   Mary Wilson.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.040]   Mary Wilson, who you may remember as one
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:03.040]   of the original Supremes, she's 63 years old now,
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.080]   lives in Las Vegas.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.600]   Actually, when she's being quoted, she
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.520]   was in Milwaukee at the Potawatomi Bingo Casino,
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.000]   where she's singing.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.200]   After so many years of not being compensated,
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:20.320]   it would be nice now at this late date to at least start.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.560]   They've gotten 50 some years of free play.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.240]   Maybe it's time to pay up.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.160]   Well, what's interesting, right, is whether or not
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.640]   she would even see any of that music.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.200]   Well, she won't.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.720]   She wouldn't see a nickel.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.760]   According artists got completely
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.080]   hopes on their contracts by their managers
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   and by the recording company.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.160]   She's not going to see anything.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.080]   You know this goes straight in the pockets of the record
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:40.920]   company.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.200]   It's unbelievable.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.600]   National Association broadcaster
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.040]   says the royalties are a performance tax that
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.400]   would upend the 70-year mutually beneficial relationship
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.280]   between radio stations and the recording industry.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.360]   The NAB's got their act together by saying that.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.200]   That's exactly right.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.760]   It's mutually beneficial.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.800]   It's kind of hard to believe that the record company still
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.600]   do not get this.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   Well, they should talk to those old Paola guys
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.320]   and have them explain it to them.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.960]   Hey, where is Alan freed now that we need him?
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.040]   So John, you have an article on MarketWatch
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.280]   about Dell and Walmart.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.680]   Dell has announced it's going to start selling PCs in Walmart.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.000]   Yeah, I got that article.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.320]   Actually, it was an idea that was given to me by CNBC
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:29.160]   when I did their show on Thursday when this was announced.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.600]   And I tried to debate with some guy on the TV set there
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.520]   with the--
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.960]   On the TV?
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.120]   Yeah, the TV set where the waves go through the air.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.960]   Yeah, he and I were told agreement,
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.200]   which means I won't get booked again for weeks.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.360]   But you've got to find an area of disagreement.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.280]   You've got to be arguing or they don't like you.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.080]   But anyway, the fact that--
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.400]   I thought about this more and more.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.920]   And I've come into the conclusion that it's not just,
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   as you say, and a lot of other people
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.360]   say it just cheapens the brand to go to Walmart.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.760]   But HP is there and Apple's there.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.880]   And it's really not cheapening the brand that much.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.360]   It's just not helping.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   But I came to the conclusion that it's because Dell--
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.760]   they've not made the transformation
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.400]   into being a company that can merchandise their products
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.480]   with nice designs and something people want to buy.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.560]   I mean, their machines aren't very good looking.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.120]   But what's wrong with selling in Walmart?
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.400]   It's just another gigantic channel.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.280]   Well, that's a big channel.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.160]   But what makes a difference if you're lined up
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.640]   and they're all going to be the same price
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.800]   and there's some cheap EverX machines, they're like 300 bucks.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.600]   But anyway, you have them all lined up next to each other.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.440]   And since all the machines are made in China
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.000]   at the same two factories--
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.360]   So there's no differentiation.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.600]   There's really no differentiation,
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.280]   except which ones are cool looking.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.840]   And Dell doesn't get that in the least.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:44.160]   I mean, they bought that--
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.200]   what company did they buy Voodoo or--
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:47.920]   It was Voodoo?
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.640]   The gaming PC company, yeah.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.280]   And they had some cool looking designs.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.000]   But not much of it.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.440]   I like my dimension 710 with the red lights.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.440]   It's so pretty.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.640]   But-- Yeah, well, that's going in the right direction.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.640]   But there's enough of that.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.480]   I don't think PC owners care in the least about that.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.840]   I mean, there's that small group of people who like to mod.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.340]   Really?
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.820]   They're not attracted to things that are pretty.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:09.940]   So really, so really the--
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.180]   because for years, people would--
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.980]   remember Acer, the Aspire?
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.740]   Companies tried to make good looking PCs,
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.700]   and they just didn't sell better than the beige boxes.
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.660]   Those machines were ugly.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.860]   Well, you're right.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:21.580]   They were ugly.
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:23.940]   They were in attempts to make an attractive machine.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.740]   I mean, I remember one Acer machine
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.340]   that had a bunch of holes in the side of it,
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.140]   and some random hat.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:29.860]   That's the Aspire.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.740]   Yeah, that was the Aspire.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.460]   Yeah, and I'd say, would somebody take a shotgun
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:33.220]   to this thing?
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.220]   The same fine people who bring you the sling box,
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:40.340]   bring you the Acer Aspire.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:40.820]   So you just--
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.020]   I like the sling box.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.900]   Yeah, I like how it works, but you can't--
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.980]   I actually like the looks of it.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.780]   You like the thing that looks like a plastic brick?
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:48.220]   Just do.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:48.720]   Sorry.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.940]   It looks like art.
[00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:51.700]   It looks like art.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:52.060]   OK.
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:52.940]   That was-- it looks like art.
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:55.540]   Go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York and catch up.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:58.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.700]   I don't-- this is another-- this is another might--
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.580]   I almost don't even want to report this story.
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.780]   It might happen, Story.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.620]   The state and local governments, once again,
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.740]   are lobbying Congress.
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:12.460]   They want to get their sales taxes on net sales.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.380]   Companies like Amazon don't necessarily
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.780]   levy the sales tax.
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.380]   In fact, that's why people-- that's like me--
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:20.300]   shop at Amazon, although in California,
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.660]   we have to pay sales tax on a lot of these places.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.420]   So they want to go out the law changed.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.740]   Yeah, they want more money.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:29.460]   More money.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:30.980]   It's kind of like the RIAA.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.340]   Although they have a pretty good case,
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.140]   it means a brick and mortar merchant
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:37.660]   is at a disadvantage because he has to charge sales taxes.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.540]   The brick and mortar merchants at an advantage.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.060]   Why?
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.980]   Because you can go in and look at the product.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:44.780]   They can merchandize.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.260]   They can have somebody come over and say, hey,
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:46.900]   this is pretty good.
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:48.540]   You should buy it now.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.260]   I don't think people, when they buy at a local store,
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.260]   are thinking about tax.
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.740]   And so when you buy it at the brick and mortar,
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.260]   you're buying it because it's merchandise to use being sold to you.
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.340]   And then you pay the tax afterwards.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:03.220]   You're not thinking, maybe I can go to Amazon and get it cheaper.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.300]   But I do actually think that.
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.500]   I think--
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.700]   Well, I guess you would.
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.860]   There's actually a lot of smaller vendors
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.980]   like in front of my ran a windsurfing shop and still does,
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:17.300]   but branched out a lot because he found out a lot of people
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.100]   would come into his store, test everything out,
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.820]   spend two hours asking questions, decide
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:24.620]   on what they wanted to buy, suddenly realize they had to go
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.300]   to the bathroom, run out, and buy stuff online.
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.140]   Happens all the time.
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:31.980]   I have a client that's a camera store in LA.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.060]   Yeah, but I don't think it's because of the tax, Patrick.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.140]   I think it's because online, some of these online stores
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.980]   really have much better deals.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.940]   Well, I mean, it's interesting, yeah.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.500]   Tax is a minor part of it, but also the online source.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.740]   They don't have to deal with--
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.620]   The online source don't have to deal with inventory.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:47.460]   Let me rephrase it.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.940]   They don't have to deal with keeping a retail space open.
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.300]   They don't have the taxes.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.940]   They don't have some of the overhead--
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.740]   Which business would you rather be in right now, John?
[00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:00.740]   A camera store on La Brea or an online camera store?
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.540]   Well, I'd rather be online because I--
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.460]   The drive to La Brea, that's like eight hours.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:09.460]   Off to the target, we go.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.860]   You know, California, we're supposed
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.580]   to voluntarily pay the sales tax.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.260]   I misstated myself.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.020]   I don't pay sales tax on Amazon, but I'm supposed
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.500]   to keep track of it and pay it at the end of the year.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:19.860]   To who?
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.500]   Oh, John, you have been looking at your California state return.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.700]   Well, see, here's the thing that in the way I see it.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:29.100]   Amazon-- why is Amazon collecting money for California?
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:30.260]   It just doesn't make sense to me.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:30.780]   They're not.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.380]   So you're supposed to do it yourself.
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:33.980]   Californians are voluntarily--
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.900]   supposed to voluntarily pay your sales tax.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.700]   For stuff I buy in Washington state.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.060]   Yes.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.060]   They actually ask you.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:44.500]   It's actually a line on the California state.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.100]   Well, I buy only from brick and mortar, so it's me too.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.300]   I never buy online.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.060]   So I have never violated whatever new law it is.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.220]   And I don't want to hear from that Detroit cop either.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.140]   No, never.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.940]   Bill Gates--
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:57.580]   Go ahead.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:58.080]   Sorry.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.420]   I was going to say if anybody's out there and they're
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.700]   having to be poaching a Wi-Fi signal and someone comes up to them,
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.420]   just tell the guy, hey, this is off of a DVD.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.900]   There's nothing like Wi-Fi.
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.540]   What's that?
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.900]   What is Wi-Fi?
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.100]   I'm just watching the DVD of my mail.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.820]   Are you going to the D conference?
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.820]   The Geek Conference.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.300]   The D conference.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.460]   The D conference.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.540]   Mossberg owns the letter--
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.060]   It's already over, isn't it?
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.260]   The letter D.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.260]   Is it over?
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.580]   Didn't they do that already?
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.100]   No, no.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.580]   It's coming up on the 30th next week.
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:32.740]   I thought it was a done deal.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.700]   I thought it was like months ago.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.340]   No, no, no.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.260]   And not only that--
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.420]   It's going to be the first time ever, jobs and gates
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:44.700]   will be on the same stage for a 75-minute joint interview.
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:48.580]   Why am I looking at photos of jobs and gates if they were at one party?
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.860]   That wasn't a public event.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:51.100]   You couldn't hear what they were saying.
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.420]   Although I like on devoreg.org/blog.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.580]   You're coming on Bill Gates' makeup.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.500]   What's the story there?
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.780]   You think he looks like a vampire?
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.260]   Is that it?
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.660]   Well, it seemed pretty peculiar.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.180]   But the joke got near that I don't think anyone picked up on it,
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.100]   and of course, now they will.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.660]   But they think it'll scroll off by the time
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.940]   this gets sent out.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:14.700]   I said Bill Gates is sitting next to an apparent cotger.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.700]   I never mentioned that.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.340]   Nobody said, hey, that's Steve Jobs.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.500]   It looks like an old man.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.340]   Compared to Bill and his fine makeup, do you think Bill's wearing makeup?
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.620]   Well, I'm not saying he is.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.540]   I'm just saying his hand looked a little peculiar.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:31.700]   You know, when you work TV, people out there should know you.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.220]   You can wear hand makeup.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.060]   People who are really pale like myself,
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.620]   and if they're going to make you up so you have maybe a little darker tone
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.380]   so you don't look like you're dead when you're on camera,
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.660]   you have to ask them.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:45.340]   You have to specifically ask the makeup artist to put hand makeup on.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.220]   Otherwise, you look like you've got vampire hands.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.700]   Well, yeah, because what happens is that you're talking and you look pretty normal
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:55.340]   and you lift your hand for some reason, there's a white hand.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.420]   It just doesn't work.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.500]   You know, so you always have to ask for hand makeup.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.940]   And you have to ask for it too, because the makeup people always forget.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:04.740]   Mommy, that technology punted his dad.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.300]   So the D Conference is in Carlsbad, California, just down the road from La Brea.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:12.100]   D stands for All Things Digital.
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.220]   And Gates and Jobs will be for the first--
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.420]   It says, according to the Wall Street Journal, the first time ever,
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.060]   sharing a--
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.580]   actually having a conversation in public,
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.900]   they shared a stage in an '83 at an Apple event.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:29.420]   And of course, Gates made a famous phone call to Jobs in '97.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.780]   But on Wednesday, they're sitting down for a 75-minute joint interview
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.060]   in front of a gathering of high-tech executives.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:35.820]   Well, you know what?
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.740]   They're going to stream it somewhere, so I'll just watch it then.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.180]   I'd love to see it.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.540]   Oh, why?
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.700]   Because they won't say anything important, will they?
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.300]   No, they'll probably just be nice to each other.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.820]   And then they'll call up later.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.780]   The purchase.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.220]   Of what?
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:49.980]   By whom?
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.860]   By what?
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.980]   Which word were we going to start?
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.740]   Microsoft purchase Apple, Apple purchase Microsoft.
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:03.620]   Google purchase
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.820]   The Zoon and the iPod into a third-party corporation.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.220]   Did you blog that-- John, that hysterical, sad picture of the-- in front of the Zoon offices,
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.180]   where you turn in your old iPod for as soon.
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:15.580]   There's like a pack of cigarettes, a couple of iPods, and a Zen.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.660]   Like, there's like three things in it.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.660]   It's like a trash bin.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.460]   It's so sad.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.900]   Yeah, it's pretty pathetic.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.300]   Who's going to turn in an iPod and a Zoon?
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:25.820]   You'd be crazy.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.740]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:27.540]   They keep trying this.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.540]   They apparently did this at the press event for the Zoon.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.540]   They told all the journalists and attendants before-- you know, the invitation said,
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.500]   "Bring your old iPod.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.220]   We'll trade it in for a Zoon."
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.300]   If you got-- maybe you have some friends that-- well, you probably have about 10 of them
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:38.940]   from what I can--
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:39.900]   Yeah, but I still would.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.620]   You must have a couple of junkers that don't work anymore.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.460]   I got one in front of me.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:45.420]   I got one in front of me that just died, the hard drive I've got taken to the party.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.740]   Yeah, but that Microsoft.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.260]   Yeah, I could put it in their Zoon amnesty bin.
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.140]   All right, let's wrap this up.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.980]   Before we go, though, I want to mention--
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.380]   John's made a little news.
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:59.580]   You are now a vice president at Podshow.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.380]   Yeah, they had to give me some title instead of the money I deserve.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.060]   So yeah, I'm going to be over there.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.180]   I've been developing a five-minute news update.
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:09.780]   And then there's a thing we're doing, the whole network's doing,
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.100]   which is going to be put together.
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:12.820]   It's kind of a--
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:13.420]   It's a channel.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:14.260]   It's a tech channel.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.540]   It's not really a channel of anything new, though.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.980]   That's what people don't fully understand.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.220]   So that's the existing tech stuff.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.540]   The 4X stamp of approval on all of you.
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:23.860]   It's a basically--
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.540]   Yeah, I'm Lewis.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.380]   Callie, Lee Callie, Adam, show, probably.
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.820]   Text your original.
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.700]   And definitely Patrick's show.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.100]   My show.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.540]   Yeah, I mean, the idea here is not-- we're not producing new stuff.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.340]   What we're going to do is--
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:37.700]   Why my show?
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.500]   It's essentially considered an aggregator on steroids
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.300]   with that's moderated.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.740]   But John, I read the press release.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.900]   This is a completely new concept in technology.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.860]   Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.060]   I'm back in technology that when they finally roll it out
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.820]   is a completely new concept.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:52.700]   Well, tell me something.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.260]   They're going to aggregate my shows just every--
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.340]   They already do.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:57.420]   They do?
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.460]   Without my permission?
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.060]   They don't have to have your permission.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.260]   You have an RSS feed.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.460]   It's this open game.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.020]   Oh, so they're going to have a feed reader.
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.060]   I'm the guy.
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:08.060]   You're talking to me.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:08.980]   OK, you're going to have--
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.700]   You want to get distribution?
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.940]   They're going to have--
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.340]   I don't know.
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:16.020]   So what you're saying is it's a feed reader, an aggregator.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.580]   Yeah, hello.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.140]   It's a cheater.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.100]   But it's not just any old--
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.980]   Is it the vice president of a feed reader?
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.940]   I'm going to do a concept in media aggregator.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.020]   No, I'm telling you.
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:24.940]   I'm confused, John.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.060]   Just keep-- stay tuned when they roll out their--
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:28.580]   Ron Bloom says--
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.340]   Ron Bloom says--
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:30.380]   There's a steam behind this.
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.020]   Yeah, but there's--
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.660]   You're saying they're doing something cool with the $25 million--
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.340]   Feed reader.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.380]   They have to be feed--
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:37.620]   Ron Bloom says--
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.540]   Typical technology channels are really
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.300]   just listing the programming, featuring boring talking
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.060]   heads or uninformed rants.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.300]   Podshow tech will feature personality-driven content
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.340]   with a healthy dose of attitude, fair but not
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.700]   necessarily impartial.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:54.380]   Actually--
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.740]   But also exciting.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:58.580]   But what's funny is that it's exactly the way Ron talks.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.020]   Does he really?
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.820]   I just made that up.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:04.900]   Technology has given us this massive new distribution
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.260]   medium.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.100]   Actually, you know what?
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.740]   If you search for "Twit" on Podshow,
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.540]   the first thing that comes up is a delicious forward slash
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:12.300]   "Twit."
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.140]   Really?
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.340]   Well, there's probably some guy that did that.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.220]   I mean, you got to remember, Podshow, the website,
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.220]   is not that much different than blog spot-wise.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.100]   Well, it's by your podcast alley, kind of,
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.220]   which are they acquired.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:28.900]   So if I search under shows for "Twit" on Podshow,
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:29.500]   I'm doing it right now.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.740]   I find a bunch of fans there.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.900]   Delicious slash "Twit"-- Windows Weekly with Paul
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.020]   Thoreau, Tech Renegades, Radio, Leo,
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.460]   Iraq, was Jason Bryant.
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.260]   They don't in fact have "Twit" on here.
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.020]   I have "Twit" video.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:42.980]   Oh, there's "Twit" video.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:45.420]   We haven't done "Twit" video in months.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.300]   That's a year old.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.220]   By the way, before you go on with that search engine,
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:51.140]   it's going to be fixed.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.580]   It's not the world's biggest.
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.060]   But I like your go-daddy ads.
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.420]   Those are good.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.900]   The search engine needs to work.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.220]   Congratulations, anyway.
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.660]   I'm glad you got a job.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.620]   Yeah, I needed one.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.900]   You know, at the deli, we got to get going.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.420]   The deli?
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:05.660]   We're going to sleep at this point.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:06.460]   I mean--
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:06.960]   What?
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.460]   Are you going to sell--
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.060]   You're going to have like 14 columns, cranky geeks.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.820]   You participate in--
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.820]   I got time on my hands, believe it.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.140]   I'm a columnist of "aunt."
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.700]   The columns don't take that long to do.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.380]   A columnist of "aunt."
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.780]   I like it.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.900]   Yeah, a lot of people would make something else a "aunt."
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.620]   But that's another story.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:24.940]   All right.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.260]   Well, anyway, I don't know what it means.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.380]   But I congratulate you on it.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:30.860]   And we'll keep us informed on whatever it means.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.480]   You could find all you need to find out
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.780]   at the vork.org/blog.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.660]   Of course you can.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:37.540]   And of course, you could find out more about the $100 computer
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:41.300]   that really costs $250 from dl.tv.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.620]   We have other interesting stories, too.
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.460]   Lots of good stuff.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:44.980]   I love dl.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:46.060]   Did you bring the girl on?
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.060]   The one that showed you this computer?
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.780]   There was no girl showing the computer.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.340]   Zonbu.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.220]   I love Zonbu.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:58.140]   It sounds like, you know, Zonbu good, good computer.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.060]   Zonbu.
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.700]   Is that the name of it?
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.540]   Zonbu?
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.060]   Zonbu.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.060]   Zonbu.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:04.580]   Zonbu.
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:05.540]   The $99 PC.
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:06.040]   Zonbu.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:06.540]   Compuda.
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.060]   We have the information.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.540]   But they really spent a lot of money.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.540]   We have the viewer question.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.540]   We have some viewer questions.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.380]   Grand image.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.620]   Zonbu good.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.620]   Computer.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.180]   All right.
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.140]   I'm going to wrap this sucker up.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:17.980]   Yes, our next tweet will be episode 100.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.900]   I guess what I'm going to do.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.500]   I don't have anything particular to do.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.140]   We've had bad results giving things away, as you know,
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.340]   Patrick.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.380]   So I'm not giving anything, fiddly away.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.820]   There's many people that have been calling me and writing
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:32.460]   me about the box of junk.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.180]   I know.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:33.700]   I'll tell you what.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:38.020]   If anybody wants a box of junk, we'll send me an email,
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.980]   and I'll send you some stuff.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.620]   It costs more-- let me just point this out.
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.300]   It costs far more to ship this than it
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.780]   would be to go to your local junk store and buy it.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.100]   Depends on which box and which--
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:48.780]   No, it depends on which box.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.420]   You can ship really cheap, cheap, cheap.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.820]   It's not that debatable.
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:56.580]   It'll arrive in a container in seven months.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.980]   But why would be so thrilled?
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.980]   You know, what a great gag that would be to have some contest
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.660]   that we claim we're going to send all this junk,
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:04.660]   and we make a big list.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.940]   And then we ship them a complete cargo container.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.460]   Containments.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.980]   And drop it out in front of their house.
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:11.860]   Congratulations.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:13.700]   It's not just a box of junk.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:17.220]   It's a cargo container of junk.
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.780]   With all monitors.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.140]   Oh, god.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:20.860]   That's why I had--
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:21.300]   Stuff in staples.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:21.940]   I most don't want to do it.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.740]   Anyway, for the 100th episode, I think what we're going to do--
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.100]   I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.260]   We're going to have a party with Herring.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.060]   Well, we can do that.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.340]   We can do-- I think we should do some--
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:31.780]   I don't know.
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.300]   Should I ask?
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.100]   I think we should do a retrospective for one thing.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:34.420]   Oh, god.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.860]   Nobody wants that.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.980]   The problem with podcasts is reruns
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:41.260]   are available at any time just by going back in the feed.
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.260]   Or a searching pod show, because apparently, that's
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.740]   all you've got as old shows on there.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.820]   I'll tell you what, what could do-- and this would be nice.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:54.140]   If you wanted to record a greeting on our 100th episode
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.140]   and email it to us, you could do that.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.180]   How about that?
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.820]   That would be sentimental.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:01.500]   And maybe you could help me, John, get some big names
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.780]   to say, you know, hi, this is--
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:04.660]   That would be cool.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.780]   This is Condoleezza Rice wishing all of the guys
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.220]   that twitted a happy 100th episode or something.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:10.940]   That's what we need.
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.300]   We need a whole series of those.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.700]   All right, so let me think about how I'm going to do this.
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.340]   There must be some Hollywood listeners that
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.100]   can do this for us.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:18.900]   Yeah, we want movies to--
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.940]   I bet you we have some celebrities that listen to the show.
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.860]   Although folks at William Morris--
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.780]   Hi, this is Mike Ovets wishing you and all of yours
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.380]   a happy 100th.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.820]   Keep tweeting.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.100]   Maybe what we should do is I'll put a little bug--
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:33.580]   I'll do this.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:38.100]   I'll put a little recorder on twit.tv.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.860]   And so by the time you hear this,
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:42.420]   there will be on the front page at twit.tv,
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.620]   a little recording device.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.220]   So you can go there if you've got a microphone
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.260]   on your computer, record something.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.820]   If it doesn't sound good, I'm not going to use it.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.900]   And if you're famous, send me an email saying you did it
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.620]   so that I know.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.520]   Or you could send me an email with the audio attached.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.940]   That'd be OK to do as well.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.260]   Leo@twit.tv.
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:58.820]   And then maybe in our 100th anniversary--
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:59.980]   It's going to be so pathetic, John.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.020]   A lot of maybes here.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.340]   In our 100th anniversary show, we're
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.140]   going to have like four people.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.940]   Hi, this is Joe and Fremont.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.940]   I love Twent.
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:08.900]   Happy anniversary.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.020]   How about this Leo?
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.140]   Folks, what do you want us to do for the 100th episode?
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.140]   No, it's too late.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:14.660]   It's too late.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:15.420]   We can't ask him now.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.820]   We should ask him in '95 or '90.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.340]   You know what?
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.500]   You'll get the email Leo.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500]   In 1995, you'll get the email.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.960]   In '90, the whole five or six days to pull it together.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.400]   Well, because you've got two weeks,
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.080]   because I'm not going to be here next week.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:27.920]   We're going to do this.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920]   Yeah, see, we've got time.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.200]   Two weeks is forever in podcast.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.000]   Two weeks, we might not even be a show anymore.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.480]   John will have absorbed us into the Podshow Pod.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.120]   So it seems to take longer than that.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.480]   You'll be burping Twent for days.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.200]   All right, everybody.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.320]   Thank you so much, John C. Devorek at devorek.org/blog.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.120]   Patrick Norton at dl.tv.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:53.980]   And I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:54.820]   We'll see you next time.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.740]   Another Twent is in the can.
