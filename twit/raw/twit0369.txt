[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   This is "Twit."
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, a very good day to you.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   We take a moment out of our busy weeks to sit, ponder, to consider the implications of the tech news stories of the week.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   With our top notch pundits.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   Starting with to my left, Mark Millian, who is a...
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   What is your title? Writer, editor?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Writer, editor, editor.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   Writer, editor at Bloomberg Business Week, which is a fine magazine.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   Fine.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   Well, I was just thinking I should subscribe to this, actually.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   It's good to have you back, Mark.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   We first met Mark when he was at the LA Times in CNN.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   And now he's lighted.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   And you have Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   And you have an article in here about the CEO of...
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   What was the name of the company?
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   CTO of Shopkick.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   What's Shopkick?
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   It's a mobile rewards program.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   And there's some interesting technology behind it.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   This is a hot topic.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   A modem.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Using modem technology, it's a speaker at a store's entrance that the human ear cannot hear, but the smartphone can hear it.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   Wow.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   And so it knows which store you're in.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   Wow.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   GPS, not enough.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   GPS, not enough.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   If you're in a mall, how does it know if you're in the gap or the old Navy, two stores down?
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   Also here, John C. Devorek.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   From channeldevorek.com.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   I'm going to have you back, John.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Hello.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   And sitting in the chair where Joel Do-Dell would be perched...
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   The I-CEO.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   (LAUGHTER)
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   You know, I was thinking because we might have an...
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   This is the one that was banned, wasn't it?
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   No, no.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   This is from a throwboy, but it may have been banned because he doesn't have any more.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   So there's some question about whether he...
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   There's also the action figure.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   I think that was the one that was banned.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   This does look a little like Steve Jobs, but it could be anybody wearing a black belt.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   Nobody has the best choice of anybody wearing a black turtleneck jeans and...
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   Which is half the max...
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   Yeah, the owners in the world.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   It could be Johnny Ive.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   Anyway, Joel Lee is running late, but we'll get her in the studio soon.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   Actually, that is one of the top stories.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   It's going to be a crazy week.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   We've got coming up on September 5th.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   Nokia is going to make some announcements.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   Motorola, Google is going to make some announcements.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   Presumably, both of those will be new phones, although Nokia might do a Windows 8 tablet
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   on a Windows RT tablet.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   Then Amazon the next day, September 6th, has a New York City announcement presumed to be
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   the new Kindles.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   Or is that a guess or do we know?
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   Have they said they haven't said that?
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   They haven't said, but...
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   It seems...
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   Everybody's taking a page from Apple's book.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   It's a busy couple of weeks coming up, but nobody's received an invite yet to the Apple event.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   Am I right?
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   Correct.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   But the rumors are very strong that it's September 12th.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   That's about right.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   That means Monday or Tuesday, maybe Wednesday, we'll get invitations.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   Not me.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   It's been a week before.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   Some will get one.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   You'll get an invitation.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   Mark will get an invitation.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   He'll tell us.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   Yeah, because he hasn't...
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   Hasn't anything...
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   And he's got the ICO yet.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   And that's presumably a phone, although the pundits who seem best connected to Apple,
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   that would be John Gruber of Daring Fireball.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   He started it followed by John Pachowski at All Things D and confirmed by the legendary
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   Jim Dalrymple of the Loop.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   Yep.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   Yep.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   You know, this is emerged without my knowledge.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   This has happened.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.320]   Apparently, this guy, Jim Dalrymple, is so well connected that he doesn't repeat rumors.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   He confirms them.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.400]   But he's not really with Apple.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.440]   He's never been an Apple employee, but apparently he's just...
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440]   So in the past...
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   He's the editor of Macworld Magazine.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   He was there for a long time.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.360]   He's a very well source.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.480]   So Gruber writes an article saying, "I've been thinking..."
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   Which I find hard to believe.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.880]   It seems more like I got a phone call.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.480]   But anyway, I've been thinking.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.520]   Apple probably wouldn't announce a new iPad Mini at the same time as they announced a
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.600]   new iPhone because that would steal the iPhone's thunder.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   They'll have two events.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.080]   Is Dalrymple the guy with the Taliban beard?
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   Okay.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   He's either ZZ-topper.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.520]   Yeah, he does look a lot like ZZ-topper.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   He's got big...
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.520]   Well, he needs big sunglasses that would do it.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   It's a picture with...
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.560]   Of him is the most popular picture of him.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   I think it's his Twitter picture.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.440]   And I think it's the slash.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.760]   Or is it just slash?
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.760]   Slash or the slash?
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.480]   Well, he's on like a guitar guy?
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   No, the...
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.480]   I think it's slash.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.480]   Yes.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   Okay.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.480]   Glad we cleared that up.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   It looks like Leon Russell.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.480]   I completely lost my turn.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.680]   John Gruber says, "I've been thinking they're not going to have one event.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.240]   They're going to have two because why steal the thunder?"
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.720]   The next they'll announce an iPad Mini 7.85-inch iPad in October.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.640]   And Jim Dowlrimples' response is, "Gruber's a pretty smart guy."
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.120]   And then John Pachowski and all things D says, "Yep."
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.120]   Oh, God.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.120]   Really?
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120]   I didn't follow all this.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120]   Well, it's hard to follow.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.480]   I make a profession out of it.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.200]   Anyway, a lot of announcements will probably cover some of those live.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   You know, I have...
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.760]   Brian Hogg is making me a Tim Cook puppet.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   Puppet?
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   With the hand?
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.920]   You know, Apple no longer streams those events.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.680]   Oh, we can just do the thing with a bunch of puppets.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.160]   I would do a reenactment.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   Got the I.C.E.O.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.360]   We could just get a puppet of Tim Cook and we'd really be set.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   Don't you think?
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360]   I think it's a way to go.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   And we'll try to be a lot more entertaining.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.280]   We'll make a little mini stage with old curtains.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.440]   One of them will hold a stick.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.960]   What I'll do is I'll get, you know, because the Virgin and Gaj and everybody is live blogs
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.600]   and they put pictures up.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.360]   I'll just have a rear projection and we can put the pictures up as they come.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.280]   We can actually do a pretty decent re.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.960]   I want to put some energy into this.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.440]   It sounds like a pretty good recreation.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.680]   I think you hit the home run with this.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.480]   I don't want more from.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   It'd be good.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.560]   You got to make sure he's carrying around a Samsung phone.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   A little mini Samsung phone.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.400]   Oh, and that's speaking of which Samsung's back in court.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.040]   Now, as you know, last time we spoke, Samsung 101.05 billion dollar judgment against, I'm
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.320]   sorry, Apple 101.05 billion dollar judgment against Samsung and 24 of its phones.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   Samsung came back to court.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.240]   I wonder if that's Jolie.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:21.760]   Samsung came back to court on Friday and said, Oh, by the way, we'd like to add some more
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.120]   phones to the complaint.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.720]   Originally, Samsung had included the Galaxy S3 and some other more modern phones in the
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   lawsuit.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   Apple.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.800]   Do you understand why I'm confused?
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   It's ludicrous.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.240]   They're really the same.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   Apple on Samsung.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.080]   Well, you know, I wrote a column about this for PC Magazine that discussed that what I think
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.920]   was the big mistake that Apple's and the continuing mistake they're making, which is making the
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.880]   phones equivalent because now we're creating the psychological effect on the public at
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.160]   large that these two phones are the same indeed.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.960]   So why by the expensive?
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   By the expensive Apple phone instead by the cheap.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   I don't know.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.720]   It's exactly the same galaxy phone and save all this money.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.840]   And meanwhile, it cost them what so I don't even think they're ever going to pay the
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.880]   billion or whatever it is because there's all kinds of other things that are going on.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.560]   And we have to remember that half of the guts of the iPhone are made by Samsung, including
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.560]   the CPU.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.520]   So this is a joke this whole thing.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.120]   So apparently Apple has filed an amended complaint.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.520]   This is a separate case from the Apple Samsung case with the US District Court for Northern
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.640]   California.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.560]   They had already asked for patent infringement against the phone you're carrying, John the
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.560]   Nexus.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.400]   In fact, asked for anything like if iPhone do you see this is well, okay, let me I'll
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.760]   set this up and I'll say where my issues are.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.920]   And they've added to that complete the Galaxy S3, which I carry and the Galaxy Note, which
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.760]   I used to carry, which is 5.3 inches is ginormous.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.000]   And besides that, if this way to really look like an Apple phone, this should be scratched
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.160]   at craps as well as scratched at glass.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.960]   So these are the more recent phones.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now they had originally added at least some of those phones to the trial and judge Lucy
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.840]   coat that they just concluded and Lucy coast that you can't you can't do all of those.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   It's too much.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.120]   So they took the more recent phones out.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.680]   I was not too upset with the verdict because I thought the jury rightly concluded that Apple
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.360]   Samsung copied Apple intentionally.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.480]   They looked at the iPhone early on and their early Samsung Android phones for it looked
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.280]   very much like the iPhone.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.200]   And there was the, you know, the smoking gun emails from the Samsung executives that said
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.720]   we have a crisis of design.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.240]   We've got to respond to the iPhone.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.600]   I've just seen it and it's heaven versus the hell of our phones.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.160]   And I think the jury rightly concluded.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.760]   Yeah, Samsung said we're going to copy.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.160]   Well, they did with the white iconic against the black background.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.960]   It was the exact rip off.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.080]   But that's that was then now this is five years later and I think Samsung is really innovated.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.760]   I think the note is a good example.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.640]   For to me, it seems for Apple to include these to have a new suit against these new phones
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.720]   is not nearly so clear cut.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.120]   Yeah, it's not a strong argument.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.880]   I mean, the damages I think related mostly to the confusion.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880]   And there's no confusion, right?
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   Or you're not confused.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880]   Nobody's confused.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   We know what this phone is.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   It's a fairly shoes and car car.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880]   It's doesn't care.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.960]   But that was looking at earlier phones, not these current phones.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.320]   Now, the patents that Apple is going after Samsung now, these are the new ones.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:34.520]   They're six, four, seven, the data detectors patent, seven, two, one slide to unlock one
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.280]   seven, two word completion and six, oh, four universal search.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.040]   These were not word completion.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.280]   Yeah, huh, like T nine.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.840]   Didn't isn't that prior art?
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.560]   Yeah, it's old.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.080]   Mm.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.000]   So they're trying to get a sales ban against these products.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.520]   Twenty one new smartphones, media players and tablets that Samsung began releasing in
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.640]   August of last year through August of this year.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:12.480]   The Galaxy S3, the Galaxy Note, the Galaxy S2, the Epic 4G Touch Galaxy S2 that's on sprint.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.880]   The illusion, the captivate glide, these names,
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.920]   Terrible names, stratosphere, transform, ultra.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.040]   The latter ones are named by the carriers though.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   Oh, are they?
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040]   Okay.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   The wire naming convention.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   Conquer the dart.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.840]   Have you seen the art?
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.640]   You want to throw it at somebody?
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   It's made by Dodge.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.800]   The Android phones versus condom names.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   Yes.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   They do seem a little bit the excite.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   The excite's confusing.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.680]   Captivate, the fascinate, the excite.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:47.880]   The media players too, the Galaxy tab, which both the 10, one note and the tab seven plus
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   and the 8.9 inch tab, all of which the jury in the last case said, no, the tablet's done
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.040]   French.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.880]   So, Apple's not giving up.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.640]   And I think at this point it's going a little far.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.240]   I think it was not so bad that Apple won that case.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.240]   I think they'll settle.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   They can move forward.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.120]   But if Apple continues to put Samsung phones in the jeopardy, I'm not going to be happy
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.480]   because I like them.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   I want them.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.880]   Winning that case may have vindicated Apple and maybe now they'll go in a tear thinking
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.240]   that they have an argument.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   That's the word.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.800]   Well, you got to remember Apple's been a litigative company since the Apple two days since the
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.480]   pain Apple computer came out.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.480]   Since Windows.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.800]   Well, that Windows back back further.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.320]   1979, we're talking.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.120]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.680]   Well, he was exploring books.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.040]   But that's when they were they started suing people left away.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.640]   Franklin computer was damn near put out of it.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   That's right.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.480]   It was essentially by suit.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.840]   Good article in Tech Crunch.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.400]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.600]   I should have bookmarked it.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:56.320]   That I think does a good job of kind of breaking this down and acknowledges that Apple's been
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   wandering.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.320]   Here it is.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   It's from John Evans.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.640]   Apple's patent win is bad for all of us.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.800]   He says, "I can see why people who are Apple users during the dark days have a messianic
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.480]   zeal.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:17.520]   Their ultimate triumph after such long suffering at the brutal hands of inferiors like Microsoft
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.280]   might seem to them more than remarkable.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.820]   It might seem," and this is a good word, "righteous."
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.440]   Add that to one of the weirdest and most unexpected things about the 21st century, the
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.560]   extent to which so many people defensively identify with the operating system on their
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.480]   phone.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.480]   Before that on the computer.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   Right.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   We're the holy back.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480]   I'm a Mac person.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:45.760]   An Apple must seem like a living testament to the ultimate victory of truth, justice, and
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.760]   the American way.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.840]   That's great writing by the way.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.680]   But I think that that's a good point that there is a, you don't like it?
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   It's corny.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.960]   It's corny, but I like it.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.560]   So what he's saying is that Apple, it's understandable that people who have lived through the dark
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:08.240]   days of Apple teetering on the brink might have kind of a messianic zeal, a righteous
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.840]   indignation about what Samsung's doing that isn't really justified.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.720]   Do you know anybody that's righteously indignant about this personally?
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.720]   No.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   I don't either.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   But I live in a bubble.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.880]   Well, you run into a lot of people.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.880]   You go to the Mac world conference.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.680]   I've never run into anybody that's upset about it.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:34.400]   In fact, when I take one of these Nexus phones in, I'm always going on and on about the fact
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.200]   that never gets scratched ever, and they say, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.200]   Nobody cares.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.440]   I was standing around with a bunch of teenagers last time.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.160]   My son had his 18th birthday party.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.160]   Okay.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.640]   And I was standing at the front door guarding it, trying to keep people out and keep the
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.720]   drunks from driving home.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.360]   And I was standing with a gaggle of teenagers and one of the girls had her iPhone and dropped
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   it.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.920]   You know, it's slippery.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.920]   It's said people would drop them and bite them.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.480]   And she went, oh, I cracked it.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.920]   One of my parents going to say, and then every one of them said, oh, yeah, they all pulled
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.520]   out their cracked iPhones.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520]   Every one of them.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.520]   It's amazing.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.520]   It's pretty good.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   So far.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.520]   I've had it for almost two years.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.520]   No, and you're careful.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.520]   How is it that you've not cracked your iPhone?
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.160]   Do you have a case?
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   You don't have a case.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.160]   No, use a case.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.160]   So that was the thing.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.160]   She didn't have a case.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.760]   I thought, well, what, you know, if you have an iPhone, shouldn't you have it in some
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   sort of bulletproof?
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.160]   I don't know what is with these kids dropping their iPhones left and right.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160]   Drinkers.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   I think that's what it is.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160]   There are a bunch of Apple.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.160]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.160]   The back and front.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   Look, as Steve Martin once told me, I like the iPhone as a great phone.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   You're always dropping his name.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   You never can be.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.920]   Hey, wouldn't you?
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   My buddy Steve.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.120]   My buddy Steve told me.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.960]   He said Apple, the iPhone with the iPhone is they took a great phone and they made it at,
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.280]   then they made it out of glass and slippery.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.720]   You can't deny that.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   I guess.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   You can't.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.680]   There's sure a lot of people that break them.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.120]   The rumors that they're going back to metal on the back, right?
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.120]   Right.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.880]   Which will, by the way, break the NFC.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.720]   So now they're going to do it.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   What do you think I CEO?
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.960]   Well, the way I see it, we've got plenty of things to do.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.320]   The other things to worry about besides these little petty grievances.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   Doing impression of you.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   Get back to work.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.120]   It sounds just like him.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.640]   Get back to work.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.160]   Get back to work.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.800]   The other rumor was that Apple will not be doing NFC, which is kind of disappointing to
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.920]   me because he wouldn't make the back metal if you were going to do NFC.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.520]   It doesn't work through metal.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.160]   This has NFC.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.680]   But it's a, you know, all with Samsung phones, it's got that cheesy plastic back.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   So this phone has an NFC.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.440]   And you know where they put the NFC, and this is clever.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.960]   They put it in the battery so you can't use some cheapy third party battery.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   Was that right?
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.680]   There's probably other good reasons.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   NFC is a.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.320]   Well, it's a passive technology, but they have to have power in the, they use inductive
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.560]   power to get the passive chip to read.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.760]   So they need quite a bit of power.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.520]   So maybe it makes sense to put it in the battery.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.120]   Do you use Google Wallet?
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.680]   Google Wallet does not work on my phone as it does not work on many.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   Yes.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.680]   It's a Verizon.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.840]   No, it's an unlocked European Galaxy S3.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.560]   And still it says wallet is not available.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.440]   So I thought, no, that's an S3 issue.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440]   But then somebody emailed me.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.680]   You know, my T-Mobile S3 it works on.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.480]   So it's maybe carrier.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.480]   And sprint.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.480]   That one's an 18T.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   That one's an 18T.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   Maybe it's sprint.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   Maybe it was sprint.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480]   He said, yeah.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.280]   Well, that's a great idea because Google has now allowed you to add all your credit cards,
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   right?
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   Took a little while, but yeah.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.760]   But that's just recently.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.480]   So now if I get somewhere with an NFC chip, of which there are very few.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.440]   Well, actually, I see the terminals around quite a bit.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.920]   I have the American Express card that has a chip on it that I use sometimes.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.520]   But it's, I don't think to use it.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.080]   I just swipe.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.040]   I saw an interesting, now you just talked about Shop Kick.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.600]   I saw a new chatroom.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:15.240]   Do you remember we were talking about it during the radio show, a new product, Android
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:22.160]   product for shoppers that you tap, instead of tapping to pay, you tap to get a receipt.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.600]   And your phone is copying information about stuff you buy as you walk around.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   That sounds right.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.920]   I think that's a very, I don't know.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.360]   Would that be compelling?
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:37.120]   Also offers, which of course, I'm sure Shop Kick wants to do offers because that's where
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.120]   the money is, right?
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   You walk into a store.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.120]   You walk into a store.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.200]   Do you hear that magic tone?
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   Was it Proximient?
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.720]   You got 32 gigabytes on this little big car.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   No, it's an amazing.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.520]   So let me show you this at Proximient.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.160]   Touch and go digital receipts.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.920]   So this is another way you could use NFC that's kind of...
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.120]   This is all a scam.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   What?
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.240]   This is the worst thing we should be doing is any of this NFC stuff, especially for security
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   reasons.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:06.720]   No, because this is going to be the phone company in charge of our personal debt debts.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.200]   And so they can, in the olden days, you might have some charge or something with American
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.680]   experts and we don't want to pay it.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.160]   Okay, well, it's up for grabs.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.320]   Well, in this case though, John, it's not the phone company, it's Google.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.800]   No, I know, but it's going to end up with the phone company.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   You watch.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   I guarantee it.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.560]   That's what ISIS is about.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.720]   The phone company is controlling the payments.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.560]   No, I think it's going to be Apple and Google.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.560]   Apple's certainly going to control the iPhone.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.560]   They're not going to be in this business.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.160]   Well, Google doesn't do any of the payment stuff.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.160]   They have master cards.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   No, no, I understand.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.280]   But you're not going through your phone carrier when you're using Google Wall.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.960]   You're going through Google, right?
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.160]   It's not going to be where it's going to be.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.160]   Where's it going to be?
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.160]   How's it going to be built out?
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.000]   Is it going to be built out on your phone or not?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.320]   Currently it's built out on your credit card through Google Wall.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   That's fine.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.120]   If the device is on your phone bill.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   Right.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.720]   But that's not going to take off because neither Google nor Apple wants that.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.360]   Most companies very much want to take care of all the traffic, right?
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.760]   Well, there's a lot of money in there.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.760]   There's a lot of money in there.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.360]   You just pulled everything out of my phone.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   It's OK.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.360]   It's back together.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.360]   I didn't change the degree.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.360]   That's amazing.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.920]   God, it's like field stripping my phone during the show.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.440]   Stripping it for parts.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.280]   While you're in there, would you mind cleaning it a little bit?
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.280]   Maybe you lick it.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.480]   Yeah, I think it's some valuable swabbing there.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   So this Proximian lets you get receipts beamed to your smartphone without having to share
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.120]   your personal information with the store.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.280]   You can manage your spending when you have a return.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.160]   You've got a barcode on the phone for that receipt.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.040]   So you don't need to bring your receipt with you to scan it.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.360]   They collate the information and they have, and this is, of course, the key rewards.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.400]   Cute girl in the demo video.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.600]   And a cute girl in the demo video.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.000]   Thank you for Mark for saying that.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.320]   So I didn't have to.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.280]   So do you actually use this?
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.280]   I could.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   I don't.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.280]   Why?
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.160]   Because not a single merchant in town supports it.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.400]   Nobody supports it.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   Is there any NFC applications you use with your phone?
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.160]   Yeah, when you come in here, there's a little NFC chip on the wall.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.240]   If you tap that, I'll check in on four square.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   Okay.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   That's cool.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.680]   Yeah, it's a demo.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   You need to download it.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.840]   But if you don't have an account on four square, then it won't do nothing.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.320]   Well, that's more like it.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.360]   I have my NFC turned off.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.480]   I refuse to have something like that turned on, basically creating a beacon wherever I go.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.200]   No, because it's within a few inches.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   You can't stop.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.200]   It's not beaconing.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.200]   It has to be.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.520]   They have these demos every once in a while.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.920]   That's RFID.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.280]   And this is not that much different.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.280]   This is very different.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   It's an RFID that's specifically designed to be short-range because it needs inductance
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.360]   from a power source to do it.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.720]   So does the thing I use to go across the bridge?
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.440]   It doesn't got a battery in it.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   No, that's true.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.840]   And things a mile away from the thing.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.960]   This is supposedly designed to avoid that for security reasons.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   Oh, God.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.800]   And you can already see the problem here.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.680]   If you want to believe these stories, that's fine with me.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.360]   I'm a true believer.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.560]   So Apple doing NFC, do you think it's going to happen?
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.320]   No, that's what's a surprise to me because it would make a huge difference if Apple did.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.760]   I think it would give a critical mass.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.760]   But no merchant.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.400]   See, this is the power of the iPhone.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   If you're-- I'm looking here.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.240]   We're in Main Street, USA, right here.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   Pretty much.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.080]   You go down to Kentucky Street and unless those merchants all have NFC terminals of some
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.000]   kind, nobody's going to do it.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Now if Apple did it--
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   A guy.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.800]   And everybody walking around with an iPhone had that capability.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.800]   Not the way it works.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   That's not the way it works.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.000]   Some guy from out of town will come in here, some slicker.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Carbon beggar.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   City slicker.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.800]   And he's going to be going from store to store to store showing these people why they should
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.100]   have this.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.100]   And then he's going to be walking away with a--
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   It's like the music man.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.100]   With a bunch of money.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   A big handful of money.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.820]   A company like Google, which has already come in to some merchants and said, "We'll install
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.800]   these terminals if you put a little ad for Google Wallet on them."
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   Right.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   That's what it says.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.680]   If I go to Pete's Coffee right now, it says Google Wallet.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680]   That's the one store in town.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   I think I can use it.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.680]   Now then there's the other one.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.560]   There's geo-affencing, which Pay with Square uses.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.280]   Which kills the battery.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.280]   Oh, does it?
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.280]   What is this?
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.600]   So it's a feature in Pay with Square where you can turn it on for select merchants.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.140]   If you go nearby, it automatically checks your phone.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.980]   It's kind of embarrassing because I did have that--
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.840]   It's embarrassing because I did have that turned on and there's a coffee store just like
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   a couple of blocks here.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.920]   And it's always on because I'm always here.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.640]   So I had to turn that off.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.480]   So was everybody going in pain with Leo?
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   Just say I'm Leo.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.480]   Not with a tab.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   Put it on Leo's tab.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480]   That's a good idea.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.620]   Now there's some-- that's an advantage.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:38.080]   So it does geo-fencing, but the problem is if you're nearby, you know, it's-- I think
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.320]   the sound, the tone is an interesting response to that.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   Shopkit.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   That's cool.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.120]   It's just the problem is you got to get critical mass for anything to work, right?
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.040]   Because no merchant's going to put Google Wallet, Proximient, and Shopkit in their store.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.040]   Or are they?
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.800]   Well, I think NFC being a standard, it's already started to take off.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.640]   I get it, you know, 7-Eleven and McDonald's.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.920]   Well, I had kind of agreed that.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.080]   I don't think you need to put all of them.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.200]   I think it's almost like going to the ATM.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.520]   You got the Star Network, all these different networks that read your card.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.440]   It says it on the back of your card, which ones they go for.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:20.040]   And I think there'll just be a bunch of these networks that consolidate the pipe, but they
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.000]   still compete with each other.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.200]   I just like the idea of getting rid of the wallet, getting rid of money.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.800]   Surely you want to get rid of money.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   No.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   Why not?
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.840]   What, do you want to go back to the gold standard?
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840]   No, I'm not.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   The gold standard.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840]   Yeah, let me take this gold coin action.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.360]   I would like to give it to you.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.520]   I like this species.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.200]   I think it's a very wise way to go.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.960]   I think it's a very modern thing to do.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960]   What?
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   Species?
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.120]   Species, what's called a billion-
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.560]   That's called a species?
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.560]   Species.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.560]   Not like species like Darwin or species.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.560]   No, no, that's species.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   Or is it a species?
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   It's SP.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.720]   I think it's SPC IES.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.840]   And it means dollar bill.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.840]   It means bill.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   It means...
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.160]   Like in Dizzyia means a standard.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.520]   You know what this means.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.160]   I never heard the term.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.880]   Is it a term of art or is it just something you made up?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   It means money.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.960]   It means money.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.760]   So you like species?
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.760]   I do.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.520]   It can't be spelled the same as species.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.520]   Maybe I'll take the E out.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.120]   Well, probably there's some spelling.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   I can't find it.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.040]   Well, anyway, it's what it's called.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.720]   So you can look it up later.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.520]   I'll look it up while we're doing the show.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.600]   But anyway, the thing is I like printed money.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.800]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.520]   And you can control the economy a little bit.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.080]   I think it does work despite what everybody else thinks.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.080]   Money.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   You like dollar bills.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   You like pennies.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   You like nickels.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   You like the pie.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   You like quarters.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   What's wrong with that?
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   I don't want to carry it away.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.080]   But I want to walk...
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.240]   I want to make everything you buy tracked by some horrible people.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.320]   Oh, so what you like about money is it's anonymous.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   It's a nice thing.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   It's fine.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   It's the only good thing.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.400]   It's a disease carrier.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.160]   I have never really caught anything from money.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.520]   I don't eat my money.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.960]   No, but it's filthy.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.760]   I wash my hands.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   I mean, I'm not...
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.320]   So I can take a dollar and buy a dollar.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   What difference does it make?
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.120]   The epidermis is pretty good at protecting you from all the evil germs on dollar bills.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.760]   Well, you just better hope you don't get a tiny paper cut from all that paper money
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.760]   you're carrying.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.240]   You take it into another species.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.920]   The chatroom's saying I'm fighting a losing battle with me.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.440]   So it's more than anonymity.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.240]   You just like it.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.200]   What if you could just walk in and they'd say, "John, that's great.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.480]   It's on your bill."
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.720]   You don't want to be tracked.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.120]   So what if they track you?
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.120]   You not use credit cards?
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120]   I generally speak...
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   Well, here's the problem with them.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.600]   They have a high interest rate.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.120]   They have scam charges that constantly never end.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.800]   This happens with everything outside of straight up cash.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.920]   Just nickel and dime you to death with fees and charges and bogus charges that you have
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.160]   to fight and then you have cascade effect when all of a sudden you get overdrawn when
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.840]   you're really shouldn't have been because of something or other.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   So like at the...
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.040]   It's a whole banking system.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   Stinks.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   Should we go back?
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.240]   Should I pay my employees with a pay packet with some bills in it?
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.480]   That would be cool.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:17.440]   I could have a little window over here with a screen over it and a guy with a garter
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.360]   belt, a sleeve garters and a little shade.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.320]   John Slanina, let me look you up.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.880]   Fifty three dollars and six cents.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.320]   Don't spend it all at the bar.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   I'll pay them on Fridays.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.800]   Oh, then I can have a company store.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   I could pay them to scratch.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.640]   Well, this is where you headed anyway.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   I know.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.000]   Here's some endangered species money.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.140]   Is it a species...
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.140]   Species?
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.880]   Yeah, SPEC IES.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.400]   All right.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.440]   Which is unfortunately refers to the...
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.520]   By the way, I use credit cards by pay them off right away.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.160]   I never carry a chart because I don't want to pay the interest.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.240]   And so I find it convenient.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.480]   And I like the idea of a wallet because I like the idea I've got this with me.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.640]   I don't want to carry a wallet anymore.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.400]   I just want to carry this.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.680]   Wave it at people.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.440]   Species, SPEC IES.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.520]   That's what it is.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.680]   And it's also referred to as fiat money.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.240]   Oh, because it's not...
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.400]   It doesn't have any real value like gold.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.320]   You trust that somebody's going to steal faith and credit.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.920]   Yeah, you put the credit and faith of the...
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   Here you are.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.920]   Now, this is a classic.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.920]   You've got your credit card.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.320]   You're a big fan of this kind of thing.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   Let the banks follow me around.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.200]   But heaven forbid, I should trust the US government to back the dollar bill that's printed on
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.480]   this piece of paper.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.240]   That's exactly where you're coming from when you say these things.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.920]   You say this, "Okay, I'm saluting to the bank and the credit cards."
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.560]   But oh, this dirty money has got...
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   It's convenient.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.560]   It's convenient for me.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.560]   I don't have to carry cash around.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.920]   It's not the term or it can be in dropping a hundred bucks on someone.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.080]   Do you use an ATM machine?
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.320]   Which again has turned out to...
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.840]   Except for the fact that I go over the mechanics bank.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.880]   Which is a little banking operation that they pick up all the fees.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.880]   That's nice.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   Yeah, so I can go anywhere in the world.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.380]   That's only in San Francisco, though.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.380]   No.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.380]   No, the bank.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.380]   Yeah, the bank's only Bay Area.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.380]   Yeah, it's very bad.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.380]   But I can use a card.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.380]   I can use it anyway.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.380]   In France.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.880]   And it says, "Oh, you're not to pay 15 euros to use...
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.840]   But the mechanics bank says, "I will take care of that."
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.000]   So I use it and I grab a bunch of money and I'm on my way.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   So you...
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.560]   Oh, you want to have a wad.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   You like having a wad?
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   I don't have a wad.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.560]   No, I...
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.560]   You carried...
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.560]   Do you have a bank, a money clip?
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   You use the purple rubber band that comes on broccoli and then everyone thinks...
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.000]   That's the one you use.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.120]   Because that's the indicator that you're somehow mobbed up.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.080]   You're such an old man.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.080]   I'm an old man.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.080]   I'm the same age as you.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.080]   I know, I know.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.840]   But something went wrong.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.800]   No, nothing went wrong.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.560]   Something went wrong with you to trust the banks to such an extreme.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   It's convenience.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.360]   Oh, that's it.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.720]   So if I use broccoli rubber band, I'm mobbed up.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.800]   That's what it's going to look like.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   Yeah, so it's a recipe.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.120]   It has to be big enough to choke a horse though, right?
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.440]   I don't carry a big round wad.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.560]   I carry around $100 maybe.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   I got the...
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.560]   I got the debit card.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.920]   I can always get the money if I need it.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.880]   That wouldn't mind any kind of cool.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.360]   You think if you saw somebody walking around with a big wad of money and he peels off
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.680]   bills with his rubber band from broccoli.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   Broccoli.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.120]   And it's got to be the purple one, not the yellow.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.120]   Does that mean organic or inorganic?
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.280]   I don't know what it means.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.080]   I'm just telling you, it's a purple one you want.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.920]   I've noted, I say, whenever I get broccoli, I know they have a big strong rubber band
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   on there.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   I think geez, there should be some use for this.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   Now I know.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   It's exactly what it used for.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   I'm going to start calling...
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.720]   I used to call money cabbage.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.160]   I'm going to start calling it broccoli.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160]   You can do that.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160]   We're going to take a break.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   I'm going to make some garbage.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   Thank God.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   Where's Jolio Dell?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.360]   I'm telling you, she never confirmed it.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   We've been around Australia.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.080]   We need somebody to break this up.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.960]   Yeah, she'd do it.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.160]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.360]   We love Citrix and we really love GoToAssist.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.880]   If you're in the IT business and you do support, you're going to love GoToAssist.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.360]   I was talking to Russell because he uses a very much more expensive product to do something
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.840]   similar and he's ready.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.520]   He says, "I'm ready to go.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.880]   This thing is so much better and it's so much less expensive."
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   So what is it?
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.920]   Well, it's remote support.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   You know that already.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   I talked about GoToAssist before.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.480]   In fact, it's the number one market leader in remote support.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.560]   It gives you unattended access to your customer's computer so you can get in there and fix it.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.480]   So much easier than being on the phone and saying, "Okay, click the start menu.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.480]   There's no start menu.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.480]   It's Windows 8.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.120]   Okay, click the Windows button.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.120]   Okay.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   No, much better.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   Just go in there and fix it.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:49.520]   Mac or PC is very fast, very easy to use.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.960]   And now they've added something brand new that I think makes this a full support package.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.080]   They've got remote monitoring.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.000]   So I want you to try it and see how the monitoring works for you.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.840]   So the whole idea is you'll run the GoToAssist's crawler on your client network.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.400]   So Russell ran it on our network here, made a list of everything running on the network,
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:16.360]   all the hardware, all the software, every program on the system, everything.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.760]   Now he's got this database and now he can set up a dashboard that tracks the performance
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.080]   of everything, whether the toner cartridge is running low, the hard drive is running
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.040]   out of space, the network performance has gone down, servers or anything that happens.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:35.360]   He'll set the thresholds and he'll get an instant message or a text or an email when
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.920]   something's going wrong, he can get in there and fix it.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.360]   Now there's some kinds of support guys who like it when things go wrong and then they
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.320]   come in and fix it because it makes them look like a big man.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.200]   If you're not that kind of person, if really if you're a good support person, your goal
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.840]   is to make it transparent.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.840]   That's what Russell is.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.840]   Nothing ever goes wrong around here.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.640]   It's always working because he's proactive and that's what GoToAssist will do for you.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.280]   If you want to get in the managed support business, if you're already in the managed
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:10.840]   support business and you want to know more, visit GoToAssist.com, G-O-T-O-A-S-S-I-S-T.com.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.520]   There's a try it free button there.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.360]   Click that.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.520]   And use the promo code TWIT.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.520]   Right there with says promo code.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   There's a link.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.080]   You have to open it up and type in TWIT and 30 days free.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.960]   Both the remote monitoring and the remote support.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.760]   Make sure you check both because you may have already tried the remote support which is
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.880]   fantastic but you've got to try the monitoring as well.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.560]   Inventory management network tracker, tracking server, health monitoring, all of it.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.720]   Windows and Mac.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.960]   GoToAssist and Android and by the way you can do support from an iPad.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.520]   Go toassist.com.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.880]   Click the try it free button and use the promo code TWIT.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.680]   We thank Citrix for not only making great products but for their support for many years
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.480]   now of the TWIT network.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.400]   So we've seen, I don't know whether, you know, it's interesting.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.280]   When you don't, when you do the Apple thing where you have these announcements but you
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.160]   don't tell anybody ahead of time what the announcement is going to be.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:18.480]   You end up getting this Apple thing which is the rumors and the Verge has this, the picture.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.040]   The Verge.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.720]   I like the Verge.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   Do you not like the name or you're mocking the name or the company?
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.200]   They just appeared out of the blue it seems to me.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.720]   They did and they're doing, to me they're doing the best work out there.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.200]   Their coverage of the Samsung Apple trial was amazing.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.680]   Don't you think?
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.240]   Yeah, I'm not saying they're crap.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   It's like where they come from.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.240]   You got a Neelai Patel on your screen.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.040]   You got Joshua Topolsky.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.640]   You got Neelai Patel.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.040]   You got a really good team.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   And you know who it is?
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.200]   It's this SB Nation people.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   Vox.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   Oh, Vox.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   Do you know about them?
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   Yeah, kinda.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.680]   I think that, I don't know who's behind it but these guys seem like they know what they're
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.760]   doing.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.200]   They started with a sports network SB Nation.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.480]   They just did the Verge and they put a lot of money until they spent a year.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.800]   I remember Joshua and Neelai talking for like a year after they left Engadgment.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.120]   They said we got something good, something good's coming.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.720]   Wasn't this, is this is my next?
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.440]   Remember that where they did that for a while?
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.200]   And then the Verge appears and it was like wow, this is like full blown out of the mouth
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   of Zeus.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.840]   Slick is the word.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.840]   Very slick.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.880]   And they're gonna do the same thing with gaming.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.080]   They've got a new gaming product that they're gonna do.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   Yeah, what is that?
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.080]   Pixel.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.800]   It's a second coming of what's his name, the Gogger guy.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.560]   You think Nick Denton kind of, it's a bit false?
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   It feels like it.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   It's I think it's a.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.200]   No, but there's a guy behind SB, behind Vox.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.680]   It's not.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.320]   So, Laganita just makes the best beer on the West Coast.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.280]   I'm now convinced of it.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.800]   This is a local Petaluma brand.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.040]   Oh, you could have brought me one.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.560]   Go ahead and get one.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   There's one left.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.040]   I won't take the last beer.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.320]   Hey, hey, Burke, you got tons of Laganita's for.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.000]   Yeah, it's in the bottom.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.080]   And refrigerator number six on the bottom.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.240]   Don't go in the walk in because that's where I keep my meat.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.520]   You want to go, it's to the left of that.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.520]   Oh, Leo keeps his meat.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.520]   Well, I got to age it.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.240]   And we got the nice market steaks.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.240]   Very good.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.320]   But they got to age a little bit.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   So we have a little, we have a special meat locker.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.320]   That's just.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.840]   You should start buying your meat off the hoof.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.440]   Seriously, it's what I do.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.680]   I could put it in the basement.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.880]   Is that a butcher term off the hoof?
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   Kind of.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880]   They're used to it.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   There's a little.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   Is it polygon?
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   What is it?
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.480]   So they haven't started yet, but they're.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.800]   I think they have a section on the verge now.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   And they'll all just stand on site.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   That's right.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.960]   But I think they hired a bunch of people from IGN.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   A lot of the big gaming sites.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.800]   A guy I used to work with Russ Pitts is going to be over there too.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.240]   And he's a very good writer.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.240]   Very interesting.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.360]   So what were we talking about?
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.360]   Kindle Fire.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   The Verge has the story.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.920]   This is their picture of the Verge's obtained images of what appear to be the next version of
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.240]   the Kindle Fire.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.040]   The Fire is sold out.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.160]   Was sold out this week.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.960]   You couldn't go to Amazon and buy it.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.040]   That means they got something else.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:18.920]   They're saying 7 and 10 inch.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   This looks like a 7 inch just from the picture.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.360]   It looks like it's a little bit smaller than the.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.480]   Look at this picture though.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   This mockup.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.480]   It looks like junk.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   I don't even know.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   It doesn't look good.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   But the Kindle Fire was kind of junky.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   Wasn't it?
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   Well, yeah.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   It was 200 bucks.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.440]   What's interesting is the world has changed.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.120]   You could get this now in this Nexus 7, which is not, by any means junk.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.840]   He's same price, 200 bucks.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.840]   In no sense does it feel junky, right?
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:52.040]   So I think, and I could tell you what, if Apple's doing a mini and I bet you, here's
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   my prediction.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040]   I'll be the first to say this.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.320]   Apple's going to sell it for 200 bucks.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.440]   They're not going to do the normal.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   249.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.240]   Well, it might be 240.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   Nah.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   Slide prediction.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   But I bet you starts at 200.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.240]   With gutless.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.120]   Yeah, the one you want will be 249.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   That could be.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   I'm not going to make that bet.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.920]   In either case, though, it means that Apple's being extraordinarily aggressive, right?
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.840]   Why are you reaching over and touching his machine?
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.040]   Oh, wait a minute, because it has a keyboard.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.560]   It actually is not just--
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.520]   He's got the story open.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.360]   He would have done that if he could.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.360]   So there's an update.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.000]   They say this is not the picture.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.160]   Though we know this image originated to the Amazon, another source adds the following.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.600]   That picture you guys posted, not the new Kindle Fire.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.600]   I know.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   It's Bogative.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.800]   I've held the new Kindle Fire in my hand.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   Oh, please.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.040]   And I have played with it for extensive periods of time.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.040]   Yeah, I've heard these stories.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.040]   The bezel is wider.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.320]   It has sloping sides like the zoom.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   It also sits nicely in the hand.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.840]   Well, this is just a bit of prototype.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.720]   A mockup of the software, I thought.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:56.560]   I mean, the software is something I don't know if I buy that mockup.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.640]   Well, yeah, and I wasn't real thrilled, frankly, with Amazon's version of an Android.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.560]   And I think that one of the things that really sells the Nexus is that it's jelly bean.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   It's pure.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   It's a pure Android experience.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   And butter.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   And butter.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.640]   And I have to say, I like Android.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.320]   I've always liked Android, but I think Android now is really--
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.880]   It's like nicely done.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.880]   --buttery.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.800]   And you say that I configure it like crazy, but it's true because that's one of the things
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   I like about it.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   You're just out of control.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   You should probably sell that configuration.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   You could probably get a dollar.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   It's the Leo setup.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.140]   It's a mess.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.080]   It's got a few widgets.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.520]   Oh, it's a whole thing.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.520]   It's unbelievable.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.280]   It's like-- so that's my music page.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280]   That's my news information.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.280]   That's Flipboard.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.080]   Don't blame me.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.520]   That's just Flip-- don't zoom in on that.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.400]   This is good for SEO.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.160]   So that's my information page.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.760]   This is my calendar and to-do list with a few little extra icons.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.160]   That's my home page with the time, the weather, and the icons I use a lot.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.760]   And then I have fishes.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.760]   See the little fishes?
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.320]   These chats going on.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.320]   You got--
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.320]   See the little fishes.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.320]   It's outrageous.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.840]   You can't do that on an iPhone.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.200]   I can feed the fishes, too, if I tell you.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   We should get back to the show.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   I do this every time.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   You do that on Windows 95.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.360]   It's like Windows 95.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.760]   Here's my home page.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   What's your home page?
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.600]   That's kind of clean, Mr. Devorak.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.760]   I'll tell you why I don't like stock ice cream sandwich.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.480]   You can't get rid of the Google search bar, waste of space.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.520]   The buttons are on the screen.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.240]   They're not on the phone, right?
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.080]   So this is a waste of space.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   So even though it has a nice big screen--
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   Next one, on the phone, too.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   A whole bunch of it.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.080]   Are there buttons below?
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.080]   I don't know.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.080]   Maybe not.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   No, they got rid of them.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   Remember, this is the key.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.920]   The whole thing with ice cream sandwich was the buttons.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.920]   And I don't like that because it means the menu could be up there, it could be over here,
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   it could be up and down.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.720]   I'm not crazy about it.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.640]   He wants his phone back because he knows if I have it too long, I'll change it to Greek.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.440]   You have to do the show, you don't have time to change it to Greek.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.880]   You're right.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:09.040]   Also, and I am excited about this, if it's true, again, rumor, again from the Verge, Amazon's
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   going to do a new eink Kindle.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.280]   They're calling it Paperwhite.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.840]   This was always the disappointment of the Kindle, was it wasn't really high contrast.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.080]   I kind of have a gray, green background.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.680]   It's not bad to current one.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   It's OK.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.080]   But wouldn't it be nice to have a-- were like paper?
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   That's the goal list.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   Black text.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.080]   Just like this.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   That's blue.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.080]   Oh.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.200]   That's what I want.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.240]   No, I want a hike.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.440]   I want to look like a book.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.080]   The more it looks like a book, the better.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.200]   Well, so these things are taking over the world.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.080]   So I was down in LA and it went over to Pornell's place and we chatted about it.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   Oh, did you?
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080]   Oh, we should have forget Jolio, Del.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   We should have Jerry here.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.080]   We could have.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.080]   Yeah, in fact, he said to me, he says, "John, how come you're not getting me on the Leo
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   show board?"
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.880]   He said, "Chad, to contact Mr. Pornell a while ago."
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.440]   And I said, "I think it's a mistake."
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.440]   It's an oversight.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   He's a love Jerry.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.280]   So he says that because he's doing his agent apparently, he's moved all his old stuff to
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.400]   Kindle and he's been very happy with it.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:16.080]   He says that-- and my son agrees with this because he's done some research-- a Kindle's
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:26.000]   accounting for about 85 to 90% of all book sales with 5 to 10% nook and then the rest
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.240]   scattered around of these things.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.200]   I mean, people aren't buying paper at all.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.840]   Well, no, I'm talking about the eBooks.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   All the eBooks.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.240]   So in other words, the iPad and all the rest of them are just less than 10%.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.120]   Yeah, the iPad is not a reading experience in the same way the Kindle is.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.120]   It's--
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.640]   Plus you could also buy on the Kindle store and iPad and have--
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   That's a good point.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   Access from any device.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   That's probably why, right?
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   Because if you buy it once on a Kindle--
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.640]   Who reads on it?
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   Does anybody read on it?
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.640]   Do you read books on an iPad?
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   No, I have a Kindle.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   Most people are like you.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.640]   They have a Kindle.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   I think so.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.640]   But do people really want two devices?
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.640]   One for reading and one for--
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.640]   You guys can't?
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.640]   He's got two.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.640]   I do.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   Do you?
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   I use Insta paper on the Kindle.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.640]   Well, that's interesting because the emails you once a week at emails do your articles.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.640]   That's nice.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.640]   After staring at a screen all day, what's it called?
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   Insta paper.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   Insta paper.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   Yeah, I've heard it just--
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   Yeah, yeah, you've got to have it.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.640]   But there's a lot of them.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.080]   There's a pocket now which replaced ReadIt later.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.080]   And Apple has its own--
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.080]   Readability.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.800]   Readability, yeah.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.280]   I like readability.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.280]   Anyway.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   This is a big deal.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.640]   This is a radical change from the--
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.640]   But you're both of your writers.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.160]   And one of the complaints that a lot of people have against all of these is that they're
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.560]   kind of taking money out of your pocket.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.640]   The complaint that a number of--
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.160]   I keep my money wrapped up in a purple rubber band.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.720]   Then you can't take it because it would choke a horse.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.200]   One of the-- I can't remember who was complaining.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:55.440]   It was a grouber that the problem with these apps is they strip out the ads basically.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.240]   They take the content.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.920]   You never see the ad.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.400]   You never see how it's supposed to be.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.400]   You're stealing.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.880]   The advertiser doesn't know.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.720]   It still counts as a hit on the page.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.600]   So that's OK then.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.400]   You're stealing from the advertiser not to--
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.400]   Yeah, that's a ticket.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.400]   That's all right.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.640]   I think I have money to burn.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.640]   Speaking of which, let's talk--
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.880]   There you-- it's all factored in, Leo.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.880]   It's all factored in.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.640]   That's why when you buy a twit, you get your money's worth.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.400]   Because there's no way that you could strip the ads out of a twit.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.280]   Not somebody can do it by hand.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   That's a challenge.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   But then the show would be old.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.280]   They're so tightly integrated.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.640]   And for instance, this fine ad for Lagoonita's Pale Ale.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.240]   You couldn't really get rid of that because that's part of the show.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.480]   You know, this Pale Ale is not bad.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.320]   You usually have the IPA, which is--
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.320]   The IPA is excellent.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.000]   And then I think you want the something-something.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.560]   Here, let's put it right here so we can see it.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.880]   It's a fine beer.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.760]   Let's give it a little bit to the casing.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.080]   I see, yeah.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.840]   Oh, man, man, man, man.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.200]   Rich is great stuff.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.680]   Our show brought to work on that job's impression.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.200]   It's not good.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.200]   Doesn't sound like him?
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.000]   No.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.280]   I rented the movie that Cringley found in his garage.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.440]   Oh, I saw that in the theater.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.920]   Yeah, people-- yeah, that was weird.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.680]   So job's dies.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.320]   And like within a month, Cringley finds the lost interview, which
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   is like a 90-minute interview with Steve Jobs that he did 25 years ago.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.960]   It was in the 1995, I think.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.760]   That's the one where--
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.040]   The director put it in his garage and never looked at it again.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.640]   They found it.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.960]   But it was worth seeing.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.880]   It's on iTunes now, and I rented it.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.960]   And it was actually worth seeing.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:32.640]   It was an interesting--
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.400]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.960]   Jobs is uncharacteristically outspoken.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.520]   He talks a lot about Microsoft.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.480]   Yeah, and I'll build this--
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.680]   Trash, no taste.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.720]   Yeah, trash talk.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.600]   Yeah, we saw the best part of that when his original thing came out.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.960]   They showed a little clip of it, yeah.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:45.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.000]   It was a part of that series that Cringley was doing for--
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.240]   Was it "Trying for the Nerds" or was it later?
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.140]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.640]   It was for PBS, I think.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.080]   That's probably why Steve was talking to him.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.960]   He thought, well, nobody will see this.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.240]   Cringley lives around here.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:02.760]   I cannot--
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.880]   I thought he lived in the-- when he moved up here,
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.800]   he used to be in Palo Alto.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:06.600]   Yeah, no, he moved up here.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.280]   And I cannot get him to show up.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.320]   Oh, he won't come.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.200]   Why?
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.080]   Well, you don't know?
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:11.580]   No.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.080]   Ooh.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.360]   Very coy.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.800]   Wow.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.880]   I'm going to have to ask--
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.840]   should I ask you off the air?
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.840]   You're the only guy that doesn't know.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.440]   There's a reason?
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.240]   I thought you knew.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.480]   Now, my mind is--
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.400]   I mean, going crazy of all the reasons why he might not
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.080]   be going to be seen.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.440]   Is he like the elephant man?
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.280]   No.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.640]   Does he have some strange wasting disease?
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.520]   Now, he's a normal looking guy.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.040]   He looks a little like you a little bit.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:42.480]   Me?
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.080]   No.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:43.600]   Although--
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.600]   Is he an older version?
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.360]   Like an old Mark million?
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.400]   An older Mark million.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.120]   Is there like a fatwa on him?
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.120]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.080]   Like, Salman Rushdie?
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.280]   Like, he can't leave the house because--
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.120]   I don't know about that.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:01.360]   But you've got a thing to read.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.880]   Maybe the chat room could tell me.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.600]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.520]   Is he in the witness protection room?
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.800]   Maybe he doesn't like your meat locker.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.040]   Oh, he's a vegetarian.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.000]   That could be it.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.400]   The show brought to you by Gazelle.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.440]   You know the timing is good because we do have all of these
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.840]   new things coming out.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:22.320]   And Gazelle is the best place to go now to get a quote on
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.520]   your iPhone.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.720]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.880]   You may look at the new iPhone when it comes out in a couple
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.720]   of weeks and say, I don't really want it.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.400]   But the problem is, by then, the price for your old iPhone
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.640]   will have plummeted.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.680]   So the quotes at Gazelle are good for 30 days.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:42.560]   So my suggestion is just go to Gazelle.com right now.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.960]   Get a quote on your iPhone 4s.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.080]   Which one do you have, John?
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.120]   iPhone?
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.160]   Let's say you had the 32 gigabyte.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.360]   Look, it's worth $257 in good condition if we're in flawless
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.840]   condition, $269.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:58.400]   Now here's the deal.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.320]   You throw that in the box.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.880]   Go through the rest of your closet.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.240]   You've got to have tons of-- you especially, John.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.400]   You have to start tech.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.520]   They all start tech phone as well.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.040]   I don't think they take--
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.960]   they do buy broken iPhones, by the way.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.520]   If you've got a cracked iPhone, I guess they fix it.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.200]   And then they sell it.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.320]   They've got MacBooks.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.680]   Let's see, what are the--
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.000]   you can sell a rim, a BlackBerry rim.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.040]   You could sell a HTC and LG and Motorola.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.360]   I don't think they have flip phones, though.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.080]   Let's see.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.000]   I've got a Verizon Motorola.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.880]   And they get to some of the older droids, stuff like that.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.600]   What do you think--
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.280]   I see the Droid Bionic was terrible.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.760]   That can't be worth very much.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.960]   Say it's in great shape here.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.200]   No water damage.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.960]   Yes, free of water damage, of course it is.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.520]   What's that worth?
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.560]   Hey, that's not bad.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.400]   No, that's a good deal.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.440]   I'd actually take that.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.120]   Let me find it.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.880]   I must have one lying around.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.560]   So you throw those all in your box.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.040]   And then they pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   And then they send you a check.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.000]   Their data experts will wipe the data.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.880]   Let's say you're ready for the new iPad mini.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.400]   That's effectively an iPad, too.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.960]   I think that's what everybody's agreeing.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.760]   Let's say you have the 32 gigabyte.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.080]   Your Gazelle off for $270.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.520]   That's great.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.480]   That probably would pay for the new iPad mini.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.200]   And leave you $20 for a couple of apps.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.560]   I think it's a steal.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.640]   So you throw it in a box.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.400]   You send it to them.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.960]   Their data experts wipe the data.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:28.920]   And they send you a check.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.400]   They'll send you a PayPal.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.040]   They do do.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.240]   And I would recommend this.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.400]   The Amazon gift card, because it's 5% a bonus.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.760]   They kind of rebate the Amazon Associates fee.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.400]   That's what I'm guessing anyway.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:46.840]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.920]   Give it a try today.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.240]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.640]   Looks like Robert Krenzley was on $229.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.360]   Really?
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.240]   Robert X. Krenzley?
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.680]   Was he really?
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.360]   Was I not here?
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:02.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.800]   What?
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.080]   Now you're baffled.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:08.680]   I am baffled.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.600]   Actually, the chat room had part of the answer.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.560]   Earlier on, if you can scroll back, scroll back.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.000]   They knew.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.040]   They knew.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.760]   They know everything.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.400]   You have a good chat room.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.600]   Oh.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.600]   Ooh.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.080]   Oh.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.080]   Mm.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   Mm.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   I didn't know he was around here at all.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.800]   Let's talk about Windows 8.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.440]   We saw IFA, the Berlin--
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.960]   This is what we-- I guess we have to start going to this thing.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.720]   This seems like the thing to go to if I could--
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.040]   Did that start?
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   It's been going on forever.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   The last year.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:42.560]   The 1920s.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.200]   It's a radio show.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:44.600]   It was originally.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.040]   The 1920s.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:50.080]   It stands for-- I'm going to see if I can do the German.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.880]   Intonationale Funk Ocheteling Berlin.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.080]   How do you like that?
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.080]   No?
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.040]   Intonationale Funk.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.120]   Is there anybody from Germany here?
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.440]   Is there anybody who speaks German here?
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.240]   I--
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.960]   You are a disappointment to me all.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.400]   Intonationale Funk Ocheteling Berlin.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.600]   It stands for International Radio Exposition.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.800]   Yeah, Funk Ocheteling.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.600]   Funk-- Funk is radio, right?
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.640]   It's a radio conference?
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.040]   It was.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:20.800]   It was originally.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   It's from the third.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.960]   When the radio first became the next greatest thing
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.640]   to ever happen, it was going to change society as we know it.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   You know, they're talking about--
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.200]   You did?
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.280]   Well, I guess so.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.280]   But--
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:32.800]   Look at this.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.280]   In 1933--
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:33.800]   It's a ball.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.480]   It's interesting now.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.440]   Here's Hitler at it with Gebels.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.880]   There's also a picture of--
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.280]   There's also a famous Einstein picture.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.160]   He was opened at once, one year.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:43.760]   Wow.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.400]   But he did it--
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.200]   So since the '30s.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.720]   Anyway, it has become a very big event--
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:48.560]   It got disconnected more--
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:48.920]   --for him from the--
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.120]   --for him from the--
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:49.960]   --again.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.240]   Well, we don't like you.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.040]   So yeah, that was Gebels not--
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:01.600]   So this year, Samsung had a big event in which they announced
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.520]   a ton of stuff.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.400]   You know, it was ridiculous.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.600]   It was almost like they wanted to say, hey, we're not dead yet.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:08.960]   They're kind of like, look.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.240]   I think Sony did a lot here, too.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.120]   Yeah, Sony did a lot of--
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.840]   --crapple stuff.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.000]   A lot of Windows 8 stuff.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.960]   Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.400]   That was their Android sofa.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.960]   But then I think a lot of the thunder
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:24.360]   was stolen by the Ative S, which is their Windows 8 phone.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.320]   Now, here's-- maybe John, you can decipher this.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.480]   Because Samsung is not saying Windows Phone 8.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.960]   Remember, Windows Phone was Windows Phone 7.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:32.920]   Right.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.360]   They are now saying-- and I think--
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.400]   I don't know if this is Microsoft's doing or Samsung's
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:36.600]   doing it.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.360]   They're calling it a Windows 8 phone.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.440]   It's my opinion-- we talked a little bit about this on Windows
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.360]   Weekly with Paul and Mary Jo on Thursday.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.080]   It's my opinion that this is intentional on Microsoft's part.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.960]   Because if you look at the Windows Phone,
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.480]   the Windows RT tablet, and Windows 8, the desktop--
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.280]   And the Windows 8 tablet to the--
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.520]   They all look the same.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.800]   Yeah, they've done them all down--
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.200]   They've owned phone style.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   Essentially, what they're saying is these are all Windows 8.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.360]   But it's not true, because apps that are designed for the desktop
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.040]   do not run on the tablet, do not run on the phone.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.440]   So I think that there's a little potential problem
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.800]   here for Microsoft that people are--
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.320]   it sounds like they're intentionally
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.000]   trying to confuse people that these are all part
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.800]   of the Windows 8 line, but they're not.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.680]   OK.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.360]   Just a thought.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.240]   No, I think you're right.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.520]   But I don't think it's intentional.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.920]   I think it's a mistake, too.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.080]   But it's not like they're intentionally
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.680]   trying to confuse people.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.960]   Let's see if we can confuse them.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.160]   No, no, no, no, no, you're right.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.520]   They're not trying to confuse people.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.240]   But in their mind, they are all Windows 8.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.640]   This is the new look and feel of Microsoft,
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.000]   and they want everybody to feel like.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.680]   Well, they're assuming that people
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.600]   want to have the same experience manipulating the UI,
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.280]   but they don't necessarily want people--
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.120]   That's a good problem.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:58.240]   --deal with the fact that you can't run Windows Office 2013
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.280]   or whatever it is on the phone.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.000]   It's no different in the Apple world.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.760]   You can't run Apple apps on your iPhone and vice versa.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.960]   Right.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.400]   I was so impressed about how many different form factors
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.960]   are coming out with Windows 8.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.000]   I mean, it's almost like the OEMs got together and said,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.240]   let's do everything possible.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.880]   There's Microsoft's case with the keyboard built in.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.360]   Surface.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.440]   And then you can pull out the screen from the keyboard.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.600]   And some devices, you can swivel it up down every which way.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:29.240]   That's the HP has a strange swiveling.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:29.920]   Yeah, gee.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.120]   Maybe we haven't seen that before.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.360]   It was the Lenovo Yoga.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.880]   The Yoga is very odd.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.800]   Do you think that might reflect more confusion on the OEMs?
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.920]   Part about what Windows 8-- they don't know what's going to stick.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.080]   So let's try everything.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:45.920]   Yeah, let's try everything.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.040]   And there's options now.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.120]   It's not necessarily that thing.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.080]   I have said for a while that people
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.120]   should wait to buy a PC.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.800]   If they think they're going to use Windows 8,
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.320]   don't buy now.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.000]   Wait till the Windows 8 PCs come out,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.080]   because touch is going to be a huge part.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.960]   Actually, it's not HP's that does that swivel thing.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:11.920]   This is HP's Windows 8 UltraBook.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.320]   But they all have touch, don't they?
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:13.760]   It's a few, right?
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.400]   Yeah, this is an UltraBook.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.560]   And see, well, it is detachable.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.040]   That's going to further confuse things.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   It was really weird is that poor Asus, who do the Nexus 7
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.400]   and get a lot of credit for that.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.600]   But they have that little device.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.920]   You have one, that crazy little notebook
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.080]   that hooks onto the keyboard.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:31.920]   The transformer.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.520]   The transformer.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.480]   It's a great product.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.640]   It's amazing.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.720]   It's the-- and they're--
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.400]   Anyway, they just don't know what they're doing.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.080]   They make the best Android tablets.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:42.680]   They're pricey.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.360]   That's the problem.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.200]   And when you look at the Nexus 7 for $200,
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:49.800]   it's hard to then pay $600 to $800 for something.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.000]   But if you're in the market--
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.720]   The Nexus 7 is made by Asus.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.280]   I know.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:54.680]   Well, that's true.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.840]   They're making money either way.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.720]   But I mean, I just feel like that the transformer
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:03.560]   is this champagne of tablets.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.080]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.440]   But it's a lot more expensive.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.840]   So here's the--
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:10.240]   Wordsworth in the chat room pointed out this Toshiba
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.640]   satellite, which kind of--
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:12.600]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.400]   Let me show you that one.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.600]   That accessory looks like this.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.920]   The way it's lashed up, I don't like.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:17.640]   And then there's--
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.040]   This is the UHB-N-PX-2.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   UHB-N-PX-2.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.000]   UHB-N-PX-2.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:22.840]   From Toshiba.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.000]   Catchy name.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.200]   Yeah, they really know how to nail the name.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.160]   And then there's the Dell XPS Duo 12.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.320]   Wow, the Dell is the one with the swivel that was a little odd.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:34.160]   Where are you getting all these?
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.000]   Is this from the chat room?
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.400]   This is a wired.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.600]   Wired, all right.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.120]   You're right.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.560]   You can't say there's not a lot of creativity, is there?
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.160]   I wonder what Invisible Jolie would have to say about this.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.280]   Earl, let's ask Tiny Steve Jobs.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   You know--
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   No, no, keep them down there.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   They're just ripping us off.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   They're just ripping us off.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.280]   They're ripping us off.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.280]   They're ripping us off.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   [SCREAMING]
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   They're ripping us off.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.760]   That's what it's all about.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.760]   This is the--
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:03.760]   This is very insensitive.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.760]   Oh.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.760]   All right.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   You take that--
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.760]   That's not Steve Jobs.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:09.760]   That's I-C-E-O.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.760]   That's not Steve Jobs.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   That's I-C-E-O.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   That's not Steve Jobs.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:18.040]   Actually, wait a minute.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.400]   We should have an empty chair.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.360]   And like Clint Eastwood, I could address Jolie.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.200]   I used that joke earlier in the day.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   I didn't get one.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.200]   I wanted some taped.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.160]   Ah, I just saw John's joke unwittingly.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.640]   Did you-- that was a Clint Eastwood thing?
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.640]   Oh, I missed it.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:37.440]   But you got it on tape, so you win that battle.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:43.480]   And apparently Mr. Snitch Mark Millian wants to make sure you get credit, John.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   Good man.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.480]   Writers stick together.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.160]   Do you-- after looking at all these, you think there's a winner?
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.160]   These tablets?
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.160]   Anything?
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.160]   Mm.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.160]   The iPad?
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.560]   Yeah, I think the iPad is the winner.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:06.600]   Here's the-- this is a rumor, but this Nokia will be announcing new phones.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.360]   They're calling this the Lumia 920.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:12.160]   This is their Windows 8 device.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.200]   Is this what they're showing next week?
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.320]   Presumably, this is what they'll show at Nokia World next week.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.560]   I think they'll also show a Windows RT tablet.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.080]   I think Nokia will do an RT tablet.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:27.000]   Nokia's realized that it's fate, lies with Microsoft and Windows Phone.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.080]   Of course, Steven Eilat, the CEO, is a former Microsofty.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:33.480]   He's been saying for a while, though, that tablets is not their sweet spot.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:34.640]   They're going to have to buy them.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   They could change their mind.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.400]   They also stores get in the past 35 or 40 stores.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.120]   They're going to have to buy Nokia and usually--
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   Microsoft is.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.680]   And I believe you'll see a brand--
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.520]   Why do they need-- but they have manufacturing.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.800]   They don't-- you don't have to buy a company to get manufacturing expertise.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.120]   It's distribution-- distribution deals already.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.400]   But I think they want a branded phone so they can have their store have a--
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.720]   Just as they do with a Surface.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.720]   Right.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.840]   And they're going to have a branded PC and a branded phone.
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.320]   Look, you can buy the Microsoft phone system.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.040]   They're already going to have a branded PC.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.760]   They've got a branded living room game system.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.800]   Yeah, no, but that's because of the retail.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.880]   They're going to retail, retail.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.280]   They're going to have big retail.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.000]   You heard it here first.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.240]   It seems like everything Microsoft does is with Apple Envy in mind.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.640]   They-- Apple hit the home run with these stores.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.720]   The stores have been so successful.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.240]   So what are you supposed to say to yourself?
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.320]   Well, they--
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.760]   Oh, it's already been done.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.880]   We don't-- so we don't want to do it.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.160]   Yeah, you're not going to be that way.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.120]   No, you're going to-- if it works, copy it.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:28.880]   If it works, copy it.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.040]   And they've copied them.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.000]   And they've done a really good job of copying them.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.720]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.720]   Microsoft leads in the living room.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.280]   Back to the Xbox.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.760]   Apple's playing catch up there.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.000]   Do you think Apple wants to do something like the Xbox?
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.120]   No, I think what Apple's decided--
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.320]   I think everybody wants to do something like this.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.480]   No, I think Apple's decided--
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.000]   It was a real TV.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.600]   It was a pain in the ass to do it.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.520]   It's a media center.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.520]   But the back of the show--
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.720]   Yes, the media center, they do want to do it.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.240]   The Xbox--
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:53.800]   The Xbox--
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.040]   They're maybe successful, but they've never
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.240]   made any money in the Xbox.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.520]   It's a big, big loser.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.520]   No, I think it's making money now.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.520]   I think it's making money now.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.920]   But now they're making up for the hundreds of millions
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   of dollars that they lost.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   For the first 10 years, they lost billions.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.320]   And they got lucky that Sony dropped the ball.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.320]   Yes, and Nintendo.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.920]   Well, Nintendo's kind of a slightly different market.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.320]   But Sega quit, and Sony dropped the ball.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.320]   That's an interesting question.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.120]   You think that the Xbox 360 has net made money
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.720]   or is now just starting to make money?
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.120]   My understanding is it's made money net,
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.320]   because once you start making money in that business,
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.720]   you make lots of it.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.520]   I don't think they break it out.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.920]   But the $50, $60 a year Xbox live service,
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.320]   that's a money maker.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.320]   Huge.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:43.920]   Microsoft says it sold 66 million Xboxes and 18 million
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.520]   connects.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.920]   And they say connect was the fastest selling consumer
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.320]   electronics devices over a short period.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.120]   Yeah, just put a spy device right in your own house.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.120]   I think it's fantastic.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.320]   Take your broccoli money.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.320]   You're living up to your bill and John,
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.320]   and I don't like that about you.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.920]   Spy device.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.920]   It is.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.120]   They know they have software that can take that thing
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.520]   and turn it on and look at all the things that you have
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.920]   in your house, literally.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.920]   And then see what kind of works.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.720]   They don't have to watch.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.720]   They dance naked in front of it every day.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.520]   I'm sure that's on somebody's video right now.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.920]   They say, hey, come on over, check this out.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.120]   Look at this guy.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.320]   So, and then they can say, you know, this guy is probably
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.520]   susceptible to this sort of advertising.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.520]   And so then they start pumping ads at you.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.920]   Eh, I could do without it.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   You know, you'll like the--
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   You know I'm right, by the way.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]   You're probably right.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.920]   You know, you'll like the New Dell 27-inch iMac clone
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.720]   because it has a shutter on the camera.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.720]   You could slide a thing--
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   Oh, because I usually put a big piece of tape over mine.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.720]   I knew that.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   There's a lot of people doing that.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.720]   The black electrical tape.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   I use gaffers tape.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720]   Sorry.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.720]   I think it's more symbolic of show business.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.420]   Well, you like this as a little shutter.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.120]   I think that's an interesting thing that manufacturers
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.720]   say, hmm, this might be a selling point.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720]   Let's take a break.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720]   Come back with more.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.520]   Mark Millian is here from Bloomberg Business Week of Fine.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.920]   You write for the online, but you also write for the print.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   Yes.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.920]   Really good resource.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.320]   You know, I was thinking-- like I said, I was thinking of buying the
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.120]   economists, grabbing the economists, which is 140 bucks a year.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.520]   It's really outrageous.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.520]   How much does it cost?
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520]   No, no, no.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520]   It's too bad I threw the subscription card.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520]   They have the--
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.520]   To the audience.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.520]   --deals for the economists.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520]   They do?
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.840]   It's months for like one-tenth of price, and then you just keep
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.120]   changing your name.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.520]   You save a lot of money.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.520]   How much do you have to deal?
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.720]   What is the subscription cost on this thing?
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720]   I don't know, but I'll find out for you.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.920]   It's too bad I threw away the-- you know, most of these magazines,
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.520]   they have 15 blowing cards.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.520]   You got one.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.520]   Yeah, we got one.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.520]   It's a quality product.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.520]   We don't want to--
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.520]   It's a quality product.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.520]   It's 26 issues for $20.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.520]   Wow, that is a deal.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.520]   That's a steal.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.520]   I might-- you know what?
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.320]   You're going to-- you beat the economists on price alone.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.320]   Yeah, $40 a year.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320]   That's a lot less.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   That's like a third as much.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.320]   And it's not snooty like the economists.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320]   The economists have snooty.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.320]   It's not a snooty.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.320]   Very darn hard.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.320]   Here's the subscription card.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.320]   Thank you for saving that for me.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320]   Because I'm going to fill this out.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.320]   What's it say?
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.320]   100 issues for $100.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   It's a bucking issue.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   50 issues for $60.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   A buck, 20 an issue.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   That is a good deal.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   A bucking issue is a year.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   That's a come-up what?
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   It's weekly.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   It's weekly.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   So that's two years.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   Two years.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   For 100 bucks.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   That's a deal.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.320]   You can do-- can you play cash?
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   No.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.320]   Yeah, good luck with that.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.320]   Where is this located?
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320]   Oh, I'll just go to Boone, Iowa.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.320]   And I'll find him.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.320]   It's the home base.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.320]   Got a big bureau there.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.320]   There's a bunch of prisoners there entering data.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.320]   That's all that is.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.320]   I used to send my-- all my bills went to Sioux City, South Dakota.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.320]   And I realized that's where big prison is.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   And that's why I sent all my bills there.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.320]   So the prisoners-- because they're not going to steal my data.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   Prisoners are reliable.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.320]   Honest people.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.320]   Yeah, the banks picked them.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   Let's talk about Ford.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.320]   You got anything to say about Ford?
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.320]   Yeah, you know, when is that electric car coming out, A?
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.320]   It's out.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.320]   I haven't seen one.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   Oh, I've driven one.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320]   It's beautiful.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.320]   2012 Ford Focus.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.320]   It's out.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   And they've got the plug-in hybrid.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.320]   Is next.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.320]   Do you want a plug-in?
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.320]   I think you want a plug-in hybrid.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   That's okay.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.320]   Well, the reason is because the hybrid means you have a gas engine.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.320]   So if you go more than the rate--
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.320]   You just go to the straight electric?
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320]   Oh, you got it.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320]   The torque in this thing.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.320]   You know, that Focus is a pretty interesting little car.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   It's very well designed.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.320]   I agree.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320]   What they did is they--
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.320]   They're really hard to flip.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.320]   I don't think that's what I was thinking.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.320]   I was thinking more that they did a European design.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320]   It's very European.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.320]   Yeah, they got a lot of--
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.320]   It's elegant.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.320]   A lot of stuff going on with the inside of that thing.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.320]   Stuff going on.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.320]   Yeah, I mean, they got the wheels set up so they--
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.320]   No, that's beautiful.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.320]   It's hard to flip.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.320]   Hard to flip.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.320]   That's another reason to drive a Ford.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   If you visit social.ford.com, this is their new Ford Social site.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   And it's interesting.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   Ford is really--
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.320]   Are you going to get an electric one?
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.320]   [sighs]
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   You know, I was going to get-- no, I'm on the list for the 2012.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.320]   Electric.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.320]   Ford Focus, all electric.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.320]   And then I saw the plug-in hybrid.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.320]   I thought that's the next comes out in a couple of months.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.320]   Makes more sense.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   Yeah, because it has kind of unlimited range.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.320]   And the plug-in allows you to go across the bridge free.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.320]   Right.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   And plug-in also means that you can run electric most of the time.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   I mean, it's electric for short range.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.320]   And you--
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   It's not like a hybrid.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.320]   You know when you go to the Oakland airport, you can plug-in free.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.320]   I know, and you get the best seat in the house, too.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   So here's the--
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.320]   Social.ford.com, you get badges.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.320]   I like the old classic one, but they have a geek badge.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320]   Look at this.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   This is the tech geek badge you put on your Facebook or your Twitter.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.320]   I mean, it's more than that.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.320]   They also have a lot of really good articles on a variety of subjects.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.320]   If you look at the technologies section, you'll see an article that I wrote about an interview
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:03.320]   I had with Jim Butchkowski, who is a technology technologist at Ford.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   Because I was-- I'm really curious about a couple of things.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   One is what's going on with sync, because I have sync in my Mustang.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320]   But also new technologies.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.320]   I think autonomous vehicles.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.320]   I think we're edging in that direction.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.320]   So I talked a little bit with him about that.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.320]   What do you say?
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:25.320]   Well, he said what Ford has told me all along, which is we're not going to make 100% autonomous vehicle yet.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.320]   But what we're doing is driver assist.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.320]   The idea is that you've got to have a human in there, just as you do on an airplane.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.320]   But what you do is you give the human more and more information so they're safer and safer drivers.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:40.320]   So for instance, you drift out of the lane, pretentious the seat belts gives you a warning.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.320]   And actually, this isn't in the car yet, but it will steer you back into the lane.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   There's all sorts of stuff that they're doing. It's really interesting.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.320]   So we're this close.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.320]   Do you like autonomous vehicles or no?
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:54.320]   I told you on a previous show that we're just finishing a book on them.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.320]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.320]   Or I knew it, but I forgot it.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:01.320]   Yeah, you forgot that Cringley was on the show too.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   I don't remember that.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320]   Starting to go.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   Yeah, that's probably true.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:13.320]   Social.Ford.com, read the articles, share your ideas, read what other people's ideas is like their suggestion box.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.320]   And you can vote on ideas as well.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320]   This is fantastic.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:24.320]   If you've had a good idea about what could make a car afford better than go to Ford, uh, Social.Ford.com.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.320]   Also people posting pictures. I love this.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.320]   My pony with added horse powers is, this is so cute.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.320]   People love their pony cars. I love my pony car.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.320]   I understand that.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:39.320]   We thank Social.Ford.com. We thank them for their support of our shows.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.320]   And for making great vehicles and bringing the pride back to America.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.320]   So, now we have Jolie Odell in the seat.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   She made it.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.320]   You know, she's going to be mad because I know they didn't invite her because she's not a flake.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.320]   You think that we thought she was going to be here, but...
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.320]   Does he Chad went to Atlanta and he left me a note on my desk.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.320]   He emailed me and said she was coming.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.320]   Yeah, I thought I think there's a...
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.320]   Yeah, no, I bet you 10 bucks that she doesn't know anything about this.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.320]   I feel bad.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   I mean, I would bet even money.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.320]   I feel...
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.320]   We're actually a double or nothing. I double it up or double odds.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   She smells good.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.320]   So, she's going to be irked when she finds out.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.320]   How come you didn't know I am?
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.320]   But of course she hasn't got a phone number and there's other.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.320]   We could tweet her.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.320]   Bruce, is that gatherer's tape you used to hold that up?
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   So, you know, that's that green crap you used for painting that masks this certain kind of masking.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:39.320]   So, Bruce Willis is going to fight Apple over the rights to his music collection after his death.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.320]   What?
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.320]   [laughter]
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.320]   So, there was a good article. I like this article.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:52.320]   This was a more serious article that said, you know, according to the terms of service, when you die, your digital...
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.320]   You know, your books, your music, they don't go with you.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.320]   You know, if you had a 300 book library, you could give it to your heirs.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.320]   You can't do it with your Kindle.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:08.320]   So, Bruce Willis wants to leave his huge digital music collection to his daughters,
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.320]   from her scout in Tallulah.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.320]   But under iTunes, current terms and conditions, customers borrow the tracks.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.320]   You don't own them.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:23.320]   Willis has asked his advisors to set up a trust that holds his downloads, including the Beatles, Led Zeppelin.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.320]   There was a great $99 complete thing. Everything Led Zeppelin ever recorded.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320]   They don't offer it anymore, but I bought it.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.320]   I'd love to hand that down to my children.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   Uh-huh.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.320]   And so, wait a minute. Let's stop.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   So, you've got this Led Zeppelin iPod, I guess. That's what it is, right?
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   No, no. It was just a digital download.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   Oh, just a big pile of downloads.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.320]   And they're on... Where are they now?
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.320]   It's hard drives. I have it on my hard drive at home.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.320]   Okay. And so, you drop dead.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.320]   And then the kids take the computers and stuff, and then they have them.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.320]   So, you tell me that's not possible.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320]   Apple says no that...
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   Well, how's Apple gonna know?
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   They're tracking everybody's downloads, and they're saying,
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.320]   "Well, Leo's died, and his kids are playing the music.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.320]   Let's bust in."
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   Well, you must have happened by now, right? I mean, people died.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   I haven't heard this.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.320]   What happens? Do you...
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.320]   They don't DR on the tracks anymore, so...
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.320]   Right.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.320]   I mean, understand what the issues are.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.320]   Kindles DRM though.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.320]   Some of it.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.320]   I think there's...
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   You can pretty much load up a kind of with no DRM stuff.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.320]   I mean, there's so much stuff out there.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   Right.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:32.320]   This might be an argument to buy books and records.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   No?
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.320]   No, because this is not gonna happen.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.320]   You're gonna die, and you're gonna...
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   Bruce Willis is looking for publicity.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   He does look like he's looking for...
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.320]   It's a huge picture.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.320]   I'm looking bigger than the article.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   Look out, this is bogus.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.320]   Seriously.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.320]   The article is about...
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   He's sitting around with his buddies, and he says, "You know,
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   I bet you I can get a bunch of publicity for this."
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   I'm gonna pull his...
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   This is the picture.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.320]   It's a scam.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.320]   He looks like he's ready to take on Apple, doesn't he?
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.320]   He's got that die-hard gleam in his eye.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   All right.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.320]   There was a good article on MarketWatch.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.320]   You've heard of them.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.320]   Yes, I actually write for them.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   Who inherited...
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   This is maybe you know Quentin Fortrell, which...
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   I've never met him.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   Who inherited your iTunes library?
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.320]   I think it's an interesting question, but I don't know what the answer is.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:31.320]   You're saying violate the terms of service and the law and just keep the damn thing.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:38.320]   According to Amazon, you do not acquire any ownership rights in the software or music content.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:49.320]   Apple limits the use of digital files to Apple devices used by the account holder.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.320]   Just make a hard drive and just give it to them.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.320]   All right.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.320]   I'll do that.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.320]   Who found that article?
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.320]   That's a...
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.320]   Well, this article is wild.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:06.320]   You seem to be dwelling on this for some unknown reason.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.320]   Have you seen the Nexus 7 ad?
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.320]   No.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.320]   You have it?
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.320]   I might play it if you're nice.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.320]   Is this the James Franco...
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.320]   The one on the homepage?
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.320]   The one that...
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.320]   Well, that's one thing.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.320]   No.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.320]   Okay.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.320]   Let me ask you about that because when you go to google.com there...
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.320]   Oh, there.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.320]   You get a number of things now.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.320]   Let me do it again.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.320]   I've got to google.com.
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.320]   You get an ad.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.320]   This thing pops up.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320]   This thing just bounced up.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.320]   I'll do it hard refresh.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.320]   There you go.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   That's what I need to do here.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   Maybe you got to clear your cash and now I want it bouncing.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.320]   It bounces?
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.320]   Watch.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   You got to watch closely, John.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.320]   It's going to go very fast.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320]   Look.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.320]   I don't see anything.
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   Look.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.320]   Watch.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320]   Here comes.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.320]   This way it bumps into the text.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.320]   That's so you'll click it.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.320]   Also now I get birthday announcements on my Google.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.320]   Oh, I get that too.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.320]   Which I don't really want.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.320]   And so what's weird is it's almost from the G.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.320]   It's all from Google.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.320]   And so you see people I don't know.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320]   This guy, yeah, exactly.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.320]   Who is that?
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.320]   At least Facebook is my friends.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.320]   For this Nexus 7 ad somebody dragged out an old Marissa Meyer quote saying, "We'll never
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.320]   have flashy bouncing advertisements on the homepage."
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.320]   She's gone.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.480]   She's a Yahoo and Yahoo won't have them anymore.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.480]   So this is actually, I apologize.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:32.040]   This is not a Nexus 7 ad.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.320]   This is a Galaxy Note ad.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320]   Strangest ad in the history of the world.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.320]   Let me go to YouTube and we can watch it on YouTube because I can go full screen.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.320]   3.4 million.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.320]   So obviously successful.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.160]   3.4 million downloads.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.320]   Can you get my audio?
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320]   Oh, hi.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   Oh, hi.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320]   I'm James Franco.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.320]   James, in the past few years I've acted in a bunch of movies.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.320]   I've written some, I've produced some, and I've directed some.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.320]   I've also appeared on the soap opera.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.320]   It's using a stylist.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.320]   I did a theatrical dance company.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320]   Now he's making eggs.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.320]   I wrote a book of short stories.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320]   What is the purpose of this ad?
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.320]   I'm even doing a nice commercial.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.840]   Ah, Bruce, give me a little wider.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.320]   And cue the tiger.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:30.480]   So the tiger comes in on a cage.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.320]   And now he's drawing, I don't, I--
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   James, I don't feel so good.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   Really?
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.320]   A small glance.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.320]   Stick out your tongue.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   I guess this is to demonstrate what?
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   I can diagnose people.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.320]   I'll send that to your doctor just in case.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320]   Lots of rest, lots of fluids.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   Make sure she dies, ladies.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.320]   Yeah, James.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.320]   Now his escape parking is backyard.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.320]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320]   I can't watch anymore of this.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.320]   This is terrible.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.320]   What is the point of this?
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.320]   Not to sell.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.320]   I don't get it.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.320]   And by the way, that's only about a minute of the two and a half days.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.320]   That was plugging what?
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   Didn't you notice that he had a Galaxy Note 10.1 in his hands?
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.320]   I don't think I would buy it because James Franco says to buy it.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.320]   Galaxy Note, like that big giant phone?
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:35.320]   Yeah, well now they like the brand so much they're applying it to everything else.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.320]   Big, big flaw in Java that affects both everybody.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.320]   Windows, Mac, and Linux.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.320]   This story from Bloomberg this week.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.320]   It apparently is run by droopy dog.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.320]   Oracle fixes Java exploits four months after hacker flag bugs.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.320]   But guess what?
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:00.320]   Security firms are now saying that the fix, which was shipped emergency patch shipped on
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:07.320]   Friday, has other problems, similar problems that allow a malicious website to use the
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:12.320]   tool installed on your system to take over your system.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:20.320]   So the advice of the folks that do F-protect frisk software is just turn Java off.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:28.320]   Java is a mess and most people don't need it anymore.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.320]   There is the Galaxy S3 is now available in Earth tones.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.320]   Do you care now?
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.320]   I do.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.320]   President Obama grants an interview to a racist teen nude picture website.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:46.320]   Do you hear the scandalous story going around that Instagram is becoming the big porn site now?
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.320]   I saw that story, but it looked like it just a bid to get links.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.320]   Of course it's got to be.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320]   You know, definitely link bait.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.320]   Yeah, you know, but they actually did read the story because it worked.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.320]   And it said, here's the tags to search for if you're looking for Insta porn.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.320]   Insta porn is one of them.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.320]   Insta porn, okay.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.320]   And hand bra.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   Hand bra.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   You're laughing as if you know what that means.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.320]   What is it?
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.320]   Some sort of hand bra.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.320]   But if you search for that, apparently you get something.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.320]   What else?
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.320]   Just wondering.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.320]   I could tell you, but I don't know if you're ready for it.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   So what's the...
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:29.320]   Here's the problem that Instagram has 15 employees to review pictures.
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.320]   And they have more than 15 million new pictures a day.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.320]   That's a million pictures per employee.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320]   Kind of hard.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320]   Well, Facebook's the same way.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320]   How do you wait for people to flag it?
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320]   That's what they use.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.320]   They use the flagging mechanism, right?
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.320]   I just looked at it really good who's going to flag it.
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:49.320]   I've been looking for good pictures on Instagram for months and I can't find anything.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.320]   So I don't think it's working.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:58.320]   So the Instagram acquisition as of three years ago is now they were cleared.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.320]   When does Kevin's system get his money?
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320]   That's what he wants.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:07.320]   Well, the acquisition is now after being valued at roughly a billion dollars is now valued at
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.320]   $740 million thanks to Facebook's stock tag.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.320]   That's why he's in a hurry because he's system by money.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320]   He's dribbling and losing out.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.320]   What?
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   Do you think anybody has any right to be upset over the fact that Facebook's stock is cut in half from its IPF?
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320]   It's really only worth $7.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:29.320]   Well, I think the employees who came on just before the IPO and were promised great riches and stock.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.320]   Well, if your strike price is $38 on your Facebook stock, you're not happy that it's what?
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320]   $17.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320]   And the investors who got in on that last round.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.320]   That's, yeah.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.320]   But I mean, really.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:47.320]   In fact, I saw somebody wrote, "Those people obviously never read the prospectus or Mark Zuckerberg's letter saying,
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.320]   we're not in it for the short haul.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.320]   We don't expect profits for some time."
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.320]   Now, Adam, last week Adam said it's hopeless.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.320]   It's never going to make any money.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.320]   They're never going to crack this Facebook issue.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320]   I thought they were making money.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.320]   Well, they do make a few billion dollars a year, but it's just a few billion.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.320]   That's...
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.320]   They're making...
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:08.320]   They're making less all the time.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.320]   They're not making less all the time.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.320]   They're making more all the time.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.320]   There's not as much more.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.320]   Maybe that's it.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.320]   The velocity is not...
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:18.320]   The velocity is crap because they're already huge companies.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.320]   They can't grow much.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.320]   Yeah, they should have done this IPO earlier.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320]   Hey, bad news.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.320]   Severe calorie restriction does not prolong life in monkeys.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.320]   Yeah, I love that story.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.320]   I...
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.320]   You were just starving yourself.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.320]   I've been starving myself for years now.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   Always.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.320]   Always.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.320]   Always said it was a mistake.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.320]   Turns out after was a rat study, right?
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.320]   Many moons ago now, that rats who were not given enough food lived longer.
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:53.320]   So they started a long-term study in 1987.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   Wow.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.320]   That's like 25 years ago.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.320]   Keeping a long time to starve, rhesus monkeys.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:10.320]   The sad fact is that the calorie-restricted, skinny monkeys did not live any longer than
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.320]   monkeys who got to eat normal amounts of food.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.320]   There you go.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:21.320]   So it's really upsetting to a lot of people for 25 years who have believed that this calorie
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:26.320]   restriction was going to be the key to longevity.
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:31.320]   Some researchers just basically tossed the result out.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.320]   Director of the National...
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   Sorry, the Nutritional Obesity Research Center at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:43.320]   in Louisiana said, "I wouldn't discard the whole thing on the basis of one study.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.320]   I'd still bet on an extension of life."
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:49.320]   I think that really maybe it's time to think of something else.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.320]   Pirate Bay founder, a co-founder, caught and arrested in Cambodia.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   This kind of breaks my heart.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.320]   These are the guys who were...
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:04.320]   You know, remember Pirate Bay would publish the takedown requests and mock them.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320]   People still do that.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.320]   They say, "You can't get us.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.320]   What we are doing is not illegal, ha-ha-ha."
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:14.320]   I think Twitter does that, but without the mocking.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.320]   We are...
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   It was the takedown request.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:22.320]   So Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfried Zvarthom Vorg has been tracked down and arrested, not
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.320]   in Sweden, but in Cambodia.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.320]   What?
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:30.320]   He's been living there since the charges were filed in 2009.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320]   Now, the good news is...
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.320]   They tracked him down like a dog?
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.320]   But Sweden has no extradition treaty with Cambodia.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:41.320]   So then what was the point of the track down?
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.320]   I don't know.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:46.320]   He was arrested in Penan Pen.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:56.320]   All four of the Pirate Bay founders were sentenced to years in prison in 2009 in order to pay $4.4 million in damages.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   They appealed.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.320]   Warg did not.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.320]   He failed to turn up.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:08.320]   He was found guilty in October, and he just never showed up when they said, "Come on, time to go to jail."
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.320]   Time to go to jail.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:15.320]   Where would you go if you were on the run from the feds?
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.320]   Somewhere that didn't have an extradition treaty with the US, right?
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.320]   I think Paraguay would be a good place.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.320]   Paraguay is a nice area.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.320]   Do they not have an extra...
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.320]   I'm pretty sure I think Argentina may also be one.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.320]   Oh, I'd go to Argentina.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.320]   Very nice area.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.320]   I'd rather go there.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.320]   Good Italian, Cambodia.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.320]   I like Buenos Aires.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.320]   Nice city.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320]   But you get out of the town.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   It's like living in Tuscany.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   It's beautiful.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.320]   Well, it's a wine growing country.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320]   Yeah, it's gorgeous.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.320]   You know.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   All right.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.320]   So you and me, Argentina, maybe we'll join Crenchley.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.320]   Someone in the chat room suggests North Korea.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.320]   I think there's flaws in that plan.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.320]   You could live like a king.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   We were talking about the Kindle.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   Good news.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.320]   Nick Bilton has for a while been on a campaign in the New York Times to get the FAA to re-exist.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.320]   The FAA to re-examine its flight policies, they say yes.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.200]   The FAA announced it's formed a government industry group to study the use of consumer electronic
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.320]   devices on flights.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.600]   US Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600]   I like that name.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:21.720]   Ray LaHood calls the rules governing electronic devices in flight of consumer interest.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.920]   And perhaps they will revise them, but don't worry.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.400]   They will never, they say, allow cell phone use.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.840]   They say, they say.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:35.760]   The scam is to use a cell phone use with a femto cell inside the plane itself.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.600]   Oh, so you use the Wi-Fi in the plane.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.280]   Turn on the femto cell and then turn on the cell phone.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.280]   You're good to go.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.280]   Or you could use that.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.960]   I mean, you got idiots all over the phone yacking away and talking too loud.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.480]   Are people doing that?
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.120]   They're actually making phone calls in flight?
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120]   No, they can.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.400]   If they had a femto cell and the thing was coordinated somehow.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.680]   Or to your point, Skype or FaceTime?
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.680]   FaceTime.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.400]   Whatever it is, I don't like it.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:02.600]   But do you do like the idea that you could look at your Kindle while they're taking off,
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:03.600]   right?
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:04.600]   Or do you care?
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.080]   You know, I usually fall asleep on the runway.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.320]   Apparently, I do too.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.320]   You know what?
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.320]   That's funny.
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.320]   I do too.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.320]   No, I do too.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.320]   Do you train yourself?
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.320]   You do too.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.320]   Yeah, you train yourself.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.320]   I thought it was some sort of reaction to the danger of taking off.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.720]   Taking off and I was just practiced.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.700]   The greatest time that's ever happened to me, I have to relate this.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:28.820]   So I'm in Texas and I fell asleep in the runway as usual and woke up in Germany.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:29.820]   I love it.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.820]   I fell asleep in Texas and I woke up in Germany.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:33.820]   It's unbelievable.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:36.500]   I think that's a country song.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.460]   I've never had that at work.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.460]   What a great flight.
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.460]   That's the perfect flight.
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:41.460]   Great flight.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.820]   Were you in life flat business class?
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.660]   It was a lie almost flat business class.
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.620]   I'm flying to Australia and November in economy.
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:49.940]   No.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:51.940]   Why would you take a flight like that at your age?
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.180]   It was 10 grand to fly in business.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.740]   You got to have upgrade miles.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.780]   I don't have enough miles.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:01.260]   You think I'll, what do they call it?
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:02.260]   Flabitis?
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:05.100]   No, no, no, what I would do now, I start working on the PR immediately.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.940]   Find out what the people...
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:07.940]   United Airlines.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:08.940]   Oh, United, forget it.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:14.740]   You're doomed.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.300]   I will be wearing my compression socks.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:21.700]   However, giant thighs when you get off the plane.
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.420]   I'm nervous.
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:24.420]   I know.
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:25.420]   It's what?
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.420]   It's 17 hours in economy?
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.420]   It's horrible.
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.420]   That's the world's worst flight.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.100]   I'll probably get a middle seat.
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:31.100]   Oh.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.660]   Can you imagine?
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:35.500]   But somebody, there's an every single flight to Australia.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:39.020]   There's probably several dozen people with middle seats in economy.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:40.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:41.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:42.020]   And they're all miserable.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.020]   You'll be a good company.
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.820]   I do have that Sky Mall pillow.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:45.820]   You're right.
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:46.820]   So I'll be able to sleep.
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.700]   The giant pillow that you put your head on.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:49.700]   Yeah, I see.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.580]   You're looking like a complete idiot.
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.380]   I don't care.
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:56.260]   Our show brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.900]   Very excited.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:01.500]   We've got a very good deal for Twit listeners.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.180]   This is a special deal Audible only does on Twit.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:09.180]   Of two books for me, you know about Audible.com.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.660]   If you've been listening to any of our shows, we talk about it all the time.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:14.300]   I'm a big fan.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.780]   And some great books coming out.
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.940]   And you know, exciting new.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.420]   This falls biggest blockbusters.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:21.420]   You've got a section at Audible.com.
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:22.820]   So this is an audiobook store.
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:26.760]   A hundred thousand titles plus new ones all the time.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:30.260]   The new Clive Cussler's coming out.
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:33.460]   Lee Child's killing floor coming out.
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:38.900]   Some great sci-fi nonfiction, the happiness project.
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:39.900]   All the presidents.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.500]   Man, oh, that'll be fun.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500]   That was a good book.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.340]   I read that paper when it came out.
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:45.740]   But you can listen now.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.980]   I love listening because it's like somebody's reading to you.
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:53.420]   My son who has a hard time, he's got a learning disability.
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.780]   I think it's probably dyslexia.
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:28:00.100]   He says, I read a page and I just don't, I don't absorb it after read it over and over.
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.100]   I got a audio book.
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:02.100]   He loves it.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.940]   Got a Audible account.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:09.060]   Lots of books for young people, for young adults.
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:13.660]   And it's a great way to discover the joy of reading when you can't normally read.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.860]   Here's the new, this looks kind of good.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.300]   I like Julia Child.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:18.300]   I like her story.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:22.580]   The new Bob Spitz did some great biographies on Dylan and The Beatles.
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:28.100]   His new one is Derry, the remarkable life of Julia Child.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:32.780]   Listening, I don't know, just pours the book into your brain and it really feels like you
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:38.740]   are, it's almost like you're watching a movie.
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:39.740]   Really fantastic.
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:40.740]   I want you to try it out.
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:43.380]   If you visit audible.com, well this is interesting.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:48.540]   I want you to include making wise choices in the midst of raw emotions.
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:52.060]   I need that.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:57.140]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you'll sign up for the platinum account.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.700]   That's the two book a month subscription.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.060]   But the first month's free, your first two books are free.
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.060]   Cancel at any time.
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.180]   Pay nothing yours to keep.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.380]   Here's the teen stuff, Audible Essentials, teen edition, 25 books.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:12.300]   You have to hear Audible has done a great job of, they call this programming I guess
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:16.620]   when you talk about movie theaters, of programming books, the book thief, that was a great book.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:21.020]   Hunger Games, absolutely true story of a part time indie and I remember that.
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.860]   That was a great book.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:27.700]   Twilight, Tree Grows and Bookland, Ender's Games, special 20th anniversary edition.
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:31.300]   If you've not read Ender's game, listen to it.
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:34.020]   Harlan Ellison does a part of this by the way.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.220]   Mark Zuckerberg lists on his Facebook profile.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.580]   It's one of his favorite books.
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:42.980]   It's an amazing book with probably the greatest twist of any book ever.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:44.460]   Have you read it?
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.460]   I have not read it.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:46.460]   I won't say any more then.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:49.820]   I don't want to spoil it for you.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:54.100]   And then there's a whole series after this event but the first one is the one that you
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.540]   absolutely must read Ender's game.
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:57.300]   Anyway, go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.340]   The hard thing is going to be to pick one book.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.540]   You want to read about Joe Perterno?
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:02.540]   There's a new biography.
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.540]   Just came out.
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:07.900]   Oh, you know what?
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:08.900]   This is good.
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.620]   My dad recommended this.
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:12.380]   And actually I'm going to put this on my list.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:14.980]   You have this add to wish list.
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:16.740]   I'm going to add it to my wish list.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.540]   I always come across books I want to listen to.
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:25.140]   It's called The Righteous Mind, Why Good People Are Divided on Politics and Religion.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:26.140]   And it has to do.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.140]   I've noticed this.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.140]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:32.460]   It's a social psychologist.
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:38.300]   He says moral intuition, which is the nearly instantaneous perception we have about other
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:39.900]   people and the things they do.
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.380]   You and I are good at that.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:43.780]   Instant, absolute judgment, right?
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:44.780]   Totally.
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.420]   You can look at a box of software and immediately, if that's any good or not.
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:54.180]   These intuitions feel like self-evident truths, making us righteously certain that those who
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:56.620]   see things differently are wrong.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:57.620]   Probably true.
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:01.460]   You and I, we live in a black and white world, don't we, John C. de Vorac?
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.620]   Are you a gray guy?
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:08.500]   Do you see things in 50 Shades of Grey or even more?
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:09.700]   Are you more black and white?
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:13.060]   Depends on what chapter you're talking about.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:16.820]   He says we are fundamentally groupish.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:21.540]   It's our groupishness that leads to our greatest joys, but also our divisions.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:25.860]   It's tribal Mac versus PC, Android versus iPhone.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.460]   I got to read this.
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:30.740]   And then there's a...
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.700]   Go ahead, crack yourself a tall one.
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:34.620]   Is that our new energy drink that you got there?
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.620]   No, this is this stuff.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:37.860]   It's an Izzie, a sparkling Clementine Izzie.
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:38.860]   Twit-bull?
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:39.860]   Twit-bull.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:40.860]   We should do that.
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:43.660]   We should do an energy drink.
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:44.660]   That would be great.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:46.660]   This is...
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:51.260]   I just got this book called The End of Money that I'm very intrigued in.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.260]   That's actually quite good.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.260]   Have you read it?
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:54.260]   No.
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:59.380]   But I have heard the guy give an hour lecture about it and I think I've read it kind of,
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:02.300]   because I can't see anything else that could be in the book that he didn't say.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.700]   He says say goodbye to your beloved Benjamin's because the world is going cashless, which...
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:06.700]   Right.
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:09.100]   You don't like, but I think maybe you might be a good thing.
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.020]   Anyway, this is my next read.
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.020]   I think you should...
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:16.500]   I'm gathering ammunition with which to fight you and your broccoli...
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:17.500]   It's not me you're fighting.
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.500]   It's not me you're fighting.
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:21.740]   It's going to be the banks when they try to screwy out all your money.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:22.740]   That's going to...
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:23.740]   That's where you'll be fighting.
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:24.740]   I got it in my mattress.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.740]   I'm safe.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.740]   I'm going to be counting it, counterfeiters, fitters, preachers, techies, dreamers, and
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.220]   the coming cashless society.
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.460]   I can't wait to read that.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.260]   Anyway, I've given you a couple of ideas for books.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:35.860]   Maybe End of Money is a game, maybe this, that you might want to write.
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:38.780]   That is a re-mine comp if you're going to read that last book.
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:42.780]   I mean, it's just going to talk about fascism because that's what you're talking about
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:43.780]   with a cashless society.
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.780]   We're headed towards fascism.
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:45.780]   Yeah, totally.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:49.500]   Realistically, how far are we from a cashless society?
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.500]   There's been so much talk about this.
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.060]   We're just seeing it a long way.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.060]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:55.660]   It's a technological issue, I think.
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:56.660]   No.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:57.660]   It's people like me.
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:58.660]   Psychological.
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:32:59.660]   But you thought...
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.780]   And I think all of China, by the way.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:02.820]   Well, maybe that's another issue.
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:07.140]   But I bet you, like many others, thought, "Oh, we'll always have books.
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:08.140]   Books are too good."
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.140]   We have books.
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:10.140]   We still do.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:13.780]   Yeah, but I mean, it's come pretty clear that e-books are about to eclipse printed books.
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:14.780]   Yes.
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:15.780]   Is that a problem?
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:17.780]   No, but I think that a lot of us thought that can't happen.
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:19.420]   Books are too great.
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:23.140]   And what happens to technologies kind of assume a life of their own and people get used
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.780]   to it and that happens.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:26.100]   So, you know, it's a cashless society.
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.100]   It's common.
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.100]   Filmless.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:29.100]   Filmless?
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:30.100]   Yes.
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.100]   Perfect example.
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:32.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.100]   When's the last time you used film?
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:37.460]   I had some film on the bathtub the other day that I had to clean off.
[01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:39.460]   It's a different kind of film.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.820]   Internet addiction is fueled by a gene mutation, says scientists.
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:49.620]   A variation in one gene, C-H-R-N-A4, is more prevalent among those who are addicted to
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:52.100]   being online than those who are not.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:53.100]   Oh, really?
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:57.340]   And significantly more common in women.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.660]   These are the Facebook women and the Pinteresters.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:01.660]   And the Pinteresters.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.820]   It explains Pinterest.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.820]   I agree with that.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:05.060]   I don't know if I though.
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:06.060]   I think so.
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:08.060]   Do you even buy that there's such a thing as Internet addiction?
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.940]   No, but this story is interesting to me.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:15.860]   Because I know people that just get on these things and they just glue to it.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:20.060]   It's like, and maybe it's not addictive in some sense that they didn't exist.
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:21.860]   They wouldn't be having to shake.
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:22.860]   So here's the methodology.
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:25.740]   They interviewed 843 people about the Internet and habits.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:31.940]   Found 132 of them exhibited "problematic behavior" and how they handled the online medium.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.460]   So much so that all their thoughts revolve around the Internet during the day and they
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:40.860]   feel like their well-being is severely impacted if they have to go without it.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:41.860]   No?
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:42.860]   Not me.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:44.500]   Yeah, you like to go camping, fishing, honey?
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.500]   For sure.
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.500]   Use a lot of cash.
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.900]   I was just out of the country a week ago and didn't miss the Internet.
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:49.900]   How about you?
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:54.300]   Well, because of my business, I have to pretty much be checked in a lot.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:58.140]   But I don't go on, I don't have a four-square Pinterest, I don't do that.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.660]   I don't have a Facebook account.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:00.660]   I think that's right there.
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:03.740]   I'm now exempt from all the criticism.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.660]   I tweet once in a while.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.660]   I tweet.
[01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:07.660]   How about you, Jolie Odell?
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:08.660]   Uh-huh.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:09.660]   I tweet too.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:10.660]   Once in a while.
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:12.220]   No, she doesn't.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.220]   She does not do chili.
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.220]   She does tweet.
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:15.220]   She has tweet.
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.220]   I do.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.220]   I do have Twitter.
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:18.220]   I use Twitter.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.220]   I use it.
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.220]   It's a fucking Sherry Vinegar.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.220]   So here's the deal.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.800]   Is this where you've gone now?
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.800]   No, I saw this in there.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.800]   It's not open.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.800]   It's a downhill stall.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:29.380]   And I'm always scrounging various bottles of weird stuff and stuff.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.400]   Why do we have Sherry Vinegar?
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.220]   I see you won't miss it.
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:33.220]   Oh, I know.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:34.560]   Dr. Mom sent us that.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:39.780]   Dr. Mom sent us a... for reasons I don't really understand, because she lives in Long Island,
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:42.000]   a case of stuff from Spain.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000]   That's what this would be from.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000]   Spanish Spanish.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.060]   And you probably have to tell you you won't like it.
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:48.340]   No, go ahead and take it.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:49.180]   Thank you.
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:54.300]   John really doesn't feel like his job here has done until he's found something you could
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.300]   steal.
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:56.300]   And that's stealing.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.300]   I always get permission.
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.300]   You always...
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.300]   You do.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.300]   Because I can't say...
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:01.300]   I can't say no to you.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:02.300]   I know for sure.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.140]   So a really interesting article in The New York Times this morning, The Sunday Times,
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:11.980]   about elections in which he says that journalists are missing the boat in their election coverage.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:12.980]   I'm going to see if I...
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:13.980]   That would surprise me.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:23.100]   He says, "The journalists basically are like...
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:27.340]   He uses a chess analogy, like level three chess players compared to the campaigns that
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.340]   are like level eight.
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:30.660]   They are at such a higher strategic level.
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:37.860]   And the reason is, campaigns are now using big data and know so much about what they're
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:38.860]   doing.
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:43.960]   And journalists are still back here thinking, "Oh, it's like they're going after Hispanic
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:44.960]   voters."
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.660]   That is not it at all.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:50.900]   They're going after Jim Beam drinking Northern Calif...
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:54.260]   You know, they've got it down to a science.
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:59.660]   Bloomberg Business Week subscribing people who drink martinis three times a week and
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:01.140]   are likely to vote.
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:04.720]   I mean, they know this match and this is what you're talking about with the cash.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:11.260]   They know so much about these people that they are highly targeting exactly to this
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:12.460]   audience.
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:15.560]   And it started with George W. Bush and Carl Rove.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.560]   And it has been highly refined.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:19.320]   You don't think it goes back further than that?
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.040]   Well, you know, I was thinking about Nixon.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.040]   It was the first to use an ad agency in his campaign.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.040]   Remember, that was like a big thing.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.120]   Oh, he's using an ad agency.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.880]   All of Nixon's campaign staff came from advertising, came from Madison Avenue.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.720]   Now it's the geeks...
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:41.680]   Well, I think somebody in the chatroom, Crimson, as I recall, says the real problem is that
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.980]   the journalists today are mostly stenographers.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:45.060]   Well, that's true.
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:46.500]   That's a problem in general.
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:50.940]   Well, this election cycle, there's been a lot of fact checking, which is...
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.700]   No, it's a meme fact checking.
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.700]   They're not checking anything.
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.060]   They're not really checking.
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:56.060]   No, this is like a...
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:01.020]   This is a veneer of crap that they're putting on top of with the coverage and saying, "Wow,
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:03.180]   we checked this fact and that fact."
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.580]   And there's a lot of subtext that they don't check facts on.
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:06.580]   I mean, this...
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:10.300]   Don't you want to know if the politicians are making up history in their speeches?
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:11.300]   They all make a picture.
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:12.300]   They all lie.
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:13.300]   But I mean, for example, let's take...
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:14.540]   I don't want to go into it.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:16.440]   No agenda type of thing here.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.440]   But Paul...
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.440]   What's that?
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.440]   Is that a show you...
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.440]   Yeah, it's on twice a week.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.440]   What's the URL for that one?
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.440]   At noagendashow.com.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.680]   It's on Thursdays.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:24.680]   Live.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.680]   We stream live, by the way.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.680]   Really?
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.680]   We got that idea from you.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.680]   Really?
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:30.680]   And then we stream live on Sunday mornings.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.680]   And nine o'clock, Pacific time.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.560]   And we talk about these sorts of things.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.840]   So Paul Ryan apparently came out...
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.840]   The big statement...
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.340]   This presidential nominee for the Republican Party.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.980]   Who looks like he's 12.
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:43.980]   But that's beside the point.
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:44.980]   He does.
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:45.980]   He's very clean cut.
[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:46.980]   Very young looking young.
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:49.620]   Apparently an Andrandy, and two of you want to submerge his country.
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:53.060]   Well, but that's interesting because Andrandy was a atheist.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.060]   But he's a Catholic?
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.060]   He's a Catholic.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.220]   Doesn't believe in that.
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:58.020]   Doesn't believe in not believing.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:03.220]   So he says something about Obama coming to us to our little assembly plan and he promised
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:04.700]   it would never close.
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:08.440]   And he says, "And now the place is closed and they've never reopened it."
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.000]   And so everyone jumps on him for saying that, "Well, yeah, it closed, but it closed during
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   the Bush administration."
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   Right.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]   Well, okay.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000]   So now you have to know...
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   So that's the fact check.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.600]   The fact check veneer comes out and says, "That, that."
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.600]   See?
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:21.600]   Gotcha.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.600]   But it wasn't a lie.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.800]   Obama did come out and promise it was always going to be open.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.240]   Whether or not Bush would close during Bush or not.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.240]   So it was like...
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.560]   Well, how could he promise it was always going to be open if it had already closed?
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.320]   No, it would close shortly after he left.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.320]   I see.
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.860]   But inside the point, this is a veneer of kind of looks like fact check.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.980]   Well, and then there's also the kind of a gotcha thing.
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:42.700]   For instance, Ryan said he ran a two-minute, two-hour, 50-minute marathon.
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.820]   And in fact, it wasn't that.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:46.260]   That would be very fast.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.900]   But that's in there.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:48.900]   He ran it in 1992.
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.900]   Well, this is like Obama when he says there's 58 states or whatever.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:52.900]   I mean, this was obviously just a bill.
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:53.900]   Yeah.
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:54.900]   This is a lot of gotcha stuff.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.700]   And I think the problem is it's very hard to complex.
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:58.620]   It's very hard to cover.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:03.920]   But the Anish Jill-up popularity content.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:06.040]   They don't do these speeches off the cuff.
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.160]   They could write facts into their speeches.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.260]   We do it in journalism.
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:10.560]   They can do it into their speeches.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.760]   Well, I don't know about the hum-long...
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.120]   He was reading from a script when he said he ran that marathon in X numbers.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.120]   Well, that was in an interview.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.200]   Okay, well, so that's different.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.120]   The other thing I think was...
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:24.520]   I could say you could argue it was misleading, but it wasn't inaccurate.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.400]   So there's no fact-checking involved.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.560]   Right.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.340]   And then there's Jonah Lehrer.
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.340]   Who?
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.780]   Something people don't like to talk about.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:34.060]   Kind of feels bad, doesn't it?
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.060]   He's science writers.
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.060]   Yeah.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:39.420]   Wrote for The New Yorker, Wired magazine apparently.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.020]   Kind of ass fail.
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:42.020]   Big con and ass fail.
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:45.260]   He's been not only plagiarizing himself.
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:47.340]   Well, you can't play designer.
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:48.340]   It's a minor.
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:49.340]   It's called recycling.
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:50.900]   It's a minor Bible attraction.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:51.900]   I quote myself.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:53.540]   Sometimes there's nobody else worth a crap.
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:54.540]   I agree.
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:55.540]   I have to quote myself.
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:59.000]   And he's also done a little bit of plagiarizing, a little bit of fabrication.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000]   There's no...
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.120]   Your mark knows this.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:02.920]   It's not that hard to write.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.920]   Make up some new stuff.
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:05.920]   I mean, you don't have to...
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:06.920]   Make up some new crap.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:07.920]   You don't have to...
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:08.920]   Oh, this is the nice paragraph.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:09.920]   I'm going to steal it.
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.920]   I'm going to re...
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:11.920]   Come on.
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.920]   You know, this is not the...
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:15.920]   I like this.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.700]   Wolfram Alpha has now... does... is doing analytics on your Facebook page.
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:22.700]   Have you tried this yet?
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:25.240]   I don't use Facebook, so I have no idea.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.240]   You know what Wolfram Alpha is.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.500]   Yeah, a great one of the... these guys are amazing.
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.580]   A mathematician, genius, says...
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.580]   So if I... Facebook... what is it?
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.980]   Facebook, now I've forgotten.
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:38.980]   Facebook... oh, I'm going to have to look at that.
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:39.980]   Hey, go to...
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:40.980]   Hey, hit that one.
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.820]   It's at Facebook versus Twitter.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.820]   Facebook versus Twitter.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:44.820]   Right.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:45.820]   I'm typing it again.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:46.820]   Let's see.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.920]   Facebook... oh, this is one of the things Wolfram Alpha does is really great.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.020]   You could take two companies.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.460]   You know, Yahoo versus Google.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:52.460]   Facebook...
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.460]   I still have it for you.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.460]   What?
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.460]   Facebook versus the port.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.460]   I think is the search.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460]   Twitter.
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:58.460]   Facebook versus the port.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:59.460]   No, no, Facebook.
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:00.460]   Facebook.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.360]   And so it gives you company information.
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:04.200]   So I give Facebook report.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200]   That's right.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.000]   So this is just two companies compared.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.100]   But for investors, this would be good.
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:09.100]   I love Wolfram Alpha.
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:10.100]   This guy's brilliant.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.640]   Yeah, you know, we don't use it enough.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.640]   We should use it more.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.640]   Generally speaking the book.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640]   Look at this.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640]   Facebook report.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   Now you have to give it...
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:17.640]   It's built in Siri now.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.740]   If people use Siri, they'd be using it.
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:19.820]   That's right.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:21.480]   So you have to say analyze my Facebook data.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.480]   And you have to log into Facebook.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:28.040]   Real quickly, we'll do this.
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:29.220]   And give it permission.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:31.220]   And it does an analysis.
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:37.660]   It says loading my data from Facebook.
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:38.660]   It's actually loading it.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.420]   You don't feel uncomfortable about this right now.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.260]   Like what it might say about me.
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:44.260]   Yeah, I just say you just uploaded...
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:45.260]   I had to go from...
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:46.980]   Yeah, just good move, John.
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:48.460]   Take it off the screen.
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:49.460]   Just in case.
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:50.460]   No, but I'm just saying.
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:51.460]   You know, I'm not paranoid.
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:52.460]   I don't care.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:53.460]   People can get...
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:54.460]   It's all public information.
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.460]   I don't hide my Facebook page.
[01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:01.460]   And the other thing is I don't think Stephen Wolfram really wants to do anything with my
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:02.460]   stuff.
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.460]   You think he's selling my stuff?
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:04.460]   It's interesting.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:05.460]   You think he's like selling this?
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.460]   Like there's some...
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.460]   I doubt it.
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:08.460]   Something's doing on that?
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:09.460]   It's very cool.
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:12.300]   So look, he's going to give me a whole bunch of information about my...
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.300]   It's analyzing this.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:14.300]   This is good.
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:15.500]   This may take a while actually.
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:16.500]   I should have taken too long a little bit.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:17.500]   I did it yesterday.
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.700]   And I probably should have done it again before the show.
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:22.300]   to just cast it, yeah.
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.640]   - No, no, it's almost done.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:24.960]   Here it goes.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.660]   Facebook report for me, Leo Laport.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:30.560]   How old I am, when my next birthday hometown.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.300]   Here's some interesting stuff.
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.360]   - Yeah, lots of charts.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.800]   - Charts. When I uploaded stuff.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:38.620]   Photos, videos, pasted link status I do a lot more photos
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:40.220]   than I do anything else.
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:42.040]   80% photos.
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.140]   Time of the week that I do it.
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:46.940]   - Well, wiggle back, back, back, back, back.
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:48.480]   What are these times?
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.860]   - It's the day that we can do that.
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:50.860]   - A lot of work at three in the morning.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:54.500]   - Yeah, three AM on Sundays.
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:57.300]   I am constantly posting stuff.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:59.700]   - And it looks like you were not doing anything at midnight,
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:03.980]   so you get up at three in the morning and start working.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:07.420]   - I am working hard for you, John.
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:09.540]   We click app, these are the apps you use.
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:10.380]   - You use spider-man?
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.460]   - Smug, mud, splice.
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:14.220]   - Socialite, motion XGPS.
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:16.380]   Incredibooth, what's Incredibooth?
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:18.060]   - It's a photo booth app.
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:18.900]   - No.
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:19.720]   - Oh.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:24.280]   - By the way, I know 61% of my friends are men,
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:27.580]   38% women, most of them involuntary.
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:29.660]   Let's see.
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:33.480]   Relationship status, I know mostly married people.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:34.840]   - A lot of engaged.
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.720]   - A few other, I don't know what other is.
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.060]   Here's the age distribution.
[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:40.680]   Tim Street has said it on Facebook
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.760]   that he's 83 years old, he's not.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:44.120]   He said he's about 40.
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.560]   - So this is Bogative already.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.600]   - Bogative.
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.600]   - And Luis Alavera is the youngest person I know.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:50.760]   - You go back, back, back, back, back, back.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.960]   - He says he's 14, he's not.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.800]   - Back, back, back, back.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:54.920]   - What's Barlow doing on there?
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.400]   - John Perry Barlow is my third oldest friend.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.240]   And if you take the fake Tim Street off,
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.440]   he's actually the second oldest friend,
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.640]   right after Harry Fuller.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.320]   So that's just, you know, I think that's fun.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.440]   - What's so fun about it?
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.540]   What's even useful about this?
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:11.800]   - 179 of my friends are in the US,
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:14.960]   10 are in Canada, three are in the UK, two are in France.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:19.960]   - My political views, oh, it says what my political views are.
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.760]   - Be liberal in what you accept
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:23.640]   and conservative in what you said.
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:24.480]   - Send.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:25.320]   - Send.
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:27.160]   - That's more about the internet than it's about.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.640]   - Avoid them, especially when they make no sense.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.560]   - I don't know what that's,
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:34.000]   I have no idea where this is coming from.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.200]   Apparently I'm both atheistic and Catholic.
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.440]   - Yeah, well, it can happen.
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:43.520]   Eight of my friends are named Jennifer, seven are named Dan.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.840]   And you are the best friends with most people
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.400]   that are best friends with Jim Lauterback.
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:52.000]   - And Jim Lauterback matches my social graph most closely.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.040]   I don't know why that is.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.760]   - That's pretty peculiar.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.760]   - Anyway, I thought that was cool, you can try.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.040]   So you go to Wolfram Alpha, you say Facebook report,
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.840]   you give them every bit of information
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.560]   that Facebook knows about you,
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.080]   and you sit back and enjoy.
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.400]   - And I'm sure the NSA is enjoying it too.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.880]   - I don't care, the NSA knows everything about me anyway.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.400]   What have I got to hide?
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.920]   - Nothing, it's not the point.
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:19.880]   - You just be private just because?
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.600]   - Yeah, there's a lot of good reasons
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.040]   for privacy to exist and because here's the problem.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:28.040]   It's not about you, it's not about me,
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.640]   it's not about oh, I have never do anything wrong,
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.160]   so why should I give a crap?
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.280]   It's about the fact that maybe somebody
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:36.000]   who does something wrong happens to be a legislative person
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.640]   and maybe he's married to somebody
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:39.080]   and he's actually gay.
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:40.280]   And he doesn't want anyone to know this
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.880]   'cause he knows he's gonna get kicked out of office
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.720]   or they find out 'cause they were a bunch of anti-gays
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.560]   in this area.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.840]   So they find out about it because the privacy laws
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.960]   are lax enough and then they blackmail the guy,
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:51.760]   so he's voting against your interests.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:53.520]   - Oh, I get it.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.480]   - And that's why you have broccoli cash?
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.080]   - That's why we should never allow gay members of Congress.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:46:59.920]   - Right?
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.160]   - Yeah, that's one way of analyzing it.
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.640]   If you're completely nuts.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:06.960]   - Hey, you know, if you missed this week,
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:09.520]   did you know that we had rappers on,
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.120]   right here, where you're sitting right now?
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:12.760]   - Who's rappers or hip hop artists?
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:13.800]   - Hip hop artists.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:14.640]   Take a look.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.480]   - It's different.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:18.640]   - Previously on "Twit" and "SFW."
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:21.240]   ♪ Did you tell 'em now that you've had a hit the ground ♪

[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:41.800]   - This guy was interesting.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.760]   - It's basically a service where lazy reporters go on
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.440]   and they say, "Hey, I need a source for this story
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:49.960]   "I'm doing about boats."
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.920]   And someone says, "I'll be your story as long as..."
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:53.360]   - Do you ever see that helper reporter out?
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.440]   - I mentioned my boat in the house.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.280]   - Yeah, why?
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.120]   - I was in jail.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:56.960]   - I mentioned my boat sales weather.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:57.800]   - He posed.
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:47:58.640]   - Windows, week.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:47:59.720]   - As an expert, and all these different fields.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:00.560]   - Look at that.
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:01.400]   - Paul and shorts.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:02.240]   - I know this story.
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.080]   - Paul, put your pants on.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:03.920]   (laughing)
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.600]   Paul, I hear one joke going on.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.120]   I just came out of the closet.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.480]   - In shorts.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.200]   - In shorts.
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:11.440]   - All about Android.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.480]   - Hello.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.600]   - Is that work?
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.080]   - When do you reach or the pee?
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.440]   - Whoa.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.080]   - Show the toothpits.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:20.920]   - Right there.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:21.760]   - It's a party.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.600]   - Hey.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:23.680]   (laughing)
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.520]   - This is a Disney children show.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:27.160]   - Apparently it's an alarm clock.
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.000]   - It's a swim clock.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.560]   - With you missed a lot.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:30.400]   (dramatic music)
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.240]   - Hey, hold on a second.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.080]   - What?
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.080]   That was a house ad.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.520]   - That's just what I was gonna say.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.160]   - Yeah, 'cause you say it every time.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.000]   - Oh, I don't.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:38.840]   It's a house ad.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.400]   What are you running house ads on your own network for?
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:43.120]   - 'Cause nobody apparently knows
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:45.280]   that we have all these other great shows.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.720]   - Works for a second. - But you can watch.
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.800]   Zynga does that.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:48.960]   - Zynga's big on house ads.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:50.320]   - Play other games.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:51.280]   If you like-- - Yeah, they try out
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.720]   the NBC as well. - The NBC as well.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.680]   - 'Cause they can't see any. - Everybody does that.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.240]   - Would you, did you have to pull a real ad for that?
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.960]   'Cause it seems like money get thrown away.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:01.080]   - No, no, no, no, no, believe me.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:01.920]   (laughing)
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:05.280]   That's an extra, I added an extra unit.
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.760]   It's called self promotion.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.160]   Hey, we're at a time.
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.800]   I guess Jolie's not gonna show up.
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:13.560]   - She's gonna be mad about this, by the way.
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:14.600]   I guarantee it. - I feel terrible.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:16.440]   - I don't know what happened.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.720]   - Yeah, miscommunication.
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:19.000]   - It must've been a miscommunication.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]   'Cause you're right, she's very conscientious.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:21.840]   - Yes.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.960]   And she also gets--
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:24.880]   - Did I say anything?
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.160]   You were here last time she was here.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.480]   Did I say anything? - No, no, no, no.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.840]   I guarantee she doesn't know about this.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.040]   I guarantee it.
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:33.960]   - I bet you're right.
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.440]   - Yeah. - Oh, I feel bad.
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:36.880]   Great that you showed up though.
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:39.200]   'Cause then otherwise she'd be me in this crackpot over here.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:40.360]   - Yeah. - I'm the buzzkill.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.560]   - That's up to say that straight.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:45.480]   - Mark Millian is at Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.760]   Really, actually, I am gonna subscribe to this.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.360]   After going through this week's edition, it's weekly, right?
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:52.200]   - Yep. - Yeah, after going
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.240]   through this week's edition, I feel like
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:55.320]   this actually is better than the Economist
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.000]   in terms of raw information.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.920]   Apple versus Samsung, the longer view, things like that.
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:04.480]   This is, the problem is that if you read the dailies
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:06.200]   or you read the blogs, you get just kind of--
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.040]   - You don't get perspective.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:07.880]   - You don't get perspective.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:09.560]   This is like analysis, this is perspective,
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.480]   this is understanding.
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:14.440]   And that's what I need 'cause I don't understand a thing.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.000]   John C. Devorak, channeldevorak.com.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.360]   - Calm. - Devorak.org/blog
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.600]   and no agenda show. - No agenda, yeah.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:24.760]   - Is no agenda like the...
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.560]   - Well, one of these days you're about--
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:30.600]   - The success story of the internet.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.120]   - I think so.
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:33.960]   It's the greatest podcast in the universe.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.680]   - It is the greatest podcast in the universe.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:37.400]   - Like we are like an audio podcast
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.600]   and you've lost your way because you've done this video thing.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.280]   - I have, it's too fancy now.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:44.880]   You're simple. - We're very simple.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:46.920]   - You ask people for money, they give you money,
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.920]   it's it, that's done, it's your finish.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.880]   Now you can enjoy yourself.
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.200]   - We do a lot of work.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.360]   - Do you have ads?
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.480]   - No. - You don't need ads
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.840]   because people give you money.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.040]   - They support the show.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.040]   - They're producers.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:00.040]   - Yes, exactly. - Stuff like that.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:00.960]   - You got it.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.360]   That's the way it works.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.920]   It's a model that's--
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.840]   - Well last week I asked Adam,
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:06.680]   did you make a lot of money?
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.320]   He said it supports two families.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.000]   But what about you?
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.400]   - I got to support about six families apparently.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.640]   - I'm just gonna say, yeah.
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.160]   (laughing)
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.120]   - So I have to do other work.
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.280]   - No agenda show.com.
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.120]   - It's a very nice show.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:19.960]   - Check it out.
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:21.640]   People that listen to your show would like our show.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:22.600]   - Apparently so.
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:23.440]   - Yeah.
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:24.360]   - Apparently there's a great overlap.
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:27.760]   - If it wasn't for you, our show would be one tenth the size.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.080]   - That's what Curry said.
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.800]   - Yeah, I think that's true. - I want to cut.
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.920]   - That's too late.
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.240]   - You should ask earlier.
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.240]   - We offered it to you.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:35.080]   - You did?
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.480]   - But you forgot just like the other things
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.680]   you've been forgetting apparently.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:40.960]   - Thank you all for being here later.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.800]   - We do to a 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern time,
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.960]   2200 UTC on Twit.TV.
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.440]   Do watch live 'cause it's great every Sunday afternoon.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:51.040]   We love having you here.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.880]   And if you can't, we make on demand audio and video
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:57.200]   available after the fact at Twit.TV.
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:00.720]   If you're in the Northern California area,
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:04.080]   and please stop by, there's a parade every single week.
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:05.720]   - Apparently, every single week.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.880]   - This town is out of control.
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.120]   - We love our-- - We love our people to get in.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:09.720]   - We love our parades.
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:11.320]   It's wonderful if you come visit us.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.680]   Just email tickets@twit.tv
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:16.400]   and we will make sure that you get directions
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.960]   and the secret code to the door.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:19.920]   That's our security.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:21.320]   - Park a mile and a half away?
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:22.160]   - Yeah.
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:25.280]   - How, were you all able to find parking nearby?
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.200]   - Yeah, that garage, next door is right.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.720]   - They parked 10 blocks away.
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:29.560]   - Oh, well you did.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.440]   - But they got here earlier before the parade.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:32.600]   - Oh yeah, no, that was--
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:33.440]   - Now it's empty.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.240]   You can park right in front
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.800]   'cause everybody left 'cause the parade's over.
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:36.640]   - Yeah.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.000]   - Next week, it'll be bad.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.360]   - What's next week?
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.360]   - Something bad.
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.800]   - Something other parade.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:42.880]   We like our parades.
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.560]   (laughing)
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:47.160]   I, parades are the greatest though, don't you think?
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.000]   - Yeah, a lot of fun.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.840]   - Yeah.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:49.680]   - Parades and farmers markets.
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:52.120]   That's what keeps Petal and Buffalo.
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.560]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:54.480]   We appreciate it.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:56.600]   Everybody in the studio, everybody watching at home.
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:57.560]   We'll see you next week.
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.360]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.920]   (applause)
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.520]   (applause)
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:06.360]   - Do it.
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:07.200]   - All right.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.760]   - Do it, look, do it, baby.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.600]   Do it, do it.
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:10.440]   - All right.
