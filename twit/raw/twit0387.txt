[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.240]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech to show the covers of the week's Tech
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.080]   News and we have this week our CES preview and I thought it'd be good to bring
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.360]   in some old hands CES starting with this guy right here John C. de Vorak.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.840]   Hey everybody. Hi John. Hey Leo. Who is are you going to see yeses? No. No. Isn't that great?
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.600]   John celebrates not going to go. John's gonna mess of a show that is kind of a
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.200]   nightmare. But if you see me there say hi. You know Jerry Pournell went a couple
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.640]   of years ago I thought it was your big return to CES I take it that was
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:49.880]   enough. Hey Jerry. I try that bang bang bang bang. Now I've got people going and I
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.520]   don't have to. Yeah I have lookalikes going. Yeah do you? I don't have a look alike but I
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.960]   got a son there. Yeah Alex Alex he's working. Yeah. An activity for a lot of the
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.760]   peep shows. She does the showstoppers I know. Yeah and when you say peep shows
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.760]   you're not talking about girls. Yeah that's what he's talking about. That's what
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.640]   Alex loves. He loves those peep shows. Also with us he's already in Vegas. He's
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.720]   going Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends in Vegas and that's he's in a
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.360]   hotel. He's in a hotel in Vegas. Yeah I just got to the hotel. Yeah John I mean
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.040]   last year I was it last year John every every five minutes I saw John at the
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.320]   alcohol counter at one of the events. Was it last year every time we walked around
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.960]   and go to some different booths and we'd be back and John and I kept running
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.440]   into each other and he ran into a jet away a bit. He said see that bottle of
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.880]   scotch back there. They shouldn't even have this out here. I'm not going to tell
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.120]   you that they have this bottle of scotch out here. You need to go get it. You
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.400]   need to ask them for it. So he just we just covered around this bottle I think
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   for like wow wow. Well we're having we're hovering a bar in bottle scotch now but
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.560]   you're not here so we can't share. Yeah it's a shame. Wish we could. So Clayton do
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.040]   they make you go to CES is that why you're there? You know I kind of they don't
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.840]   really make me I offer it up and to me it ends up being you know I think a lot
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.360]   of people sort of look down on the show lately I think but I mean really a lot
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.200]   of the stuff that ends up driving my coverage for the rest of the year I
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.480]   end up seeing for the first time here and sort of informs my decision stuff I'm
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.280]   going to cover over the summer into the fall certainly the holiday season I think
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.600]   I did like 15 different segments during the holidays and I have to say most of
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.960]   those different devices and gadgets save for a few Apple devices here and
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.600]   there were all launched at CES this past year. It is a one-stop shot like
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.200]   what? Like what? Let's see let's roll back through some of the home automation
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.720]   stuff we got to see some of the nest stuff. I love nest that is so cool. Some of
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.080]   the stuff from iHome let's see somebody you know some of the docking station. I'll tell
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.640]   you one thing we saw last year that we never did see the OLED TVs from LG and
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.800]   Samsung they never shipped them. Right. I should have one there today. It is
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.280]   interesting if you run down like sort of the laundry list of things that you
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.840]   that are announced at CES and that you never end up actually seeing more than
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.960]   half of you. Absolutely and I think about all the Android tablets we were
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.440]   promised and all the things that we're going to take off it was going to be the
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.760]   year of the tablet last year and it really ironically what we didn't see
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.000]   much of is Windows 8 tablets last year. Right. So we'll probably see a couple of
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.400]   those. I mean there's going to be a whole bunch of things that I'm
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.560]   interested in seeing of course we'll see the TVs and right there's going to
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.320]   someone's going to release one of those giant televisions they always try to
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.840]   out do each other every year by two inches. Westinghouse has a hundred ten inch
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:44.400]   4k display Westinghouse. What the hell. They call it Westinghouse Digital so
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.520]   there is a Westinghouse that still makes appliances and I presume that's the
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.360]   original Westinghouse and then there's Westinghouse Digital which makes just
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.000]   TVs and I'm figuring that's a Korean or a Chinese or something. I think it's
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.480]   Korean isn't it. I'm not dead sure but I know it's not George Westinghouse's
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.080]   old company. They are they're headquartered in Orange California though.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.120]   I don't know if they're but I've got to think they're making they're they're
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.440]   kind of the house TVs for a lot of big box stores things like that right. Yeah I
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.320]   have the press release from the EEG awards which I'll load up here and we
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.560]   can talk about the specific award winners for the CEO show even though the
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.160]   show is even that's what that's the other thing that gets me is they all have
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.200]   these badges winner C. E. S. Innovation Award 2013 they've they're already
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.000]   awarded all the award show hasn't even started till Tuesday officially we have
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.760]   the press night tonight so the big unveiled event that I like to go to the
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.640]   smaller events at night where I can really interact with some of the company
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.200]   spend some some time with these different gadgets see if it's going to make it on
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.560]   my air eventually so but you know those press events take place two nights ahead
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.400]   of the show even launching so I've got to get out here two days before I show
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.280]   even start in fact most of our coverage of C. E. S. is going to be the C. E. S.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.080]   unveiled event tonight Robert Baliser will be there Dicty Bartolo will be at
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.880]   the digital experience tomorrow night the so-called peep shows that Jerry was
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.440]   talking about and showstoppers on Tuesday night with Dicty Bartolo be there
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.720]   that's that's like 90% of our coverage but that's the kind of seems kind of
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.280]   unfair because that's at most a hundred hundred fifty products that pay an extra
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.760]   fifteen grand just to be at these peep shows right or some that don't even go
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.040]   to the main show I know last year when we were a pepcom I think you know me I
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.280]   don't know if you were you there last year Leo I mean it was a year before
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.400]   we're gonna ask that question that's a sense of actually about you get me started
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.920]   he was black bald they were apple they wouldn't let me in because that was
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.040]   that you had the you had the bet yeah because it's God knows that you can
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.840]   don't have any coverage they wouldn't let me in I think we screwed up because we
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.440]   had a bunch of people in there and I think they said oh no you've got too
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.680]   many people from twit in here eating our food shows and eating our food and so
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.040]   the food yeah it's for them it's for some reason showstoppers Stephen Leon's
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.880]   always very nice but for some reasons digital experience it's like their
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.000]   garden that Fort Knox in there and I think it's the food I really do I think
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   I got kicked out of ice snuck in early that during that year that
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.360]   Clayton's referring to somehow I got in I snuck in because some
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.960]   guard was looking the wrong way so I got in there the whole thing was filled
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.280]   with the vendors and I started going around from vendor to vendor getting
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.520]   some early coverage because there wasn't anybody else in awesome then I got
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.400]   kicked out yeah because the I robot people turned me in what why would you
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.800]   tell me I don't get it what I was gonna give him a good ride up and then
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.080]   get into them they're not there now black bald one of those rumors got your
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.920]   sock and I guess everything has changed I of course I
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.960]   my major experiences with these things were back in Condeck's days when I used
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.640]   to give the best of show award and I didn't notice any problems with people
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:07.320]   why you know what how why did see a yes surviving Condeck's not well I think
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.520]   it's a children made so dang much money out of it said he turned to something
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.080]   else no I know they put him in debt when when they sold it and sold it and sold
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.720]   it a couple times more there was so much of a debt load they couldn't keep the
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.360]   thing going without going broke so it wasn't lack of interest the killed
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.680]   convex it was just mismanagement it no it was not it was finances it was a
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.120]   financial problem wasn't really a management issue CES will get they say
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.880]   150,000 attendees is low actually so I mean it's clearly flourishing I just I
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.400]   just wonder why we need it in the internet age why do we need a consumer
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.560]   electronics now it's not that we it's not and maybe it's not that we need it and
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.800]   I'm certainly I get a lot of great coverage and it's great for me to to see
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   these things up up close and to sort of make these relationships for for later
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.720]   on so that I can feature different things and work with different companies and
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.600]   see what they have to offer down the line for context but really it's for them
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.160]   right I mean it's to make the deals in the back rooms and to have the lunches
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160]   right and to make but do they need to do that do they need to do that in person
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.080]   I guess maybe they do I mean it's it's the same thing that Ted you know the the
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.720]   famous analogy of the Ted talks right it's that yes they can put it out there for
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.000]   free online so that we all we can all enjoy the Ted talks but to be in that
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.840]   room to pay the ticket to go to a Ted talk yourself I mean you're in the hall
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.480]   with Al Gore having you know Robin Elbows was with with Bill Gates and by the
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.880]   way you can pay twice as much and El Gore won't be there
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.520]   the special Al Gore free Ted yes that's that's a lot people don't know about
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.440]   that one yeah it's costly
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.920]   well I mean obviously you know I'm going I'm gonna leave after the show I'm
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.040]   flying out there but I'm going to new media Expo I'm gonna speak there and give
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.000]   the podcast awards then I'm going to do some work for Stitcher at the Ford
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.560]   booth and I'll wander around Stitcher Stitcher's a podcast app you should know
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.000]   about it oh yeah sure they have no agenda I hope so
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.440]   hope so yeah Stitcher's great yeah Stitcher does a lot of stuff for our
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.840]   podcasts and yeah and they are plus are built in I mean now Stitcher's what
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.160]   built in the Ford and that's right that's why they're gonna be there yeah yeah
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   yeah I know I you know I guess I guess it's obviously relevant it's it's
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.040]   thriving I think it's relevant for press apparently relevant for dealers yeah
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   there's enough press there for press people per booth you would I believe
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.200]   that I believe that yeah number well that of course is because unless they've
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:41.520]   changed things a lot anybody who had a web camera was a prayer it was fresh
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:48.160]   bloggers are press so I mean I can remember a couple of years ago going to
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.200]   it and getting to an Intel press conference at 730 in the morning and I
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   couldn't get in yeah because it was full yeah the halls were full outside of
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.760]   people with press badges yeah yeah I don't know anymore yeah one reason I don't
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.120]   go anymore because of everybody's press than nobody's first here's what gets me
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:16.240]   the the insulting press badge nowadays in a lot of these events says press slash
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.280]   blogger you don't like that well I think is you're your pressure your
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.880]   a lot of sound like the old school I see blogger and my thing I love it
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:35.920]   I said 90 people the verge is setting 60 90 90 people why work there I know well
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.840]   let's CBS money now we're talking yeah it's it's certainly a big event for the
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.360]   press and yet Microsoft isn't gonna be there for the first time ever no keynote
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.440]   from Microsoft Microsoft said that we're gonna do our own thing in October
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.800]   announced Windows 8 we don't need to go to CES you got to wonder how long before
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.040]   Samsung decides we don't they've they already said we're not announcing any
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.480]   phones is Sony gonna be there Sony is there I'm sure they were there last year
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.240]   with their what they have the worst slogan ever they were they're good at
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:10.440]   that make dot believe do you I we had a dog named dot it's about making that
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.800]   believe Sony has a gigantic booth and they show TVs and stuff cannons there
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:24.520]   Samsung's there LG Panasonic it really is has become it a TV HD TV camera I mean
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.480]   and of course emerging a camera shows into this and I don't think there gonna
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.960]   be any pro cameras announced there it's all I mean if anything they're pointing
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.620]   shoots or right right and it will be some interesting I'm curious what

[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.000]   right now and so you're seeing Android and a lot of different cameras and but

[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.900]   shown at the show in 2012 he came out yeah but the Hugo is a 2011 movie but I
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:00.180]   guess it is no okay with it within the Blu-ray disc or something right here yeah
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.500]   and any event let's talk about share file comment if you have been trying to
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:09.420]   share large files over the internet maybe you started by emailing them and you
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:16.220]   get the bounce backs crazy maybe you've been trying to I don't know use one of
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.780]   the commercial file sharing programs fine but I have to say you can run in
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:27.260]   trouble I used to use one of the other programs and I had a guy this is how I
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.620]   used to share their the commercials on the radio show with the radio stations
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.180]   and the guy I was sharing it with would we just delete it and I say you can
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.300]   know you can't delete it because it deletes it for everybody else's no I just
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.140]   taken up space in my heart I'm going to delete it just it didn't work so finally
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.540]   I found share file from Citrix and I had to say this is the way to share files
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:50.300]   no email bands backs it's secure so it complies with regulations and almost

[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:34.180]   for their support I guess Westinghouse digital in the chat room they tell me is
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:39.660]   licensed from Westinghouse which is owned by CBS yeah the name is licensed and so
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.820]   there's a Westinghouse licensing and they licensed the name out via CBS I
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.020]   didn't know CBS owned Westinghouse but it makes sense yeah yeah yeah all right so
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:54.380]   let's say before we wrap completely on the CES story it's Clayton is there
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.980]   anything you're particularly looking for this year I do want to see this whatever
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.860]   Samsung's going to be this television that's the one I'm interested in because
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.780]   what is what is it gonna be right and there's been a lot of speculation online
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.380]   as to what it's gonna be some sort of transparent screen which seems asinine
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.580]   to me yes because I mean you don't want to look through it all your wires I mean
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.140]   if you see the TV in my house and you're looking through this thing you're gonna
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:24.740]   see surge protectors and Apple TV cores yeah well here's here's what's causing
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.780]   all the interest this is the quote from the invitation you're seeing the picture
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.240]   on your screen a true innovation of TV design coming up with quote an
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:39.460]   unprecedented new TV shape so is it portrait I mean is it going to be I mean
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.780]   which could be cool and I think that yeah I was thinking about this the other
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:46.340]   day as I was playing with my you know the 55 inch Vizio and when you pull in
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.820]   some of the web apps you know it puts it pushes the screen over or you've got
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.100]   the stuff coming up from the bottom and it's all over the screen and then you
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.660]   can't see the picture so maybe that's what they're thinking here I know extra
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:01.140]   no no I don't watch the movie I want the movie to fill the screen I don't want to
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.900]   see anything but the movie no this is for those all the broadcasters out there
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.780]   that are doing those portrait broadcasts that we can't watch yeah right I have
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.180]   not been able to watch one of these not one of them no you know what you know
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.940]   what this is for I just figured it out it's for all of the idiots out there
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.900]   that shoot the iPhone video up and down in portrait mode hey I do that all the
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.620]   time and it's got the black I know it's so stupid I just it it should be it's
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.540]   thumb but I do that yeah we forget but you know I had a yell at my mom about it
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.460]   like how can you stop shooting videos like that if you're gonna post them you
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:38.460]   got these black bars on the side that's what it's for it's for iPhone videos the
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.820]   Samsung iPhone video screen like be interested in your report on this thing
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.060]   because I'd like to see what it was that's the only thing that was so and
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.820]   they're not announcing that I think to Wednesday morning is there press well
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.500]   you got to stay there all week this one yeah this thing yeah what does it start
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.260]   till Tuesday but we're here yeah that's yeah Wednesday morning yeah he's their
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.460]   Sunday Monday Tuesday went jeez also I'm look I'm really excited about the
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.300]   home automation you know I think we've been hearing about it for years I think
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.260]   it's been one of sort of promises see you crap on it John but I think you're
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.620]   crap on it because we have this past few years experience literally crap not
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.580]   seeing anything right or seeing things that are so ridiculously expensive and
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.260]   don't make any sense and don't have any practical use then I saw you know then
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.940]   you start to see the things like the nest you start to see things like the
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:26.460]   wemo from Belkin and which by the way I used for all the wemo I ordered it
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.060]   I haven't gotten mine yet it's great and in fact we used it for our Christmas
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.260]   lights so I set it up so that every day at 4 p.m. Christmas it's outside would
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.100]   turn on and at like 1230 in the morning they would turn off the Christmas tree
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.780]   would go on and for that's astonishing how does it work it's great to because
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.260]   we're a week's and we're a week's
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.900]   how much is that by the way for that special rap plug let me get one of those
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.820]   things you can do anything with it I mean but to me is you can start wrapping
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.580]   your brain about using it for like if this then that stuff so Leo anytime you
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.660]   know someone someone sends you an at-reply on Twitter you can set up a
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:09.780]   recipe on if this then that and have your your bathroom light turn on and off
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:16.780]   I'm trying to get going I want that drink
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.700]   you can even know you're real problem with this is no I have the nest and I
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:26.420]   also have the hue lights from Philips and I'm I ordered a wemo but none of it
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.940]   talks to anything else so you have all basically you have 12 apps on your
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.740]   iPhone that each do something different I mean I can set my thermostat from here
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:42.140]   if I want to I think the two is Siri based home automation I think this year I
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.260]   think we're gonna see quite a theory base now you're just killing you're just
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:50.740]   fooling with us now Siri turn on my lights no the light Siri I think we're
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.420]   gonna see I don't want to watch the fight you know it's a fight turn off the
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:00.860]   fights I want the lights hit a guy had a clapper on he did that was what alerted
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.060]   the burglar we're talking about a video we saw before the show Metro scenes in
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.980]   our chatroom is actually he's gonna be on Fox and friends I think he's been on
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.100]   the today show he's all over the news he's on Reddit he shot he had a home
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:18.540]   automation system and taking pictures and he got the burglars Robin is home and
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.260]   two of the kids have been arrested already but what happened is apparently
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.940]   also had a clapper on the Christmas tree and the kid accidentally turned on the
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.940]   Christmas tree and you can see on the video he jumps and then he starts looking
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.900]   around and then he sees the camera he hides his face and he goes over and he
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.260]   pulls it down yeah so and then apparently they poured bleach in the DVR
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.780]   which did nothing to the hard drive and they they've now been arrested we we
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:49.180]   haven't had good home automation do their parents have any money yeah probably
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.740]   not no of course not but that maybe they'll go to jail and and learn a
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:58.100]   thing or two good descendant of jail but if their parents have any money you
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.580]   can sue them yeah yeah I think he's you almost just put some stuff out on the
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:07.220]   front porch for him and then save you a lot of damage and time here have my wemo
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:13.700]   good luck to you know what I'd like to you know what I'd like to see very much
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:19.540]   Clayton is some sort of agreement on standardization for these things mmm
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.820]   because there isn't any way to kind of universally control them they need they
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:28.300]   need to all be controlled yeah and you can't you can't have certain devices you
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.020]   you know you can't have the nest in one one app that you can control over your
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.860]   home Wi-Fi network with the wemo turning on lights turning up but well there are
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.460]   there are whole packages though now you actually have those people are able to
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.940]   lock their dead bolts now right you know using your using your smartphone so
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.140]   you've got eight you're right you've got eight different apps for eight different
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.140]   things in your house you're accidentally turning on a blender when you meant to
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.580]   you know get the baby monitor up and running and you're waking up the kid
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.460]   here's my thermostat in my house right now it's it knows that I'm away and it's
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:05.100]   an auto away mode but I could if I wanted to I could I could end the away and turn
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.780]   on the heat turn on high speed yeah that's what I just did I got on the flight I
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.580]   had to do the show this morning at 4 a.m. and you know went right from there to
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.020]   the airport and I thought oh crap you know I forgot to I forgot to turn off
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.500]   the thermostat and I did on just when I landed on the plane you know put it on
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.860]   you couldn't have called the nanny and had her do it a nest is a lot cheaper than
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:31.020]   an anti he's got two nannies this guy got two kids planes loaded this guy's loaded
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:37.140]   yeah so I drink old fashions I think the martini's gonna be a better image you
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.580]   make me a martini switch to the martini how old that's actually good question how
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.300]   do your kids have to be before you teach them to make you a martini what is
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.060]   that what state you're in what is the minimum age for that my son now he knows
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.060]   what I'm doing I've quizzed him since he was like under a year I said what is
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.460]   daddy drinking a beer so he'll walk over if there's a beer sitting across the
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.460]   room he'll just go and grab it and walk it over and says here daddy and she
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:04.900]   ends it to me that's the reason to have a great kid yeah is there Jerry are you
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.940]   paying attention to CES at all is there anything that you're interested in
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:15.660]   actually the reason I used to go to these shows is so that I could actually do
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:23.380]   some hands-on stuff of things are gonna release I haven't seen a new tablet that
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:31.380]   is better than the old compact tablet from back in the days when tablets first
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.460]   came out you think the compact you think the compact is better than the iPad
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:43.180]   well no but but it depends if you mean as a full service computer yes the old
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.780]   compact was better of course you got to remember the compact understood my
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:53.340]   handwriting apparently we go again never ends
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.340]   I haven't heard this one I've heard it forever
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.860]   John's in a rare mood just we should everybody just ignore him I should never
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:09.340]   have given him that whiskey and I mean how many tablets do we see last year the
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.900]   year before all these weird transformer tablets rotate they do yoga they do
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.380]   tree pose they do Pilates well you know it's you know it's funny is those are
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.380]   all now gonna be windows eight tablets right yeah they couldn't sell my
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.980]   Android on them right and some with a nice skin it presumably the only real
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.900]   tablet that's doing well you know Kindle fire and the Nexus 7 Jerry what
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.420]   about the what about this surface you know Microsoft isn't gonna be at CES so
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.620]   they won't be showing the surface pro but that's gonna be like that compact I
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.020]   think that's one reason I'm not going I'm waiting to see what the surface is
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:51.260]   gonna look like I have got windows eight on a big high powerful desk desktop I
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:56.500]   mean with a lots of memory and lots of drive and I think I'm gonna convert it
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.660]   back to Windows 7 because it just isn't that useful but for something like a
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:07.660]   tablet a real touch type of thing windows eight looks like it's gonna be
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.780]   pretty good I think in fact you you're not really doing you're not really doing
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.060]   it a fair job of looking at Windows 8 on a desktop unless you're using touch
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:20.860]   even on the desktop yeah I have a big fancy desktop it's certainly fast enough
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:26.460]   but does it have touch it has enough I do but it's not a touch and of course I
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:33.660]   want to reach up and yeah poke around on my screen when I'm typing it's not that
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:40.300]   way so I'm gonna convert that into a Windows 7 machine and make it one of the
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:46.580]   master machines here because it's a good machine but I don't need Windows 8 on
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:52.420]   it but I surface may turn out to be what I'm looking for look I don't know you
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:58.740]   guys act like you spend a lot of time in a room with a TV in it I don't is that
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:06.900]   cuz we're so stupid TV so forth I like to see movies although lately the movies
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:15.260]   I get tend to come from the from the SAG after a union and as review copies and
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:21.180]   you spend half your time being told the FBI is gonna get you look at the movie
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:27.860]   yeah but I don't spend a lot of time in in a room with a TV and it I still use
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:34.900]   computers I spend way too much time in a room with a TV on it yeah I don't think
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.740]   it's a mess office we're doing podcasts I don't see any time to look at what I'm
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.900]   not here I'm watching TV so Intel is not going to have and this is what I'm
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.260]   curious about to talk about the TV I still think this is the missing piece I
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.260]   mean this is the missing link and it's still been scattered shot you have
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.900]   different you have different companies making different content deals you have
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.060]   different apps different web apps last year we saw from Samsung that thing
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.900]   where you stand in front of it you wave your hand on yeah that went somewhere
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.340]   huh yeah I forgot about that and people were walking by it at the best buy in
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.060]   their trying to wave their hands or it's accidentally turned it on and off
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:11.260]   because you have you know morons turn on most frustrating thing I've ever done
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:15.700]   is try to use the connect to control an Xbox and you're standing here like this
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.300]   and it's just it's a pain in the ass and it's like just give me a mouse for
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.460]   crying out loud it looks like you're swatting it flies the whole time it's
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:31.580]   so horrible anyway yeah I agree with you we need a better set top box Intel I
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.060]   don't know why they did this they announced or they leaked that they were
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.860]   gonna have one and then they pulled back very fast and said but we won't do it
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:45.340]   at CES we won't do it till later this year like June the real problem for
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.140]   Intel is you can build it but if you don't get any content creators to support
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:55.060]   it you got nothing and apples having a hell of a time all Apple could do is rent
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.940]   and sell movies you know the whole idea is like well let's just with iTunes was
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.780]   successful so let's do something like that with video but video business has
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.980]   never been in the toilet like the music business so they're not desperate
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.900]   they're not desperate they don't care and besides yet you know I don't know I
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.780]   just think the whole thing is there they're in this tea jobs biography and I
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.700]   think this is accurate Isaacson said that the way Steve was able to get the
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.540]   record companies to go along with a carrot and stick approach saying first
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.740]   of all you're losing your shirt to piracy and that was true at the time
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.380]   remember and second we have a way of selling it and then the third key
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.580]   ingredient was we're just little Apple we're not gonna threaten you in any way
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:39.340]   well the music industry has learned that lesson as soon as iTunes became the
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.660]   number one seller of music it was all over and I think the TV and the motion
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.660]   picture industry you're right aren't aren't pressured by pirates in this as
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.780]   as much but more importantly have watched the experience the music industry
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.100]   hadn't said we're not gonna let Apple run this show at what point does it
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:01.060]   become a failure when you have these when you when you don't now have the
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:06.380]   ability to pick your shows the programs the channels all a cart right let's say
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.980]   you have the five or six stations that you end up watching I think there may be
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   three stations I end up watching on a regular basis that's the fear isn't it
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:19.940]   of right of all these companies is you won't buy if you just want to watch you
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:25.500]   know Game of Thrones right you're not gonna buy the big package we're not gonna
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.060]   make enough money I had a friend of mine who just signed up for showtime because
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:36.380]   he wanted to start watching Homeland right well that was a great show I'm
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.940]   never mind but just keep signing up for one service and it's because you know
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:45.060]   you have you have a showtime which is I guess maybe it's smart right you can't
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.740]   get Dexter Dexter season seven just wrapped up I don't have showtime right
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.580]   so I wait for it to come out on iTunes or on Netflix and I buy it when it's
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.020]   available but of course they want it you want to soak up as many DVD sales as
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:01.220]   they can so at what point what is the tipping point for for DVD sales you know
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.260]   you go into a Best Buy now they have like one rack of CDs left that's it
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.860]   remember they used to take up the whole right was enormous at a Best Buy now
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.740]   you walk in there it's one little rack I was in there just the other day DVDs of
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:20.340]   course are shrinking and now they have blue rays and a big discount bin right
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:26.700]   seven they're cheap oh that's a good deal they're cheap I couldn't believe it so
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.540]   you know it's a wonder how long until how long until Best Buy says you know
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.740]   what the real estate in our stores Walmart says the real estate in our stores
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.220]   we could have we could have better opportunities here I don't ever see
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.980]   anyone milling about in the DVD aisle why would you even go to a Best Buy the
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.660]   only reason you go to Best Buy is because they have refrigerators and you can
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.180]   take it home today you know that you can't spell Amazon I don't understand
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:52.140]   there's no reason to go to a brick and mortar store anymore right true I
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:57.700]   just want to go and experience television I mean yeah I bought my last TV you know
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.620]   how I bought my last TV I read all the reviews and I bought the best the one
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.020]   that everybody agreed was the best TV from Amazon I didn't look at that's
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.020]   except yours so what I did this was sad and I felt bad about it but I mean I'm
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.980]   not gonna apologize for $300 different so I was standing at a Best Buy my wife
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.860]   and I were there we wanted one for our living room that was gonna be big I
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.580]   talked her into a 55 and she wanted like I don't know 25 inches who knows and I
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:25.020]   wanted a big one we were there for like an hour and a half looking at I
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.260]   wanted 240 Hertz you know one of the whole things we're spending there talking
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.980]   with a guy at Best Buy for a long time who actually knew his stuff surprisingly
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.940]   and of course my wife knows her stuff in the CNET labs of course where they
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.300]   would test all these things in those dark rooms so we were there for quite a
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.340]   while and we thought okay this is the one we're gonna get and I just quickly
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.860]   I'm just gonna jump on Amazon here to see the difference it was a $300
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:50.180]   difference I mean I might have done some charity if it was like 50 bucks
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:54.500]   because the guy spends a lot of time with us but $300 it was absurd and then I
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.860]   didn't have to worry about lugging it out to my car right but how much did that
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:05.620]   guy make a day who who spent all that time with you well that's the point is
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.460]   that this is big this is not a viable business model best buy kit as a show
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.180]   room for Amazon that's not a viable business model yeah I think that's
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:19.260]   exactly correct and that's kind of what's what's happening to that did you
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.260]   know the same with the publishing industry which is my business everything's
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:31.260]   different now everything is changed so so I'm trying to imagine what the tipping
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.860]   point is going to be for content creators I mean really what you think kind of the
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.860]   ideal friction-free model would be content creators have what's the business for
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:46.260]   selling TVs as appliances well you got to buy a TV apparently you don't have to
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.940]   buy one more than every five or six years so that's kind of hurting the
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.500]   industry yeah that's why they're doing that's why one of the things you're gonna
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.940]   see what do you think you see more and more it's at CES is a desperate industry
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.940]   trying to convince people that there's a reason to buy a new TV and they tried
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:09.060]   3D three years ago that that tank and to make it better what with the financial
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.420]   cliff that we keep going over they they keep letting us go off hit the ground
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.460]   and then come back up and go over it again you're not gonna have a lot of
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:25.140]   people with a lot of discretionary change this year now you and I in the
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.460]   entertainment business we're gonna do all right Jerry Jerry maybe people don't
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:35.780]   know has it has a great show I think it's so you think you can dance sucka on on
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:41.460]   the Fox network are you in the entertainment business Jerry
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:47.260]   oh yeah you're right a writer is an entertainer not the song in dance business
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.060]   as I get no you're right that's the entertainment business yeah you're saying
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:55.860]   we're gonna do all right because in a depression people need to be elevated
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:00.020]   they need to be entertained yeah there's again than else to do basically the
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:05.300]   worst the economy the more of the better storytellers do and all we've been
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:10.220]   some build was successful during the depression when nothing else was right
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.460]   and the problem is right now during this past three years there's been some great
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.940]   frickin shows I mean there was a there was a dearth of shows for a while I
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.860]   didn't care about watching anything but now we've got such great content I
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.300]   run a cat almost all over the place you know almost all though on the pay
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:27.620]   channels like Showtime and HBO or am I all this good stuff 30 right I mean like
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:34.100]   effort like I love justified on on FX AMC warehouse 13 yeah yeah yeah
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:41.060]   on sci-fi channel yeah yeah seeing nothing yet look we when I we first got
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:48.900]   into this racket in order to become a record industry a recording artist you
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.860]   needed a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment now anybody can do
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.260]   that it's talent only you don't have to pay a producer to do anything for you
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:05.300]   right well we're getting there with movies my my friend the director tells me
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:11.100]   that for about fifteen thousand dollars in equipment you can now make production
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:18.180]   quality movies now you're gonna have a hell of a lot of talent coming up with
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:25.860]   different things you know a half like anybody did did good will hunting
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:31.940]   you're gonna have but now imagine that you could do that in your garage well
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.100]   that's exactly with new screens right but that's why I think that may be the
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.580]   tipping point because to get back to what I was saying is the key the
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.780]   friction-free solution is for content creators to sell directly to their
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:50.300]   audience so so you get a Ben Affleck selling directly to his audience you
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.260]   eliminate the movie company you eliminate the cable company you eliminate
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:58.580]   the cable channel all those guys are just a drag you are the perfect example of
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:03.700]   this exact model you are isn't this the future you in this studio well this
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.940]   studio is low over the top but I would say if you were green screening right now
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.820]   this would be the model of the future we're not trying to do it as cheaply as
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:18.220]   possible no no you remember John Stewart Bill O'Reilly thing that they did or
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:23.540]   Louis CK who instead of selling it through comedy channel the Comedy Central
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:27.700]   doesn't himself and makes a lot more money right so that's where you're gonna
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.140]   see the disintermediation and then maybe an Intel have a chance then maybe an
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.860]   Intel or an Apple can go directly and provide you know some sort of
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.500]   Roku Roku's already got this figure out yeah make but what you need is a
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.620]   marketplace right you need a way for me to go to Ben Affleck and say yes I'll
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:48.660]   buy your movie an Apple or an Intel could do that I mean Intel doesn't want
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.700]   to be in this business I don't know what it tells thinking I they want to sell
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:55.540]   chips it's a reference you know you have Netflix doing this and so arrested
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.820]   development when does the rest of development kick off very very soon right
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:04.740]   so you have them ponying up for a was a fourth season of a rest of development
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:10.060]   yeah they bought it not yeah and they also bought from Kevin Spacey's company
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.180]   Trigger Street they street they bought House of Cards which is a British show
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:19.340]   that they're gonna remake for Netflix I think this is the future and then if
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.700]   you're HBO you got to start to worry if you're Comcast you got to start to worry
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.740]   can something be gleaned from what Andrew Sullivan did this past week with his
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:31.500]   content with the way in which he's now putting out his content independent right
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.220]   what what yeah independent from the Daily Beast now he's going taking it back to
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:40.260]   Andrew Sullivan dot com and if you like him and you subscribe to to his his R if
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.300]   you want to want to read his content you can subscribe and pay I think it's 19
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:50.100]   or 20 dollars a year something like that yeah and then otherwise on the RSS
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:54.500]   feed it's still free content they're not he's not gonna put that behind a paywall
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.380]   similar to sort of what the New York Times does that if I share out an
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.420]   article to the New York Times you still have access to it for free but are we
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.740]   creating sort of these little niche communities now where we're loyal to
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.980]   just certain content and it's as you say disintermediate where it's all over
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.740]   the place and we we get our news from Andrew Sullivan and we pay a subscription
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:20.500]   to him I I subscribe to you know Marco Marcos the magazine same idea 99 cents
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.860]   a month right right I mean and it's all sort of scattered is not these big media
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.860]   houses putting out this stuff anymore fellas that's pretty rare one that's
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:35.740]   free years you have been haven't you sure he's been doing this forever is free
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:42.100]   you can pay if it's on the public radio model I won't keep it up if people don't
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:49.500]   pay but plenty of people do pay and as for my a good half of my income now comes
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:55.020]   from self published backlist books that's great my old books are making
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:01.260]   thousands a month just out there on there about it in Amazon mostly I store
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:07.340]   probably brings in 5% and maybe nook brings in 10% and the rest of it is is
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:12.300]   through Amazon and the nice thing about Amazon on paying for books that you
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:20.060]   publish yourself is they not only pay 70% royalty they pay it monthly two months
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:24.900]   in advance and they send to a check rather than with a traditional big line
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:30.340]   publishers who pay just on credible threat of lawsuit that's about right and
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.220]   don't forget to know agenda show dot com is somebody in the chatroom mentioned
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.780]   absolutely they are totally you're ad-free you're supported by the listeners and
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:42.780]   you make enough money to do the show another day in other words like Jerry
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.180]   you can't keep it up if people don't pay we will we won't keep it up let me
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:53.220]   point out that you you mentioned niches isn't that the future absolutely don't
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:45:01.180]   need 200 million readers yeah you do I'd like the idea I agree on I think
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:06.180]   that's what we're trying to do here is sir super serve a niche and I think if
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.980]   you deliver that niche now we're a little different because we're ad
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:13.140]   supported media so we're free media supported by ads I don't think it's so
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.580]   different in that you still have to have the best look at nothing's gonna get
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.820]   around the fact that if your content isn't great people aren't gonna pay
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.980]   for it and they're not gonna watch it right you have to have good content you
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:29.540]   love you have to at least have there were 14 million kendall sold last year I've
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:35.980]   seen newspapers telling me how awful it was because a reader you know electronic
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:41.260]   readers are going away because they sold fewer than they expected to well it
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:46.460]   seems to me that I don't need an enormous part of the 14 million in order to stay
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:52.820]   alive yeah I'll take 10% I'll take a million take a minute I'll take a half
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:46:00.220]   million and that at ten dollars and twenty dollars a year good happens it's
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:06.500]   the question is being able to find your niche and for your niche to find you I
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.220]   know there are a lot of people got walked over he said I've been here about
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.500]   this Apple TV I think I want to get one only 99 bucks I just what I overheard
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.780]   him say you know and my sister just got one for Christmas she doesn't know much
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:22.580]   about it she loves it now if you can open that up add adding more apps from
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.260]   other content providers without it being so locked down into the frustration
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:29.300]   though with companies like sling you know trying to get on the Apple TV and how
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:34.420]   difficult it is so I wish there were live on Apple TV I wish you know you know we
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.740]   know they can do it because Apple iTunes has live concerts every summer but they
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:43.380]   never open it up for live TV that's what that's the missing journal live isn't
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.860]   that the missing piece isn't that the missing piece though in court cutting
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:54.420]   so is Wall Street Journal live on iTunes on Apple TV yeah yeah in fact
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.540]   you click on it I was pulling up fooling around with it just the other day to
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.340]   see what stuff they had on there but it was a it was like a Sunday when they
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:04.820]   were off so there was no one at the Wall Street Journal on a Sunday and
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:08.260]   interesting through but during the during the week they have all that live
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.660]   content you know I'm and I'm I subscribed to you know they are the New York Times
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:15.300]   on my iPad so you'll see the embedded videos there and of course they do their
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.660]   live shows throughout the day on Wall Street Journal they were doing live on
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.780]   the Apple TV that's good apparently Al Jazeera is live on the Roku according
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:29.380]   to the chat room that I knew yeah now it's Al Gore's Al Jazeera of course
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.100]   work or Al Gore's zero we call it is yeah that's a good that's a good example
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:39.260]   though the the current TV situation is a great example of the no one watching
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:45.620]   problem you know and TV tell us about it well I mean I just I think it's one of
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:49.100]   those things where I'm confused by sort of like what Time Warner did right I
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.780]   mean Time Warner pulled off right it was sort of a Trojan horse thing saying well
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:56.180]   we're not gonna put Al Jazeera on these particular channels we're gonna keep an
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:00.940]   open mind and maybe we'll go back and do it later and yet in New York City Time
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:04.940]   Warner cable is is showing Al Jazeera but they're doing it because Al Jazeera
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:09.260]   are a pony on the backs of another cable company they sort of came in like a
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:13.220]   Trojan horse and gone on but you know what Time Warner and these other cable
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.940]   providers are saying is hey we've got you know 800 900 channels or whatever and
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:21.980]   these top tier channels way way up high if no one's watching your channel we're
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.580]   gonna bump you off now we're tired of fooling around right we're gonna bump
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:29.420]   you off and they're starting to rotate in new and different channels all the time
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.620]   to try to give other people an opportunity the problem I have with it though
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.220]   when you say that no one's watching current I bet more people watching current TV
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.700]   than we're watching some of the ridiculous there's like a random
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.780]   Filipino history channel or something way up in you know 900 just to fill
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.740]   people in that current was sold this week to it was Al Gore and others had
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.860]   started the channel some years ago they were on 60 million homes which is a
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.860]   large number of big percent of the available to 60 million homes yeah that
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:00.020]   doesn't mean they were on more their at-homes their average viewing was 45,000
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:05.260]   which is about tech TV's numbers we say was it was were they that low yeah wow
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:09.780]   that's very you were the number one guy in TV and you were hitting 45 I think
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.820]   the screensavers got up to 175,000 never heard that really yeah well we're
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.860]   doing a lot better either way we're doing a lot better yeah that's what we
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.340]   never did have any control over the other stuff they would make you not
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.700]   wear a Hawaiian shirt that's the thing that gold me the most I watch this you
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.900]   had a great show and then you were you know you were controlling and then all
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:30.820]   of a sudden some suit comes up and says hey take off the Hawaiian shirts Leo
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:34.340]   well because they couldn't make a living with 45,000 anymore the current can
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.900]   make a living with 45 kids the interesting thing is the you know Al Jazeera has
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.380]   never been able to get on US cable private probably because they're
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:45.500]   perceived as a terrorist news network which is not true years ago but actually
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.420]   not the coverage isn't bad no it's very good I think probably the real reason is
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:53.340]   international news and the cable companies probably rightly believe that
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.820]   Americans don't care about most Americans don't nevertheless I thought
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.340]   it was a little disappointing that Time Warner just cut you know said okay by
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.500]   the way this was in the deal this was in their contracts with current with I
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.580]   think all of the cable companies yeah I would change of ownership means we can
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.140]   reassess this right what their deal is just to put the we have to and they pull
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:15.580]   it off and they say okay you now just bribe us with some serious money and we'll
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:19.340]   put you back on this is a complete is that what happened Clayton is it what
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:23.460]   it's all it's all down to money because there's no if I mean if they're being
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:28.020]   hypocritical here you know I'm not sure I'm not sure if they're being hypocritical
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:32.020]   or not I mean it seems to me when you've got Chinese you've got Chinese state
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:37.220]   television oh did I just drop off no I'm really going but you're right we can
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.780]   still hear you you're just not moving oh that's all right I'd like to freeze
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:44.700]   every now and again yeah they have Chinese state television right I mean
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:49.220]   I see if you really want to talk about if you want to talk about you know I
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.900]   mean you know talk about what Chinese state television says Russia today for
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:57.220]   that matter yeah what propaganda they're putting out I mean you know if anything
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.140]   Al Jazeera has fought back against that stereotype from years ago and of course
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:04.580]   great you know they had some hosts that said some questionable things back in
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:08.460]   the day and they all they did you know did good coverage of the Arab Spring when
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:13.820]   really very few other channels I'll tell you I was watching Al Jazeera on the web
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.940]   not CNN not Fox not MSNBC it was Al Jazeera's coverage that I was watching
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.660]   and I had to watch it on the internet because it wasn't available on US television
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.380]   right yeah streaming live on the iPad is how we're able to see some of the stuff
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.700]   that was coming out of Tahrir Square I mean no one else you know if you're
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:34.060]   watching Twitter that's how anyone was able to see it absolutely yeah all right
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:39.820]   let's take a break we're talking with Clayton Morris of Fox and Friends the
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.220]   Al Jazeera of the right
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:49.780]   it's no I had I had to say that and it's not true half I don't even know what
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:53.420]   Clayton's politics are he's a fabulous fellow and that's all I care about
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:52:00.620]   he's a handsome man a good looking fellow too yeah and he just wishes he
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:09.260]   weren't here right now I call BS all around I call BS all around you have no
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.180]   agenda now Jerry Purnell is also here and I'm gonna ask him a little bit about
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:18.220]   NASA's plan to drag an asteroid into the moon's orbit because Jerry is into space
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:22.420]   I haven't heard this story I haven't either maybe Jerry knows all about it
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:28.340]   it's a straight off the web at new scientist calm NASA moles plan to drag
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:34.940]   asteroid into moon's orbit they want to build a robotic spacecraft to grab a
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.860]   small asteroid place it in high orbit it would cost about two point six
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:42.940]   billion dollars it's a little more than the curiosity could be completed by the
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:47.900]   2020s then you maybe you put somebody there it becomes a space station we'll
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:52.420]   be living on the moon any minute now yeah yeah sounds right right Jerry be
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:56.660]   easier to live on the moon than it would be to live on that asteroid but I wrote
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:01.500]   about all this in a step further out back in the 80s you know I know when we
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:07.580]   gonna have I want the elevator I know there's done take a while that one's
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:16.140]   harder to do that's no moon I like it talk 82 in the chair you win that's no moon
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:23.740]   a Seattle just scored oh no winning now a gun on RG3 you don't you aren't your
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:27.020]   west coast guy I'm a Niners fan but I have a feeling we'll be facing whoever
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:32.500]   wins this game you rather face after we beat I hate Seattle they're they're
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.260]   they're gonna have trouble against Aaron
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.380]   especially with this first we got to face Green Bay next that's what I'm saying
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:43.540]   that's that's Aaron Aaron yeah oh yeah the local boy the local boy he's good yeah
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:48.020]   I've noticed that guy can run yeah he can run he does have real football fan
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:55.940]   there and that's John C de Vorec no agenda fame
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:54:00.980]   Google no agenda Google no agenda that does that's I say to say they'm Google
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:04.980]   Twitter I'm the number one Twitter on the Internet we got six pages really
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:09.380]   before they go to something else yeah you picked wisely yeah I was weird yeah
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:17.300]   that's a good name what happens if you Bing no agenda Bing are sure they brought
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:22.300]   to you by Squarespace dot com you know that Squarespace this is I've heard of
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.900]   them are no agenda website is a Squarespace site it's yeah that's why I

[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:40.180]   - yeah I I'm in a photography and I said this year I'm gonna get better
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.100]   photography and I thought you know I'm gonna fail in public and I'm just gonna
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:47.860]   play around and blog about it so I want to I figured there probably a lot of
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.580]   other people that wanted to fail with me so I created a photo site in
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:54.460]   course Squarespace does a great job with so photography begins like Batman
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:59.460]   begins photography begins dot com and and it is great I mean the photo stuff
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:04.580]   that they are able to do resizing your images on the site is just gorgeous the
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:09.060]   upload you know being able to resize the responsive design on so many different
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:15.380]   great galleries it just really is nice look at these Clayton you're good thank
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.860]   you this is I didn't know you were a photographer yeah this year you know I
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.500]   shot my son's second birthday and I it was terrible I was so that's how I
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.660]   started it and I just said I was so embarrassed by the photos they were
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:30.380]   blurry it was terrible so I figured I'm gonna I'm gonna start really trying to
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:34.820]   learn this year and so these are beautiful shots so here's the deal try
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:39.140]   to bring a site down photography begins dot com or no agenda show dot com and
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:43.580]   you won't be able to if everybody watching this show right now goes to

[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:45.020]   them going to New Zealand in a in about a month or you got a look at the tray with
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:48.220]   our friend tray yeah so I'm gonna be there for like five days five six days
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:52.180]   shooting with the with trade will be a lot of fun I can't wait education yeah
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:59:00.900]   awesome all right moving along let's see Jerry did you know that NASA was gonna
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.300]   move an asteroid into orbit I don't I don't know exactly what the purpose of
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:13.020]   that is well the purpose it's not the same it to begin with the story says that
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:20.820]   some people are thinking about it okay I wrote about doing this in 1982 it's
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:26.020]   probably true that they're still thinking about it and eventually do it
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:31.780]   because 90% of the resources available to the human race are not on this earth
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:36.820]   and you're gonna have to have to have them at some point and my Arthur Clark
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:43.060]   said it pretty simply if the human race survives then for most of its history
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:48.580]   the word ship will mean spaceship right it otherwise we're just not gonna be
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:55.500]   here right but as to whether or not you could do it for two point six billion
[00:59:55.500 --> 01:00:00.780]   dollars I don't think NASA could do anything for two point six dollars NASA
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:05.860]   can't even pay its own salary for two point six dollars and billion dollars in a
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:10.100]   year that's been the big problem is they have this huge standing army of
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:15.380]   people who don't do anything but think if you want to have that done if the
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:23.060]   Congress were to say prize a four billion bucks for the first company that put a
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:29.980]   an asteroid in orbit outside the moons orbit around the earth you'd probably
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:34.340]   find somebody could do it for that price but NASA can't do it privatize
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:42.860]   space exploration no not exactly you can't privatize it thoroughly without some
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:49.780]   supervision because think about it for a minute and I'm sure I'd big enough to
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:01:00.500]   be useful moving at several thousand feet per second is is a city killer you can't
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:05.660]   let somebody just do that without some supervision because it's it won't have to
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:11.340]   make much of a mistake and got a disaster of proportion can't leave and we should
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:15.900]   have Rose blow fell let's just leave those asteroids in place okay no don't
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:22.460]   touch the asteroid didn't stay away from the asteroid it's worth doing because
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:27.660]   you need the resources I think the first big space resource and it looks like
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:33.180]   China and India may beat us to this is you use chemical rockets to put up a
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:38.100]   solar power satellite and now you've got an enormous amount of electrical power
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:45.420]   which you use to power laser rockets to put up more rockets and that starts
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.500]   getting cheap after a while you get a positive feedback loop out of it because
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.100]   you can always sell electric power to somebody how do you get back to earth
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:59.140]   what do you beam it back to earth oh yeah it it means nicely we tested this again
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:05.860]   we tested it 40 years ago yeah you have a satellite that that basically picks up
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:10.260]   solar power the trouble with ground based solar power is the Sun doesn't shine
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:16.420]   at night right and power storage is very expensive that same problem with wind
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:23.660]   melts wind doesn't blow enough so you have a you beam the power down and it's
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:29.740]   received on a grid that's maybe oh I don't know say 10 square kilometers would
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:36.820]   be a huge one and the grid is just a grid of wires about two me to meet four
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:43.420]   meters above ground and caps can graze on grid it's not dangerous under there
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:50.380]   because the power density is only a few milliwatts per square meter and when
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:54.180]   you're finished with it you can get an awful lot of power down that way and
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.340]   once you've done that with chief electric power you can do almost anything yeah
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:03.740]   we might need to do this this sounds good to me let's get going and then we can
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:08.380]   mine then we can go out to the mass asteroid mine it bring back the diamonds
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:14.260]   and will be rich that's what stab ros blowfeld said isn't that the plot of
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:22.700]   moon raker that's what he's saying been there done that so let me write my
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:30.900]   happen I mean this is you gotta remember I started in this racket is the science
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:36.580]   editor for galaxy science fiction magazine which is quite a while ago I love
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:43.380]   that wrote about this sort of thing all that time during the 60s and 70s of it's
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:51.540]   all feasible it's all possible but it isn't happening right now I can tell you
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.740]   how to make it happen you want a moon colony yeah
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:00.020]   states have determined that a lunar colony is in the best interest of the
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:05.460]   United States the first American owned company to police 31 Americans on the
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:10.680]   moon and keep them there alive and well for three years on a day it will be
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:16.060]   rewarded to some of ten billion dollars tax-free we could do that that's easy
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:22.300]   ban zoom bam a zinger it's the end of the legislation you don't need NASA to
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:26.940]   do it what you need is a market yeah and you could make a market you just write
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:33.780]   a check well for prices work yeah I had an English convinced of this but
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:37.980]   unfortunately the time he got to be speaker he had some other problems and
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:42.140]   we never got there yeah and made it might have made him sound a little nutty
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:47.540]   yeah he did talk it up at the base yeah when he was down there in Florida
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:52.020]   campaigning kind of comes off a little nutty yeah some how much does it cause
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:57.180]   to offer a prize which will not be paid unless somebody does it right easy and
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:01.740]   ten billion over ten years that's nothing I could do that I could do that
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:06.060]   I could do that I could do that let's get together you and take some of that no
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:11.740]   agenda money we'll do this let's do this thing I put a kid through college FTC
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:17.300]   says Google is not a monopoly you may resume business as usual Google gets a
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.780]   clean bill of health from the federal trade commission now they have to face
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:25.180]   the European Union in the EU says we're not going to pay attention to that but
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.540]   you know the big issue of course was the idea that Google search results
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:34.580]   favored yeah Google's own products FTC said no I think that this changed I
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:39.220]   remember when I first like maybe five or six years ago started using AdSense yeah
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.660]   I would notice that if that websites that used AdSense would get higher
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:49.020]   rankings in their search results than those who did not use AdSense and I
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:53.020]   noticed this consistently for a couple of number of years and then one day it
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.420]   changed and I think there with the investigation was looking at was what's
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.620]   happening today and I think Google got a clue and pulled a plug on this trick
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:05.260]   whatever it was I haven't seen it at all lately that no smoking gun the other
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:08.820]   issue of course is does YouTube do YouTube results show up higher in video
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:14.380]   I haven't do Google plus results what other video is there well you know what
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.940]   that's probably one of the things they said is well who you gonna put Vimeo yeah
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:21.860]   right I mean I just even if you just pop up on Google News or you put whatever
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:24.580]   you know you just you just jump in there's always gonna be YouTube videos
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.660]   that are gonna pop up right at the top right seems like every time I do any
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.260]   sort of a search those you know anytime I do a search for Kim Kardashian those
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:35.940]   videos come right up me too me too which is what I'm looking for yeah thank you
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:40.500]   thank you thank you Google God I don't know what I do without Google let me
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.980]   please that devil's advocate on this though I mean who cares it wouldn't the
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:48.820]   free market and enable us to find a better search engine if this were you
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:54.700]   know we see what the we see this perhaps with app.net I think if you look if you
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:58.860]   look at the decision in a more nuanced way that's kind of what the FTC is saying
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:04.140]   is since Google does not have a monopoly they said it's not a violation of anti
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.020]   trust so they didn't say they're not doing it I think they're actually saying
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:11.740]   what you're saying Clayton is it's since it's not a monopoly it's not an issue
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:17.180]   right let me ask you something do you think that it's illegal for people to
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:22.660]   advertise in the yellow pages. Oh of course not well isn't that basically what
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:27.420]   it is when you advertise on Google well I guess the question is is it an
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:32.780]   advertisement or is it search results for Google products being ranked more
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:37.740]   highly than they would be otherwise and isn't it a cut isn't it a public
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:42.620]   company I mean it's it's a company after all right so if you don't like if you
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:46.460]   don't like that every time you go to go daddy you know you get inundated with
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:53.700]   chicks taking their tops off then you go over us again now now the of course the
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.820]   competitors are Bing and Yelp doesn't like this because Yelp saying you know
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:02.100]   you Google results show too much zagat and Google places and too little of us
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.500]   there's a lot of Yelp in the results I think it's pretty hard for them to
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.700]   prove that yeah but I've seen more Yelp results than zag it results yeah I'm
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:18.060]   it but do you know who use Yelp who uses Yelp is there anybody here I do I
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:22.180]   use Yelp you know it is an iPhone you're using Yelp yeah use it all the time on
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:27.260]   my iPhone yeah because it's kind of nice just to get a little sense of what I'm
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.660]   getting into when I go to a restaurant for example hey the truth the truth is I
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:36.220]   think most of us don't have an allegiance to any one system but look at reviews
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:41.860]   from whatever shows up zagat Google places Yelp yeah right yeah yeah I did
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:45.420]   like you know when I got some hands-on time or before before Bing came out
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:51.020]   with their new you know revised setup that was at four five six months ago now
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.540]   you know about two months beforehand I got to play with it for quite a while and
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:59.140]   while it was still in beta and I have to say I really I really liked it but I
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.220]   just don't it's maybe it's just the convenience I've got the Google universe
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:07.100]   sort of tied together with everything you know am I gonna jump over there all
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.820]   right but now now having said that Google does something that is obviously
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:20.420]   anti-competitive they block maps on Windows phones I mean that is so now
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:25.820]   they said well we did it because we test browsers and on the old Windows
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:30.580]   phones the browser experience wasn't good enough yes old Microsoft tactic by the
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.860]   way so we've decided to block it now and then of course as soon as the articles
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:38.580]   came out you know people using Windows Phone 8 said what the hell like not
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.940]   only is there no Google Maps app but I can't do it on the browser Google said
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:47.500]   oh now they're saying it was a product decision but we've reassessed the
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.940]   the browser speed on Windows Phone 8 it's fine we're to turn it back on
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:58.140]   ah sweet do you buy that Google's been acting a little bit anti Microsoft remember
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:03.420]   they turned off exchange active sync which means that you can't use Google
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:10.300]   calendar and Google contacts with the Windows Phone Microsoft they had a
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:13.740]   licensee as from Microsoft and so it's not an unreasonable thing for them say
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.420]   we're not gonna pay for this right why should we pay for this use iMap use
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.100]   cal dev use card dev these are open standards we support those why are we
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:25.380]   paying you a license fee I think it's a feud going on between these two companies
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:30.180]   obviously there's clearly a few a feud yeah I don't know what's gonna come
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:35.100]   about I'm curious what what is this hilarious yeah there there's no real
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:40.340]   explanation as to what version of of Windows Phone or Internet Explorer on
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.380]   Windows Phone wasn't it wasn't compatible with because their argument was
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.380]   it wasn't WebKit based and therefore it wasn't compatible Google says this is
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:53.860]   gonna change but right I think was it Windows Phone 8 it was a 7.5 8 because
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.540]   because that goes back to sort of what Danny Sullivan was talking about as
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:01.980]   part of Google's weird statement on this is that maps compatibility with mobile
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:05.340]   browsers to make sure that they deliver the best experience for their users and
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:12.660]   the IE mobile test on mobile browsers the IE mobile test wasn't at great maps
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:16.860]   experience according to Google but that's not really true and they're not really
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.900]   talking about exactly what version it was some part of the experience
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:26.700]   apparently was was was faulty they supported Windows mobile that's what's
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:33.580]   interesting which is really a crappy browser yeah Google hasn't said I mean
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.140]   they haven't said was it you know a 9 for mobile and why all of a sudden now
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:42.900]   Mary Jo Foley who hosts our Windows weekly show said she asked Google and the
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.220]   Google representative said the redirection for Windows Phone users has
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:51.820]   always been in place but she and others said wait a minute no I've been using
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:12:05.060]   it for at least the past year plus so what is going on so Danny wrote and
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:13.700]   posted the article at midnight that day and he has actually a post script on it
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:21.460]   and he says if you if you if you go to maps.google.com on a HTC 8X or a
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:28.220]   Lumia 900 you go you don't get maps you get routed to Google however if you go
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:34.180]   to maps.google.co.uk you get maps huh you go to the British version
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:39.660]   and as Mary Jo Foley said he said yeah I was pretty sure I'd been to Google
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:48.780]   maps on these phones as well but the problem is nobody took a screenshot I
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:53.100]   don't you know it's a puzzlement in the in summary Danny says I don't think
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:57.500]   Google changed anything I just think a few realized it was this way before
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:02.020]   including myself hello hey Jerry still no luck with Jerry so this would be a
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.500]   good time to take a break what do you say we're going to talk about land trucks
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:09.820]   we do not have believe it or not we do not have a Tom Merritt the week ahead oh
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:17.140]   no Tom has moved to LA he has and left us what about Eileen where she moved
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:20.340]   with him she got a job it that's why he moved she got a job at YouTube down
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:23.740]   there at the new that's what happened to you creator space yeah you know that
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:28.380]   beautifully built a beautiful studio for youtubers to you tubers you tubers
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:35.740]   yeah I got a couple youtubers drone in the backyard what do you call a guy a
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:39.940]   person who posts regularly on YouTube not a youtuber I would call him that
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:43.540]   youtuber their couch like it's a new kind of couch but yeah so you so they
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:48.140]   moved to LA so she's working for YouTube making big money yep Tom has a new
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:53.740]   house with Fios an incredible fire oh that's where he got the files he didn't
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:14:01.420]   get in LA and so he's gonna be skyping into TNT but I guess because of the
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:07.980]   move he he hasn't yet set that up but at some point I hope if Tom is well
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:11.380]   Jason how's by the way running the board today because Chad is already in Vegas
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:15.060]   yeah Jason hell who is a part of TNT and of course produces a show what's the
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.260]   plan Jason do you know is he gonna do the week ahead as far as I know the week
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:23.700]   ahead yeah because we're still going to do TNT five days a week and
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.540]   right now when we're done with that on Fridays he'll just do that okay he just
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:30.900]   wasn't on this Friday this Thursday or Friday so that's why because of the move
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.260]   and there's no best of twit this week no one of those house ads that you
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:40.020]   talk know how sad no house I became a kind of enamored with these house ads
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:45.180]   there was nothing good this week we decided you can't do a best of no no so
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:48.340]   next week we hope they'll be something to now to cheer I think that joke maybe
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:54.460]   you can use that let's use that for the best of to it it's timing I showed
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.500]   they brought to you by Landtrox if you ever done this if you ever tried to get
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:02.300]   your USB printer working with your network or maybe tried to print from an
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:08.140]   iPad or an iPhone to your printer it is not easy as it is is complicated
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.100]   sometimes you have to get special software I've got a way to do it that is
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:17.060]   so great it's so easy it's the Landtronics X print server and I know I've
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:21.420]   spoken to a lot of people now who have because of us talking about it on the
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:27.060]   air tried it we we had an administrator of a school network who said it'd been a
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.780]   nightmare she has all these network printers all these USB printers bam
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:35.300]   everything worked is kind of out of the box there's no configuration it just
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:39.020]   recognizes all the printers it just works now there's two versions of the
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:45.740]   X print server there's the home edition for 99.95 and that will handle up to eight
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:50.780]   USB and two network printers and then you've got the slightly more powerful
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:55.260]   office edition for 199.95 and that's eight USB printers and
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:59.300]   unlimited network printers so in a home you don't really probably need the
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:04.740]   $200 version the 99.95 version is just fine and I'll tell you you don't need any
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.340]   special software on your iPad or your iPhone it just prints easily it converts
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.980]   any USB printer into a network printer which is fantastic so you don't need to

[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:08.900]   ask this is a little while we're working on Jerry by the way that's all this is
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:13.620]   what it's a little Roarjock test yeah this is us called a Spooner mug because
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.460]   it's got a little spoon spoon and it's a hand you know it stores with the spoon
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.660]   so you and that's a smaller that's for the ladies and this is a little bit
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:27.300]   like this oh my exactly what I thought yeah why would you want because in my
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.420]   opinion a mug is a perfect spoon holder what do you need a what do you know
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:35.980]   all in the handle for it what it's just made out of porcelain this thing no I
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:40.500]   think it's not a bad idea you know you like that idea yeah because you know
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.300]   then you you don't want to lay the spoon let's say you're at one of those
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.700]   like diners you sit near at the bar having you don't want to put it on the
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:49.260]   bar you don't want to rest it on the bar and then you don't want the spoon in
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.740]   your mug because then it's shoving in your eye the whole okay okay a little

[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:57.140]   look great and I think I think we had a network congestion error here oh my
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:01.500]   god with all the pipes you got running into this place it's shocking what do
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.540]   you do in Clayton not to get sick at sea yes this year I'm a little worried
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:11.220]   because the flu is is is back D3 what yeah I took a vitamin D 3 D you had a
[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:14.580]   flu shot yeah I mean because of the kids you know we have a seven month old
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:18.260]   and so I we went to look at the flu shot and this year after that Wall Street
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.140]   Journal article came out of about a month and a half ago saying that it's
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:25.820]   worst it's gonna be really really bad it's earlier than ever this year and they
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:29.780]   always say it's 90% effective this year last year's dosage of the flu shot was
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:35.700]   like 35 or 40% effective this is like the 90% strain of it so I've been fine so
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:39.580]   far I didn't get shot and I'm going to Vegas I'm gonna be with a hundred thousand
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:45.140]   get some folks friends get some relands a packet in your suitcase if you can't
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:50.020]   how we may know just don't shake hands no but don't shake hands put one of those
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:54.300]   face masks on can wear a rubber glove when you put it actually when somebody
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:58.460]   wants to shake your hand put the rubber glove on just before shaking it and then
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:03.660]   then they stop Roblofow they pleased to meet you yes like you're about to make
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:16.380]   a love I am mad I'm crazy I don't want to go just just hug I'm gonna get sick you
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:19.860]   with that attitude you will get sick no he's that superstitious it doesn't
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.900]   have anything to do with what I think is gonna happen it's called germs John we
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:30.180]   figured it out now what what the little feels that micro microbes they've
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:34.340]   figured that out it's not it's not the air I wouldn't go to this show if I had
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:39.700]   your your attitude to Apple apparently did offer to buy ways it went back and
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:44.700]   forth all week the battle of the tech crunch bloggers take okay so I took a
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:48.900]   forward up to Washington and back yeah as part of reviewing good viewing
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:53.940]   for which one the C max oh that's ice the hybrid yeah it's actually peppy yeah
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:57.540]   of course anyway they have lots of torque yeah but you know that's a new engine
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:01.540]   instead just a eco boost well no no there's a there's a Lewis that's a Lewis
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:04.180]   then I can't remember the name of it but it's an old engine from the 1890s that
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.260]   all the hybrids use because it's very compatible electric motors yeah it's
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.140]   very interesting but anyway so what was I gonna talk about it forgot you were
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.740]   gonna talk about ways because you used ways so here I go with using Google Maps
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:19.020]   I'm using the thing is in the car I'm trying it I cannot use ways why not because
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:22.340]   this guy is always want you to do stuff and is you trying to drive and I want
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:25.940]   you to do this and once you do that oh send us a note about the cop that's
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:30.860]   down in there I mean it's not too much work this is a lot of work I gave up on
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:34.140]   I think it sucks it's a crowd sourced map app and it's what it's what's nice
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.620]   about it you can ignore what it's asking you to do what's nice it'll say
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:40.220]   there's a police officer ahead they'll say there's debris in the road I don't
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.780]   like it there's a car by the center inconvenient I don't like the way I just
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:47.700]   don't like it at all and it's fantastic we drive up from the the
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:51.540]   Poconos down we were tested out ways and boy it knew that there was gonna be
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:55.500]   this traffic jam up there that there's a there was a little pocket of the
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:00.380]   destruction in a really rural area though like in this really backwoods area
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:05.340]   if you got somebody in the car with you using it yeah it's fantastic but if you
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:09.860]   have to use it yourself yeah it's dangerous I agree with you it's a little
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.700]   dangerous it's a little too fun you see yeah you start getting there you start
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:16.220]   I'm gonna add a little construction hat to the guy and I'm gonna let people know
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:19.180]   that there's a cop over there and then before you know it you're a part of the
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:24.260]   accident and you get points for that or the game of fight it so you get points
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:29.020]   or do you get a bad you know you do you get a custom you can tell somebody's
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:34.380]   been always a long time because they have custom icons oh isn't that something
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:40.100]   it sucks me in yeah I hate gamification oh it's all about the data I mean and
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.260]   this is something that apples maps are terribly lacking and of course and so as
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.660]   they try to iterate it but you know at the beginning I mean they had been
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:48.780]   partnering with ways in the beginning and a couple of the companies of course
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:52.860]   they were partnering with Tom Tom ways and who else there's somebody else that
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:57.580]   they were they had in the mix I think Yelp is in there for POI right think so
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:01.540]   I don't know about the traffic I'll try the help again be with traffic but so
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:04.580]   they had a partnership with them so they're pulling some of ways you know
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.700]   they're pulling some of ways data something and they still are
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:11.140]   presumably I guess maybe they need more of it or they just needed to own them
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:14.860]   but I guess their offer wasn't high enough apparently they offered half a
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:20.460]   billion dollars ways said were worth 750 million at least that's what people are
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:24.660]   reporting we don't know what really happened I hope that I would I think it
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:28.420]   would be a mistake for any amount of money to go to Apple because I think that
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:32.820]   they would be subsumed and oh yeah and ruined ruined just as La La and Siri
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:36.860]   have been I think ways is doing great now by the way you know that you can
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:41.380]   just wave your hand and then talk to it you don't have to touch it in any way
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.060]   I read that on the chatroom too well I use ways that's how I do it you wave
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:50.260]   your hand at what at the phone I have my phone on my dashboard I'm using an
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:55.900]   Android same thing you wave your hand at the phone and then it says what and you
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.740]   go report an accident and you can interact with it you don't have to touch
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:03.980]   it yeah but it's so fun to touch well that's the problem it is a little I
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:07.580]   admit it's distracting because it's cool they've done a great job with it I think
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:11.420]   it's also Mickey Mouse it's got these little pity icons it's too pretty I mean
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:14.540]   it's got all these little things in the chatroom said during the holidays they
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:18.100]   had dancing candy canes yeah that's not talking about that isn't that's kind of
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:23.020]   thing yeah that's not kind of kind of and that is supposed to be legal in
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:27.740]   California yeah you get but you just can't touch your phone yeah but you can
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:33.900]   have dancing candy canes on the dashboard thank you RGC I think somebody's
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:41.580]   lost their mind 20 million users close to 30 million one of the issues is that
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:46.020]   monetization is weak they do they will let they I think there I think there are
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:50.260]   some ads that pop up from time to time that's another bad idea yeah but I've
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.780]   done it yeah it's not supposed to pop I think up unless you're stopped well
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.340]   that's still your stop you say wait a minute which way am I supposed to go
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:02.900]   left or right yeah there's a lot of things like a traffic jam on
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:07.580]   I think Apple has a trouble though admitting that they don't have the data
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:13.340]   well they better because they don't they don't and they'd like to say that
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:17.060]   look we've got millions of iPhones out on the roadways and soon enough we'll
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:20.380]   have the same sorts of data that we're being able to pull from these other
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:24.980]   companies but you wonder if it ends up being sort of like it's almost like a
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:32.060]   Dropbox scenario right right you know they make the offer your your a service
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:37.940]   rather than a then a platform and you're just a failure a feature is one of
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:42.860]   Steve Jobs said to Dropbox you're a feature yeah yeah he was wrong I think
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.700]   yeah it's become a lot more than a feature in a lot of people's minds it's
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:52.660]   amazing yeah but it's enough for them to provide data I don't know I can I don't
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.020]   know yeah and then I think with privacy concerns there's a lot of legitimate
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:03.100]   concerns about using services like that because they can look at your stuff
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:09.940]   they could yeah but careful what you post so did you like this that starting
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:15.220]   January 1st do not disturb did not work on the iPhone until January 6th yeah
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:20.740]   huh it's still on it should have it should have fixed itself by now no
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:24.300]   but flipping on and off let me see if I flipped it off of my iPhone and I really
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.620]   use it I mean as you know what I do morning show and stuff getting up really
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:34.420]   early yeah random game center things coming in to you know to play play
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:38.860]   letterpress in the middle of the night and when I flipped it on no it's still not
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.100]   still giving me issues well it's the seventh no it's supposed to be tomorrow
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:48.580]   right oh it's not today tomorrow oh I got to be right tomorrow yeah so ours
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:52.980]   Technica X you know I thought this is a good this is a good problem for for
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:58.020]   programmers a challenge what programming flaw is there that would cause this
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.820]   thing to fail January 1st through 7 that is a good challenge you know what could
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:07.780]   that be and it turns out there was a really interesting article ask ours Jackie
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:14.660]   Chang figured it out I think it has to do with the ISO weak numbering system
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:19.820]   which is a standard system for numbering the weak and apparently it's not an
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:23.620]   unusual bug the reason most phones don't suffer from this is people program
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:27.940]   around it it's a known flaw and apparently apples programmers just didn't
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:35.700]   know that or didn't fix it that's not good yeah well surely they must have known
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:43.460]   it last year no because this is a new feature that came out in iOS 6 as of as
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:48.500]   of this year in fact here's here's on github here's some sample code that does
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:55.220]   it so they used apparently they used lowercase yyyyyy you know I've been
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:31:01.700]   telling that for years why are you in the lowercase yyyyy what a blunder in most
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:11.460]   cases yyyyyy is the same as yyyyyy except you know in some cases apparently
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:17.460]   this one this case is one of the early yyyyyy is the Gregorian calendar oh geez I
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:22.540]   mean that is yeah I thought everybody knew that come on I thought and I thought
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:26.940]   the Mayans had something to do oh my god it's a strangest thing I'm sure it
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:31.060]   will be fixed for it before next year but well did they have two years in a row
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:34.860]   Apple had problems with the alarm not working after new years that's right
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:41.100]   maybe I mean I always get stuck you know I'm always working the holidays so you
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:44.220]   know on my birthday I'm drinking on New Year's Eve and then you know what
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:47.740]   wake up to try to go to work on the first of the year and I know half the
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:51.940]   half the staff uses their iPhones to wake up excuse I can't understand I'm
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:57.300]   late my iPhone broke I always find it weird that people use their I've my
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:00.300]   son does this use the alarm yeah everybody does this what do you mean
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:10.860]   you want to use my dang telephone what do you want to use a Sony
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:14.860]   dream machine what are you talking about
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:21.260]   folding alarm clock I take with me on trips forgot so you got a phone do you
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:25.780]   also wear a wrist watch see there's a real alarm thing there I mean I want
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:30.740]   some their wrist that alarm clock first of all that's set to some time three
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:34.860]   years ago you know it's like it's gonna it's for it there never the hotel clocks
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:38.900]   are never set right and then there are some awful station so you've got you
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:46.140]   know that gets you up iron man wakes you up in the morning morning zoom you know
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:51.540]   there is this wake up call service I don't want to talk to somebody at four
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:54.820]   in the morning I always get I always set the alarm and I got to make up to
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.020]   sometimes they forget to call your wake up call I like when I said would you
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:06.100]   like a second call I always take it yeah those are the good hotels I think
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:10.820]   you guys are just old farts everybody today uses their phone as a watch and
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:15.340]   it's a watch yeah I use I my backup alarm now is not another it's it's my
[01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:19.820]   iPad so now that they added the alarm me on the on the I use it that's my second
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:24.860]   alarm exactly iPad and I asked Siri I just you know Siri wake me up yeah yeah
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:32.660]   exactly what you say yeah set alarm for 445 you know and I'm done good luck
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:40.340]   series okay I said an alarm for 445 am that's awesome see it that's well
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:47.660]   about twenty one of that thing cost again for other things to that's the most
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:53.980]   expense of alarm clock you use it for only use it for that for a lot okay was
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:58.420]   that a mini or a max that was a mini that's the mini you like the mini I I
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.300]   yeah I use this on the set all the time now I pretty much don't even use the
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:05.180]   large one I have the large one at home like on my desk yeah it's too big is
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:11.700]   anything like the next seven yes just like the next it's for three but deep
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:15.620]   but I think you know this is funny because this is feels heavy the old iPad
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:21.100]   feels heavy and big now you're using the mini for a while I like the mini it's
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:25.180]   not read the only negative I wish they'd made it a red it is funny when you pick
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:29.300]   up the big one again you realize the difference in screen resolution yeah
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:33.980]   don't so the trick is throw out your iPad 3 and 4 all right because then it's
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:37.140]   just making you want something you can't have it's become like a media device for
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:40.660]   me now it just sits on my desk at home and I you know I all stream like using
[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:43.980]   the Verizon FiOS app if I want to you know watch some television while I'm
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:47.980]   doing some work I'll stream it up there in my office or put on sling box or
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:50.620]   something like that and stream it I really don't pick it up for anything
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:55.780]   other than that anymore the thing is huge number four seven says the iPhone 5
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:02.220]   is the worst of the best smartphones the worst of the best it is that's the
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:07.420]   prettiest they're their favorite phone is the LG Optimus G which is the same as
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:12.500]   the Nexus 4 right let's do one I in the galaxy S3 actually I like my note to
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:16.660]   that's the one I use you have an excess for right or no the old Nexus I have
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:23.500]   the Nexus Nexus Nexus Nexus yeah the iPhone is lower than the droid razor max
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.340]   I wouldn't say that that droid razor max is not a very good phone the droid
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:33.340]   razor HD and the galaxy S3 all beat the iPhone on Verizon on what was this survey
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:38.780]   who did this assume reports what are the criterion for best well they didn't
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:42.460]   really say actually it's interesting they didn't they gave them numerical
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:48.220]   reasons but ratings but they didn't really say you know kind of overall what
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:52.260]   were the issues I don't know this is a problem with consumer reports I like
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:56.220]   consumer reports but that is a that is a that is a failure yes I'd say I have
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:36:00.140]   different columns of moving numbers like that and none of them when you when
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:04.020]   you'd fail then to look at it as a whole I mean it's a huge that's a huge
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:07.740]   failure right I think that's what wire I think that's what wire cutter is doing
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:12.380]   really great I like wire cut is Brian Lamb yeah yeah because he's given you know
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:15.820]   it's not he's not trying to do it with these columns and these random numbers
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.380]   and trying to give you an overall and then not looking at a whole he just says
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:25.380]   what's best yeah I don't always agree with him but most the time I do actually
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:32.140]   so he's that's that's kind of that's very simple and then if you want more I
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:39.700]   think what Ryan Block is doing at GDGT.com is great because they take all the
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:45.340]   reviews and they synthesize them into a number right I mean that's how I do it
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:47.820]   go see a movie right it's like rotten tomatoes like rotten tomatoes
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:53.580]   a great site although they gave that bond movie some ridiculously high
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:57.980]   terrible movie was a terrible movie you and I the only people in the world no
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:02.140]   Skyfall was terrible my son up in Washington who's a great movie critic
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:07.020]   thinks it sucked it had the plot holes it was corny it didn't have any any
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:11.620]   dies at the end and then they don't explain it now he's back but it's James
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:15.820]   bond no but at least in the other James Bond when he dies they explain oh you
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:19.900]   know he wasn't really in the casket or that was a trick in this one they
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:23.620]   shoot him he falls off a train 800 feet to his death and then the next scene
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:28.300]   he's back yeah there's no explanation no explanation you know the next scene
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:31.100]   he's then he's been drinking for three months well that's the other thing I
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:36.220]   don't like to see a James Bond that isn't James Bond he's like old and tired yeah
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:40.220]   he can't pass the test he can't shoot straight yeah and then Miss Benny Penny
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:44.340]   appears it's like no he's he's old now money penny's been there since the
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:48.460]   beginning why she suddenly the whole thing is terrible it's one of the worst
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:52.020]   movies I'm into totally agreement with you on this on this horrible movie and
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:56.340]   made is 95 but if they were right about Django and change that's a great
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:02.700]   movie that's a new power source it's called you you harness that energy from
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:06.300]   me and Fleming spinning around in his grave
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:11.780]   definitely perpetual motion Fleming yeah so anyway gadget to get back to tech
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:15.380]   gadget does the kind of the same thing they take reviewers and real people it
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.500]   is just like rotten tomatoes actually well that's a good thing tomatoes is
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:23.580]   pretty much accurate I agree except for this one instance well I don't think
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.700]   it's never no it's true there never disagree with their their reviews yeah
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:32.460]   we saw Looper the other night great movie great movie is you going to see
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:36.420]   your sense I'm watching a lot of TV and then I'm going to the movies when I'm
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:41.060]   not watching TV I've I'm so sad and lonely that I just hear it like you all
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:46.220]   the time I buy myself I buy a big bag of popcorn you could find me for
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:49.900]   fourth road pretty much any movie I got and now and now with kids I mean there's
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:53.740]   no way so I have to be more discerning about the movies you know I don't go
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:57.620]   see if there's a movie that has under a 70% on rotten tomatoes is that your
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:05.420]   limit mine 62 62 yeah yeah I find if a movie is 62 or higher I generally like it
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:09.460]   if it's 62 or lower I generally don't like it huh yeah I have to pay more to I
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:13.660]   don't see enough my sample right now I used to go like every week to a movie
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:16.980]   I feel terror I haven't seen I'm gonna see them all that often I'm gonna get a
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:20.740]   big screen in Saran sound it's just as good I just do it at home this is good
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:24.780]   I got the 3D glasses now I can get a headache at home it's great you're using
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:28.460]   the real three real deal you've got the Phillips you've got the Phillips hue
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:32.540]   light bulbs you can set the mood I do a mantic comedy I do and if I could just
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:35.540]   get everything to work together and have the curtains open automatically the
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:42.100]   lights go down you got crap how big is your screen it's not that big I want to
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:46.660]   get that Westinghouse 110 I want a 4k TV you get when I'm surprised you bought
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:51.940]   didn't buy a 4k there's a stunned by the fun by the Sony which is the only one
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:57.140]   on the market right now it's only $25,000 I think a good deal oh yeah steal and it
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:02.060]   comes with a media server because there's no 4k content so it comes with a hard
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:05.900]   drive a media server stuff on it something to watch yeah great because
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:13.500]   there's otherwise there's nothing you got too much money that's the problem I
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:19.860]   mean it's nice that you're making a lot of no joking is not joking but for God
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:25.700]   thanks but that's a strange way to spend no I'm teasing I don't believe
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:30.020]   25,000 is ridiculous I wouldn't buy a TV you just wait a year be 12 5 and you'll
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:33.220]   buy it no what was that that the movie set up that you could get in your house
[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:36.500]   that was announced like a week ago two weeks ago where you could get first run
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:40.580]   movies when they're released in the theater at your house for what it 225,000
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:46.580]   that's what you need yeah I remember that but it was like so you don't it's
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:49.900]   you know it's for it's for people who are so famous like George Clooney they can't
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:54.140]   go to a movie theater right but they can afford a quarter of a million dollars to
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.660]   basically watch first run movies at home and he uses like biometrics or some
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:00.860]   ridiculous thing to make sure that you're the one that paid for it so you can't
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:03.820]   then screen it for other people can't you bring a bunch of your friends over
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:08.660]   sure you can sure sure I'm on over theater in this house actually it's not
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:16.340]   that expensive it's twenty thousand dollars a movie yeah it's a steal you
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:21.380]   can't go wrong wait wait no no I'm sorry I got it wrong so it's twenty
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:25.260]   thousand dollars for the digital delivery system one-time fee five hundred
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:29.380]   dollars a movie and it's by the way it's best buying general electric that's
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:33.100]   doing this universal pictures people wonder why best buy is going out of
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:36.460]   business it's the pre minute you just saw a picture of it if you're watching the
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:40.860]   video it looks beautiful the pre minute they say they expect here's the 250,000
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:45.140]   number Clayton they expect to be in a quarter million homes within five years
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:52.180]   oh please it's a niche market says Adam Fogelson chairman of universal pictures
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:56.900]   and precisely actually probably talks like this precisely because it is a niche
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:00.820]   market that upside should come without harming any of our existing partners
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:06.860]   or revenue streams well so niche very
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:13.900]   very luxury theater private clubs that really I mean you talk about niches
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:23.940]   I really niven brother took me to took us to the Avengers in a private movie
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:30.220]   studio in a club studio in Pasadena and they serve drinks and they serve you
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:36.420]   basically a dinner if you want it and you have luxury seats and that would
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:45.300]   seem to me to make more sense than owning your own studio yeah I just
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:52.340]   don't spend that much time in rooms with television sets now but it's nice to go
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:57.620]   to a luxury movie theater once in a while I'll often pay for the for art
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:02.940]   lights simply because it is comfortable yeah we're getting in San Francisco is
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:08.180]   getting a alamo draft or tap house whatever it's called the one in Austin
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:11.700]   where you can go and you have tacos and drink beer and then watch all we we
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:16.100]   know now we want to see Lincoln there's a place out by us in Jersey it's
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:22.580]   fantastic and you love overcliners yeah I love bringing meals wine
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:31.620]   almost draft and it's world and there is a market for for luxury as well as for
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:39.300]   I mean the thing the Internet has done is to connect niche suppliers with the
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:45.460]   niche that it's applying exactly what's happened with with books it's an
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:52.020]   artisanal world we live in this is decadence at its worst well no I mean
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:57.700]   the tournament movie someone was my feet but from my point of view my my back
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:02.500]   was Natalie is now reaching people who didn't know that it was available and
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:06.780]   it's a fairly good steady source of income from my from me isn't this what
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:10.460]   happens though when the economy goes in the dumper there are still there's
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:15.380]   still a thin veneer as people do not want to mix with the whole a ploy so those
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:21.380]   those decadent services for that highest end client yeah you those do well
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:28.900]   always you understand that when they talk about tax increases they never talk
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:34.460]   about a tax increase on wealth it's always a tax increase on income it's
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:38.500]   basically preventing people from becoming wealthy that's the goal of all
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:42.580]   of this crazy system now I agree we should have already got money you're not
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:49.140]   gonna have any problems with it Warren Buffett is still paying lower taxes than
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:53.700]   his secretary that's why we need a wealth tax ladies and gentlemen a wealth tax
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:59.660]   of 1.5% that's called distributism and you got to tax somebody for something
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.220]   let's do it that way let's tax Warren Buffett he can afford it yeah it's with
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:06.700]   nothing just spit in the bucket so how about this this is the Guthrie theater
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:11.860]   in Minneapolis home of I think Prairie Home Companion isn't it they're gonna
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:17.980]   let you tweet from your seats oh brother the Guthrie theater is offering
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:23.940]   balcony level tweet seats allowing social means allowing social because you
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:26.780]   know when you go to the theater now they really they go on and on about turn
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:29.540]   off your phone don't use your phone we don't want to see your phone do not
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:34.340]   tweet from your seat so they said we're gonna make a special area to allow
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:41.740]   social media users an opportunity to interact during the movie I think it's a
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:45.620]   good idea because you know what that's just a promotional it's promotional put
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:49.780]   them up in the balcony promotional yeah let them tweet all they want who's
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:53.420]   behind this though because if you don't think about it what helps I mean what
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:56.940]   helps the movies what helps the movie studios is if people are out there
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:01.220]   tweeting about their movies if your friends are on social media saying that
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:05.260]   they loved you know they loved looper you're more likely to go see it I wonder
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:09.580]   if the movies the movie studios are behind this I think I don't know because
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:13.420]   you can get the same thing the opposite effect with this is the suckiest movie
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:18.460]   I've ever seen I'm watching out that's but you take it a bit or with a batter
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:24.300]   so but it's certainly a great opportunity for spoilers oh that's good
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:29.180]   with which we've already done James Bond fall 800 feet and die and then he
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:34.420]   come back to life I said this drunk I shouldn't said that I take it back it
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:37.580]   didn't happen you've seen this this is something they run at the Alamo draft
[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:41.100]   house we're just talking about it in Austin Texas what it says it the Alamo
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:44.860]   draft house we have a simple rule if you talk or text during a movie we kick
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:49.060]   you out sometimes that pisses the movie talker out what follows is an actual
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:54.940]   voicemail a customer left us after being kicked out
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:47:01.700]   because that's how I felt when I went to the Alamo draft house okay you know what
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:06.180]   I didn't know that wasn't supposed to text in your little crappy ass theater
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:11.980]   it was too dark in that place for me to find my seat all right I was using my
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:19.460]   phone as a flashlights get to my feet so excuse me for using my phone and USA
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:26.740]   magnetic states of America where you are free to text in a theater I was not aware
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:31.260]   that I couldn't text in your theater all right I've texted in all the other
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:36.180]   theaters in Austin and no one ever gave a fuck about what me I was doing my
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:43.540]   phone all right it wasn't on loud it was bothering anybody you guys obviously
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:50.300]   were being and I'm sure that's what you do you know to rip people off you take my
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:56.500]   money and then you throw me out you know I will never be coming back to your
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:00.740]   Alamo draft and that's why I'm so happy to have one and I'll tell you this is
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:06.060]   this is another one of the students of the University of Texas in Austin UT
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:12.940]   Oh long horns probably majoring in modern manners I think that's a good reason to
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:16.700]   go to the Alamo draft and by the way you know I want to you know I remember a
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:20.520]   couple years ago I was always soliciting these at 1 AA schools to send me out to
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:27.900]   hoodie North Dakota state Bisons won the 1 AA champion F.C. I'm now soliciting a
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:31.660]   hoodie from North Dakota state I'm thinking they have a great Buffalo on it
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:35.940]   it's a bison well it's on the run that's what we call a Buffalo now well they
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:41.140]   there's that they're the bison I think that's just saying anyone out there
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:45.180]   we're gonna take a break I used to know the difference between a buffalo and a
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:49.180]   bison but I don't think I know it anymore here in America we have bison but we
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:55.060]   call them Buffalo I think that's true no I was always taught that what we call
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:01.180]   Buffalo are are in fact bison and I think Buffalo in them in the United
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:04.740]   States but that's what they that's what they were shooting when they were driving
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:09.660]   the train across the prairie and the Cowboys would yeah they wish you a bison
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:14.260]   yeah yeah well we've got plenty of them over on Catalina Island if you want to
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:18.620]   go see some oh they're back baby do you live on Catalina Island no but it's
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:22.260]   easy to get to I love Catalina it's beautiful not a short walk though we
[01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:27.020]   actually have a problem but it's a pretty short flight it's short walk it's in
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:33.220]   the water I heard that okay apparently there's a there's a you can now hunt
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:37.660]   bison in Wyoming again yeah yeah because it's there's you're getting out of
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:42.900]   control they want to hunt those good eaten by the way oh yeah I love it yeah but
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:46.380]   that's farm raised bison no I don't know what the well was probably pretty good
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:51.500]   to make a little string maybe maybe yeah yeah how you cook them Bob but bison
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:54.620]   burger there you go you can run it up it's not gonna be stringing I would
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:59.660]   think that an animal that size would have to have a fair amount of exercise
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:04.860]   for the meat to be any good but perhaps not no no Jerry you're completely wrong
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:10.020]   that's why they they bring the cow these steer to the cat the corn bar and they
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:13.500]   stuff them with corn without letting them move I can go for an Erskine college
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:18.500]   booty depends on what it is you're what how you're cooking it of course if
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:24.620]   you like nearly raw stage yeah that's the proper way but if you tend to like
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:31.860]   things cooked I have a big green egg I heard that I love my big green egg yes
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:34.780]   you know do you have a big green egg Clayton you seem like a big green egg
[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:39.100]   guy oh I would you know we were up in the mountains and I saw one of these
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.980]   because I know that Alex Lindsey was talking about it last year and I said
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:47.020]   that's the thing Alex was talking about yeah but we had just bought a barbecue so
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:52.700]   I was not this isn't a bar but just a big green egg so is this the only thing
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:57.740]   that would work during an apocalypse yes in fact if there's an apocalypse I'm
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:02.660]   moving into the big green egg I'm gonna take my emergency kit I'm getting in the
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:08.100]   egg closing the lid I'll be safe yes John and Devorak org just you right now
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:17.100]   it's powered by unicorn tears and charcoal charcoal it's a charcoal it's
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:23.380]   good it looks it looks incredibly heavy it is 250 pounds you don't really want
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:27.340]   to lift it by yourself as I have tried and so what is that you have one of these
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:31.700]   at the house yeah but you cook on it you can always say that chicken you always
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:34.980]   tell me to come over and then you never give you the address no of course not
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:40.540]   I know you got to come over to the place I show today brought to you by hey audible
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:43.940]   dot com folks you know about audible I know about audible Jerry knows about
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:47.540]   audible because all of the great pornell niven novels are on audible dot com
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:51.860]   in fact it would be a sacrilege for me to recommend audible dot com without
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:57.620]   showing you the great books like the gripping hand the mode in God's eye
[01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:04.260]   Lucifer's hammer footfall Janissaries Beowulf's children the secret of black
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:09.620]   ship island the legacy of hero rot is how do you pronounce it hero row hero
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:16.180]   hero rod hero rod yes that's the name of the hall at Beowulf that was being
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:22.500]   attacked by Grindel and Beowulf came in and killed him I would say I like I'm a
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:25.620]   big fan of the Moten gods I would say start with Lucifer's hammer I love that
[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:31.260]   that's the one the asteroid hits the earth yeah I like that I like that I
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:36.460]   like that the earth is destroyed novel genre yeah I find this this this crazy
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:40.220]   that you you were into this kind of and then we have to rebuild from scratch you
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:43.020]   know why I like this because you make such a good point Jerry in this book
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:50.020]   that everybody uses technology but no one knows how it works so we were kind
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:54.420]   of living on this thin ice where we can't recreate this stuff because we don't
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:53:00.780]   understand it it's all magic it is actually magic well that's look Leo I
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:07.340]   hate to point this out but the last survey I saw shows that fewer than half
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:13.260]   the people of the United States know that the earth goes around the sun once a
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:18.820]   year I know I saw that too I was what that's right and of course we let them
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:28.140]   vote don't wait I saw that as good as your worth as much as yours most people
[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:33.460]   haven't the most people accept the benefits of civilization in the same way
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:37.980]   as a kitten except milk and with about the same amount of understanding yeah
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:44.020]   Lucifer's hand the Moten gods I this is a great one - about to moteies is in your
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:49.860]   daughter right it kind of my daughter wrote a sort of sequel it's actually
[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:54.700]   more just a story set in the moat universe it's called Aldi's and every
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:59.740]   but it's very good a lot of people like it a lot she wrote it all by herself I
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:04.020]   didn't have anything to do with it limited I gave her permission to do it but
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:09.260]   beyond that she was on her own and she's done it well of course my
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:13.180]   daughters are real bright girls so the gripping hand is a sequel to the
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:18.380]   Moten's God's Eye yes the gripping hand is the sequel that Niven and I wrote yeah
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:23.460]   I just this is all unaudible you means you can listen to these great things I own
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:27.620]   them as you can see Lucifer's hammer and the Moten God's Eye and I just enjoyed
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:32.020]   the heck out of them here's how you can get that but I can tell you I will add
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:36.900]   to your commercial here they the the readings are wonderful they have chosen

[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:15.020]   impression was of chaos screams above one helmsman's station showed the planet
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:18.380]   tell you when you get when you start listening this you just get sucked
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:21.580]   right in and you're going to drive around the block four or five more times
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:24.260]   just because you don't want to get out of the car it's that I mean I'm not
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:28.580]   kidding it's Jerry is contributing to the carbon dioxide problem in this country
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:34.060]   I thought it was just long now it's gonna be cap and trade with these books
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:38.980]   what do you think about this Samsung says it's not now some people said Samsung's
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:43.020]   gonna abandon Android they're so pissed off at Google for buying Motorola but
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:46.940]   they have confirmed they're gonna make a handsets based on a new version of
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:52.620]   Linux called Tizen yeah this is when they're working on yeah as was the
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:55.260]   Linux Foundation I mean this is it a kind of more official right there's
[01:56:55.260 --> 01:57:01.140]   another one yeah yeah Sam's on the other is these guys Samsung said the company
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:05.100]   plans to unveil competitive ties in devices within this year is it the end
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:08.500]   I mean Samsung makes so much money off Android right now is at the end of the
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:15.340]   Samsung Android Alliance or Jesus is just one more thing to do it will see
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:20.380]   out it's an experiment we'll see what happens Tizen I had to add to add to their
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:25.180]   mix have you played with Tizen's maybe played with it no no Ubuntu has
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:29.940]   announced Ubuntu for phones yeah Firefox has an OS I mean this is everybody's
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:33.740]   looking at the success of Android and saying hey there's an opportunity here
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:40.540]   Tizen has been put on a number of phones I think there's a video I saw of Tizen
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:45.860]   running on a Nexus or something I just think Google doesn't really make any
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:51.580]   money on Android no so what's the incentive for them to what's the incentive
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:56.420]   I mean Apple's incentive is the hardware well go no that's not strictly true
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:58:00.860]   Google wants you to use Android because they make money when you do use it
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:05.420]   because of course searches and all the you know Google has your your g-mail you're
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:08.340]   gonna do their own search engine I don't think so no they'll use Google that's
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:11.780]   right but they may not use Google mail in fact Samsung on its phones already
[01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:15.620]   puts its own mail its own calendar so they may start pulling people out of the
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:20.900]   Google universe and then maybe Google will come in again and make even better
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:25.740]   apps on Tizen than they will play Android that was a great article I was a
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:28.540]   great article a number of people have written now saying I don't even use
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:34.940]   Apple's apps anymore I Google is a Trojan horse on the iPhone they use g-mail
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:40.060]   use Google Maps use Google Calendar use Google you use Google context why you
[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:43.140]   know they're better than the Apple Maps and G+ is like a is one of the most
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:48.300]   gorgeous iOS apps of all yeah use that all the time if you're just
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:52.780]   sort of my first two home screens of a Google search Google Maps yep Google
[01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:59.860]   plus good point by one of our roaks forking is what Linux does best it's true
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:04.560]   it's true I'm sure there's a joke in there but I'm just I've had too much
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:08.980]   whiskey do you know it's got to do with contortionists
[01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:15.740]   it was the best it was the best sprint is also going to do pay as you go service
[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:21.100]   T mobile announced that they were going to start doing that this year I guess
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:25.540]   if you're not Verizon and AT&T you got to find an angle
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:33.700]   judge can't order of course not judge can't order a Yelp user to edit his
[01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:41.660]   negative review that's funny of Virginia woman after firing a contractor
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:46.820]   left a scathing review of the contractor of Virginia Supreme Court has
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:51.660]   overturned a preliminary injunction the contractor sued saying you've got to
[01:59:51.660 --> 02:00:00.220]   change that review the original court said yes the the high court said no
[02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:04.420]   judge judges shouldn't be able to edit or halt speech before illegal cases run
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:11.020]   its court so the injunction is no good but they will continue the suit they
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:15.340]   court ruled in December last month that the homeowner was required to edit her
[02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:20.900]   harsh comments on Yelp and Angie's list well that's not a great precedent no
[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:24.700]   unless and I mean unless she was libeling them or something I don't see
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:29.780]   the reason to that's the problem isn't it there are a lot of trolls out there
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:36.060]   who think that it's a great thing to just do a big negative review of anything
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:42.340]   something that gets them some attention I'm not sure they have much effect on
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:47.540]   readers because I think readers finally I think we know I pay that much attention
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:54.260]   to the reviews anymore we throw out there we throw out of the just silly bad
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:58.860]   reviews written in bad grammar and you begin to think well that's the way
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:04.980]   that's got rights then why do I want to pay attention to his opinions but it's
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:12.220]   a real problem sorting out liable from I'm in a some books deserve a bad review I
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:18.740]   suppose I may have even written one of them I don't think that books deserve bad
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:23.460]   reviews simply because somebody doesn't like the views that the author has on
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:28.340]   some subject utterly irrelevant to the book well I'm reminded I'm sorry but I'm
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:32.900]   reminded of the review of the French Laundry a one-star review given by a
[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:38.140]   vegan it's really because it didn't meet because they didn't have any you know
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:44.180]   they didn't have a special vegan menu yeah yeah this in this case she she went
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:49.340]   on to accuse the guy of stealing stuff from her where perhaps he didn't perhaps
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:55.020]   he did and the real issue of course is that regardless of whether or not this
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:58.380]   happened these this is the search result that you get when you search for his
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:04.340]   name yeah and better pat it with some good reviews like what do you do you
[02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:09.100]   inundate it with good reviews all fake and then you load up and then you push
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:12.580]   the bad review reviewed under the bottom yeah and then also give some money to
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:16.180]   the yelpers and they'll give they actually do I know that's kind of the
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:22.340]   corrupt part at least that's what I hear I don't know for sure I'd kind of
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:27.420]   think I just labeled them no they they they will move reviews around up for a
[02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:30.260]   fee that's what they used to do at least I don't know if they do it anymore I
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:33.460]   know that to Clayton you got to get going in fact we're making you late so I
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:37.660]   apologize we're gonna let you go I lost track of the time no worries here I
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:42.380]   was just glancing at the time yes yeah get over to that reporters confab and
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:48.060]   have some dried out shrimp and some of the lousy cheese they tell tell me that
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:54.740]   cheddar now John the one thing that Las Vegas has is shrimp must have a
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:58.780]   shrimp pool somewhere around there that we don't know okay they got a lot of
[02:02:58.780 --> 02:03:03.220]   good trees a regular flight shrimp in Las Vegas it's a one reason to go to
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:08.820]   come back and see yes and you can get all you can get a year's worth of
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:13.820]   shrimp in a couple of days I'm just jealous because planes gonna be having
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:17.180]   the time of his life while I'm driving back what tell us about your coverage
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:20.940]   is yes what are you gonna be doing I'm gonna be going to be drinking my parents
[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:25.660]   yeah well we'll be seeing you on Fox and friends all week long I'll be live
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:28.940]   there on Tuesday and Wednesday morning from the floor with Sean awesome
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:33.940]   latest and greatest and and I'll be on a live web show I think in 9 a.m.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:37.900]   Eastern time each day Tuesday and Wednesday for about a half an hour so
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:41.700]   be interviewing for some different CEOs and looking at some Gab just being Roman
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:47.100]   live a little bit around the floor like that but and this is why I we're not
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:50.260]   covering CES because people like Clayton are doing such a great job yeah
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.740]   there's no reason that him do all the work have fun Clayton it's so great to
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:57.820]   see you hey can I share one thing real quick with you yeah I've been waiting
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:00.900]   to share this with you and I don't think I have yet it's kind of I kind of kept it
[02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:04.860]   quite a little bit but I built an iPad app and I wanted to share it with you
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:09.140]   cool I was gonna see you I may talk about on Mac break weekly sometime but
[02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:15.740]   it's called read quick that's your app yeah oh my god that was a I wonder if
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:21.660]   Sarah Lane knew that we recommended that on iPad today this week oh how awesome
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:29.340]   and I mocked it did you really well tell us what it's the strangest app ever
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:33.220]   you mocked if I had known it was you Clayton I wouldn't have said that well
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:37.580]   no I mean so here's the best part here Jason Kackling the he knows about it
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:41.780]   no so what I did was I would read a few years ago I wanted to be able to you
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:46.380]   know just read tons of articles as much as I could for for for work you know I
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:52.260]   mean I have to be up on every possible angle of the news and and so wanted to
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:55.140]   do it quickly and I've been a fan of speed reading since I was a kid I was
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:58.820]   always obsessed with the science behind it so partnered up with with
[02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:04.420]   Instapaper and pocket and a great design team at Wonder Sauce helped me sort of
[02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:09.060]   realize that my friend Pablo is a great programmer we built it and so you can
[02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:13.820]   bring in your whole Instapaper list your pocket list and read it one word at a
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:20.620]   time okay that's the key one word at a time yeah so it's not you know it's not
[02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:24.180]   it's not splashing it up there in a sentence format or doing anything else
[02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:27.380]   it's one word at a time and so your comprehension you'll start out at like
[02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:30.260]   250 words a minute pretty soon you'll be up to like five hundred and fifteen
[02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:34.460]   words a minute so is it is it designed to help you read faster yeah it's a
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:37.780]   point of it that's the ancillary benefit of it which is it really helps you read
[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:41.740]   faster but it also lets you pla I'm getting emails from people that saying
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:45.060]   I've now I'm able to get through my whole Instapaper queue and I've never been
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:49.620]   able to do one okay let me just show you because I have it on my iPad let me
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:53.140]   just show you I'm gonna take an article this is it no do it on my do it on my
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:57.460]   thing how do you cut your face where is my screen where the hell is it
[02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:01.940]   there we're working on there we go okay and on watch I'm gonna tap this John
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:08.900]   watch I'm watching okay we just try to better okay and it gets now how do I
[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:13.900]   speed it up click now slide I just it's a double tap the screen again and then
[02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:16.740]   see the little slider down I can do it up here that's right so let's get a little
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:22.020]   so as you get better you actually can read pretty fast 500 words a minute
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:27.980]   yeah yeah I mock this because I this is not how I want to read an article
[02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:32.500]   but you can pla I just pretty readable thing and then if you want to read just
[02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:36.260]   it in normal parts text like you would an Instapaper a pocket you just simply
[02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:38.740]   hit view source and you take you right to the web if you want to read it that
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:42.220]   way but for me you know if you have for doctors and for individuals who want to
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:46.260]   be able to have to read like tons of articles every week in the medical
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:49.380]   profession that want to pla through all these things and your comprehension
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:52.660]   actually goes up because you get your your verbalizing of the words out of the
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:07:00.980]   way I this is so funny because I totally totally mocked this on now now you can
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.940]   Sarah know that this is your program because she could have told me I don't
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:08.660]   look I finished the article already yeah that was a fantastic article wasn't
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:11.980]   that great let's go read some more you know the thing is what if you don't want
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:16.180]   to read the article fear and loathing on Windows 8 ladies and gentlemen
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:21.260]   five hundred five words per minute I was very excited when I saw that so you
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:25.220]   can't read this fast now I thought you wait and I thought the whole level of
[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:30.300]   what idea was to read a clump at a time not a word at a time no and so what
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:33.380]   one of the in a future update we're working on some people requested that
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:37.700]   you know that they would love to see like 15 letter words be able to like slowly
[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:42.500]   pause that's that something we're working on and you know me
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:48.740]   why are you snoring oh what no you should just keep reading I put me to
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:53.180]   sleep I just know articles boring oh it's a bad article all right well anyway so

[02:07:57.140 --> 02:08:00.580]   Clayton I would not have mocked it I would have said hey oh no hey this is a
[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:07.420]   wonderful wonderful playing favorites remember back when while we were using
[02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:13.940]   modems and you started reading 300 baud and then 1200 and then 2400 and you
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:17.860]   actually learned to read faster because it would detect you were keeping up
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:23.860]   with the the text this is a visualization of it not that's a pretty good idea so
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:27.980]   this was this is 2400 baud right now
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:32.220]   stop Clayton get get out of here thank you so much for sticking around we love
