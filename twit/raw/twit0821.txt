[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   It's time for Twit!
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   This week in Tech, Brianna Wu is here.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.700]   Nate Langston is here from Bloomberg.
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.000]   He's all the way from the UK.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   And it's been a long time.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Tim Stevens is back from Upper New York State
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.600]   and seen its road show.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.000]   Lots to talk about.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.400]   A big, big quarter for big tech.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.800]   A big year for big tech.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400]   They made a ton of money.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400]   Is this going to encourage scrutiny?
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.000]   Maybe.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.200]   We'll talk about Apple's App Store.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700]   They sure make a lot of money.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.200]   The EU says maybe it's because they're monopoly.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   We'll talk about air tags.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.700]   Are they a privacy concern?
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.200]   Can you be stocked with them?
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.200]   And then Brianna Wu gives up some of her Resident Evil secrets
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.700]   for speedrunning.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.200]   From people you trust.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200]   This is Twit.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   This is Twit.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:04.200]   This week at Tech.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.200]   Episode 821, recorded Sunday, May 2nd, 2021.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700]   Bring in the privacy pod.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700]   This week at Tech is brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.200]   If you really want to go incognito and protect your privacy,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.700]   make yourself as invisible as possible.

[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.700]   Finding someone to wear many hats or one very specific hat
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.200]   is no easy task.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200]   ZipRecruiter finds people with the right experience for your job
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   and invites them to apply.

[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   [music]
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech, the show we cover the week.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   Tech news and I always love the one show I do every week
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   where the panel is different every week.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   And that makes it fun for me.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Partly because I get to catch up with people I haven't seen in ages.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   Like Tim Stevens, oh my God, how long has it been?
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   It's been a couple of years it feels like.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   It seems like it's been a real long time.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   I'm glad to be here with you.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   It's great to see you.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   I apologize.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   He's of course the editor in Chief of CNET's Roadshow,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   editor in large at CNET.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   And a car buff.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   And since you're a car buff,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   I thought I'd bring somebody along who has no car.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   Nate Langston, Tech editor from Bloomberg.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   He's in the UK and the host of Bloomberg's Quick Take,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   which is really cool.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   It's kind of a global news site.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   Thank you.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   I bet you're doing well, right?
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   It is doing very well.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   I've actually just shot an episode where we are ripping
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   well, joining the engineers who are ripping all the Huawei
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   kits out of these five G towers.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   Wow.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   So that's going to go out next week.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   That's a huge story.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   That's fascinating.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   But I have to introduce the third member of our panel.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   I saved my favorite for last.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   Well, you're all my favorites.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   But Brianna Wu, I love seeing Brianna Wu.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Former candidate for Congress, former game developer,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   Space Cat Gale, who can forget,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   and now executive director of rebellionpack.com
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   political action committee.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   Hello, Brianna.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   I just want to say, current game developer,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   I can't tell you what I'm working on.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   Oh.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   Oh.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   Oh.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   Thank you, Nick.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   You don't think I bought a $7,000 machine just to sit here in my house.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   Is that the iMac Pro you're talking about?
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   No, no, no.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   This is, I put together a monster machine,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   AMD Threadripper 24 cores, AMD 3090,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   just absolute monster machine.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   We're, Tim Stevens, are you in the AMD club or the Intel club?
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   I'm rocking Intel at the moment.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   Aww.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   Oh, because Brianna and I both have, she's got a little bit more powerful.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   Threadripper, I only have eight cores on my 5900X,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   but it's a very, I have to say, I'm very impressed.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   And I only got the 3080, not the 3090, but boy,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   it really looks good.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   And I'm driving a big 4K display, an OLED, which is really nice.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   And I have to say, it's not just for gaming anymore.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   It's really nice to have, I'm running Linux, so I have a tile,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   a tile window manager, so I have four different 1080p windows open
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   at the same time and they're big.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   And it's just, I'm loving life.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   Desktops aren't dead, I know they're dead, but they don't feel like they're dead.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   I don't think they're dead.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   Well, for developers, for specialized uses, but I think PC sales are almost all laptops, aren't they these days?
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   No.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   I doubt it.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   And tablets are booming too, so yeah, it's interesting to see.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   I'm doing sim racing myself and I just upgraded to Vive 2 HD 4K.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   Oh, you're doing the VR thing.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   So I stepped up from a Rift S to Vive 2 and there's a lot more pixels I gotta push now, so that's what I need a little more horsepower on the computer.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   I have the original Vive at home.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   You know, my kid, my 18-year-old does it, but it doesn't, I can't.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   What do you play?
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   Mostly iRacing and I set up a competition.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   Oh, of course.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   So sim racing is pretty much all that I'm up to these days.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   So if you're a real racer, I know you do ice racing.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   How close is the VR game to actual racing?
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   It's pretty amazing how close it can be, especially with this newer sim, I set up course at competency.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   Oh, and the physics engine is unbelievable.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   They measure the tire temperature down to three different positions within the rubber, for example, to give an idea of how in-depth this physics engine is.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   And the feel, the sound, especially in VR, it's really, really engaging.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   And I also do a lot of rally racing and when you're doing that, then you constantly need to be looking over your shoulder as you're sliding around a corner.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   And so even if you have like a triple monitor set up, it doesn't really work very well.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   But as soon as you get into VR, now you can look anywhere you want to.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   It's like you're in the car.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   It's much more engaging.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   It's a lot more fun, a lot more engaging.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   And yeah, I love it.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   I love your opinion on this, but for me, you know, because I do track days too.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   And I feel like the disconnect, I personally feel when I try sim racing is so much of doing a track day well, I feel, is getting to know the G-Force and what it is.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   And when you're tires are going to break, that to me is so much of the skill of it.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   And when you're doing it in VR, you don't have, like you have steering wheel feedback, but you just don't feel it in the same way.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   It's bizarre.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   I can be like racing my own literal track car in one of these racing simulators.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   And I just suck at it.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   And it's because of that lack of feedback.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   It really is learning.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   I mean, the mechanics are much the same, the reactions that you need are much the same, but which the feedback that you're looking for is very different now.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   It's really about what you hear and what you see.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   So you need to learn to kind of pick up the real, tiny changes in perspective that you get when your car starts to slide.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   And yeah, force feedback wheels do help as well, but really it's about sound and vision.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   And that's why I think VR again helps, but it's also why a hybrid solid framerate is really important because if your framerate is stuttering at all, then that throws off your perception of what the car is doing.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   And that makes it really, really difficult to stay at it.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.200]   Do you want to talk about bicycling or anything, Nate?
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   I like bikes too.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   I'm a bicycle.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   I run all the time.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   Okay, let me tell you that.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   So I actually bought a bike about nine months ago.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   It's by this Belgian, I think the Belgian company called Cowboy.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   And I liked it because it's partly electric and it has blue cheese pancakes.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   I love you, bikes.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   Oh my God.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   So it felt like a toy, but it still doesn't do all the work for you, so it helps me get fit.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   So it's kind of the best of both worlds.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   I didn't want a basic, you know, basic push bike.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   And I also didn't want something that was just going to, you know, like a motorcycle, like a basic motorcycle or something like that.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   I just wanted something that was a bit of both.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   And I think these electric bikes have really come on a long way.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   I love it.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   I really love it.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   I'm not going crazy journeys with it and I'm mostly using it for pleasure.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   But it's great because I can use it on the road and I can cycle through the forest that we've gotten in here.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   That's pretty cool.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   Sounds great.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   Well, I've glued you all to your seats so that you can't go anywhere.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   While we talk about the week's tech news, I'm sorry, it's just not as interesting, but that's what we're going to talk about today.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   This was a big week for tech companies and quarterly results.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   All of the tech companies had phenomenal quarterly results, right?
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   Microsoft, Apple, Google, all making a ton of money.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   It actually is interesting.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   There was an article about big tech in the New York Times.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   It pointed out that in 2020, now that we have all the results out for 2020, when you combine the revenues,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   yearly revenues of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook, $1.2 trillion,
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   that's gross of 25% over last year.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   In less than one week, those five companies make more in sales than McDonald's does in a year.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   They are behemoths.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   Of course, always concomitant with this kind of success, then there's both public upset
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   and there's regulatory scrutiny.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   This week, Apple got the charges from the EU that the app store is a monopoly.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   This is at the behest of Spotify.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   Anti-trust violations in the Spotify case.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   There's Marta Vista here, the Competition Commission at the EU.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   She's really become the pit bull against a big tech in the United States.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   EU regulators say Apple squeezed rival music streaming apps.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   Spotify, which is where this came from.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   By requiring them to use Apple's in-app payment systems to sell digital content,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   they also say Apple distorted competition, that's the phrase they used,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   by limiting how app developers can inform users about cheaper ways to subscribe.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   This is a long-standing problem.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   Amazon didn't sell books in the Kindle store on iOS.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   When they had the temerity to say, "Oh, by the way, you can buy these books on Amazon.com."
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   Apple said, "You can't say that."
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   Apple's in-payment system, of course, charges 30% for most people.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   They've now lowered that for people that make more than a million dollars a year,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   which is all the big boys, to 15%.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   There's a second data point on this.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   I don't know how much credibility to give it, but, you know,
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   Apple's in tomorrow.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   Apple's going to go to court with Epic.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   The big battle has begun.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   Epic has hired an expert to analyze documents obtained from Apple in discovery.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Ned Barnes, he's a financial and economics researcher, said Apple has a 78% margin
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   in the App Store.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   It's a 78% profit.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   Is Apple's App Store...
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   It's obviously a problem for Apple now.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   They're getting a lot of scrutiny.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.200]   But is there a good reason for it to be a problem, Brianna?
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   Is there something wrong with the way Apple's doing it?
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   Well, I think this is a hard situation to talk about, right?
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   Like, no one, as a fan of iOS or the Apple ecosystem,
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   wants them to open this up to competitors.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   Part of what keeps all of us safe is, you know,
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   the curation and the limiting of who's able to run apps in the App Store.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   Just to really be frank with you, Leah, the only reason I stay on iOS is the privacy.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   There's no other reason.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   It's not the features, it's not the hardware.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   So that's one side of it.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   On the other, I think it's really increasingly difficult to say, you know,
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   Apple deserves that high a cut.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   What value are they really producing to earn that 30%?
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   It's not payment processing, which is cheaper than ever.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   It's not really discovery because the App Store tends to favor the biggest fish
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   and, you know, people that can afford to do their own marketing.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   What are they providing here?
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   As far as the profit itself, wow, stunner, headline, monopolies
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   are insanely profitable.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   Who would have known that?
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   So, you know, I think that if Apple doesn't want to be increasingly
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   under the gun of regulators, I think it would be smart of them to bring that down
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   to a margin that frankly doesn't seem as exploitive.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   The number 78% isn't confirmed by Apple.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   In fact, they asked the judge, can we not talk about this?
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   They literally said to the judge, your honor,
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   not talk about this.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   I don't know, the judge hasn't ruled yet, but somehow I feel like that might be
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   material in the Epic case.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   Apple's services segment, according to Apple's own quarterly results,
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.200]   services includes Apple App Store, but other things is 70%.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   The gross margin for its products is 36%.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   This is an incredibly profitable company making an awful lot of money,
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   but is that illegal?
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Nate, what do you think?
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   You're from the former member of the EU.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   Yeah, I follow this stuff closely.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   And frankly, Apple's hardware margins on iPhone used to be a lot higher
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   than they used to be.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   I think they were even comparable to some of the margins that we're talking about
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   for App Store that this analyst was discussing.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   Wow, when you combine services and products, the total gross margin for the quarter
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   was 42.5%.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   That's a phenomenally successful company.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   I know my company is not nearly so profitable, but I would guess most
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   companies would be very happy with anything above 10%, maybe 20%, 42.5%.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   Wow.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   But I think there's a few ways of looking at it because on the one hand
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   you could say, well, there's nothing wrong with a company being profitable,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   making money.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   That's kind of what capitalism is predominantly all about.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   The question is whether it's being abused and whether it could have,
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   rather, rather that profitability and that market position is being abused.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   And if so, what needs to change in order for it not to be?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   And I don't believe that the EU is going to take as much of an issue with
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   the profitability of the App Store from the perspective that, well,
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   you could just make less profit.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   And actually it will come down to, well, are you artificially prohibiting people
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   who depend on your App Store from circumventing your payment platform?
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   So if you look at what Apple did with the Sign In with Apple system,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   where if you offer a sign in with Facebook or Google, you have to also
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   offer sign in with Apple, Apple can push the benefits of choosing Apple over
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   the others by saying, well, look, it's more private.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   It's faster.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   It uses Face ID to authenticate.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.200]   It's not just typing in your password, all of which is true.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   And it offers a user that ability to say, well, I'm going to choose Apple to do this
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   because it's faster and more convenient.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   If Apple were to be forced or choose to allow another form of payment system
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   within an app, essentially the user, as Epic demonstrated with the Fortnite case,
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   that kind of spearhead a lot of this stuff, that you know, you give someone a choice
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   and they can go with Apple and it might cost more money,
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   but it's tied into the payment system.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   It's done without going to a separate web page like when you have to pay with PayPal
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   or something.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   Like you could see that, well, there's a legitimate argument that people are still
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   going to use Apple because it's just faster and more convenient.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   So I think that is probably what will end up being talked about a lot more than just
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   the sheer profitability.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   I mean, if you want to look at profit margins, look at the fashion industry, it's crazy.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   That's a good point.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   I mean, I roll like swatch is very much more than 42% profit.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   I'm sure.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   So I think that's what it all, it probably will come down to.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   And just one other thing that I thought is worth pointing out is this reminds me a lot
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   of the conversation that went around at the sort of turn of the millennium with Microsoft
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   and it's antitrust, with the EU.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   Exactly.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   Very much so.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   You know, yeah, I mean, but the result for Microsoft was essentially that it lost its ground
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   on a lot of products and like browsers, obviously in particular, I think Windows Media
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   Player suffered.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.800]   And I think that kind of had a knock on effect that Microsoft was maybe less willing to be
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.720]   as aggressive in pushing its products against competitors than it may otherwise have would
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.200]   have if it wasn't scared of antitrust.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.600]   And I'm going to be looking out for whether whatever the result of this happens, whatever
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   decisions made, whatever appeals are made or overturned, is whether this changes Apple's
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:04.080]   aggressive pursuit of dominating its ecosystem or whether it will eventually end up seeding
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.120]   ground in a way Microsoft did.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.640]   And I think that's going to be fascinating.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.760]   I'm sure there'll be debate over this, but I agree with you.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:18.720]   I think even though the DOJ Microsoft battle, which went on for almost a decade ended up,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.760]   you know, kind of in a draw, it tempered Microsoft's aggression.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.640]   But certainly, I think you make a strong case that Google, for instance, might not have
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.400]   existed if Microsoft hadn't been more careful about entering markets.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.520]   You can also make the case that it's not been bad for Microsoft that they have, as a result,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.200]   found new areas to make money in.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.760]   And that's actually, I don't think you can look at Microsoft today and say they suffered
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.720]   because of what happened in the late '90s and the early 2000s with the DOJ.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.760]   I mean, the company's worth over $2 trillion at this point.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   And it lost the Windows Phone Battle.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.200]   I mean, if you were looking at an example of maybe how Microsoft would have approached
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.040]   a market opportunity more aggressively where it not for fears over antitrust, look at Windows
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   phone.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   Perfect.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.960]   Like that was not a product that should have failed, really.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.360]   It had everything going for it in terms of the people who could have pushed it harder
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.360]   and didn't.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   That's interesting.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   It lost out.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.640]   I have never heard anybody say that's why they lost the Windows Phone Market.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.400]   You know, usually it's the carrier stores in the US that are blamed for not--
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.000]   I don't think exclusively, I think, used just a pop.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   It makes sense.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   There were other things wrong with it.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.960]   Microsoft certainly was chastened and was much less aggressive.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.920]   In a way, we've lost because it would be great to have another standard besides iOS
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920]   and Android.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.840]   And it was, I think, when it was fun was great.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.720]   So the consumer has lost a little bit, but I don't think a less rapacious Microsoft
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.200]   is a bad thing in general overall.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.760]   I just want to come back to this issue.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.320]   I think because I'm looking at the Club Twitch chat, I don't think any of us here begrudge
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:02.280]   any tech company for doing very well and making a lot of money.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.040]   I don't think anyone here has any kind of problem with that.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.800]   My interest in this really begins and ends when you have companies that are so large
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.160]   that we cannot continue to have innovation in the tech industry.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   And I think we have to be asking ourselves, could you launch another Facebook today without
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.760]   that being gobbled up by Facebook?
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:30.040]   Could you have a really strong hardware manufacturer come along today with an operating system
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.200]   and compete with Apple or Microsoft?
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:39.320]   I think that answer is increasingly probably not.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.960]   So my only interest here is making sure we can continue to foster innovation in the tech
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.560]   industry because if we don't, this thing that all of us love, it's just going to stack
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.560]   me.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.160]   And I think we are unfortunately seeing that in many ways.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.160]   Competition.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.520]   And even for those startups who do fit within this ecosystem, who could write an app that
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:04.280]   will fit within App Store guidelines now need to make 30% additional margins on their end
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.320]   just to break even because of the high fees that Apple is charging.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.240]   I mean, if you think of your average retail space, there isn't a shopping mall on the
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.000]   planet that would take 30% off of all the sales of any of their stores and expect for those
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   stores to survive.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.840]   But that's exactly what Apple is doing.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.320]   And it's hard for that to not look egregious.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.640]   And regarding margins, I love that Apple's response to the margins wasn't this is invalid
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   or this is wrong.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.280]   It was, we actually don't calculate that and we can't calculate that.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   Which is totally BS.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.280]   Of course they calculate.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.280]   Of course they know that.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.280]   No, no.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.400]   This because they don't report it doesn't mean they don't have a number ready.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   We don't know.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   We have no idea how much we make.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   No idea at all.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.160]   By the way, they're spending $90 billion to buy back stock.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.440]   They announced that as well in the quarterly results.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.600]   That's a huge amount.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.320]   And that will of course inflate the stock price even further, which means that people
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.840]   who own Apple stock, probably members of Congress, will be very well disposed towards
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   Apple.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   It also means that employees will get bigger stock grants and so forth and so on.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:12.680]   But in the club Twitch chat, they are pointing out that the cost isn't to Spotify or Amazon,
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.920]   it's to you because in most cases companies just pass along this 30% to the consumers.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:25.240]   So Joe's saying when you buy YouTube premium on the web, it's 12 bucks when you buy it
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.920]   on the Apple store, it's 16 bucks and on and on and on and that actually kind of makes
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.920]   sense.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.400]   But there are some services that aren't available elsewhere.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.160]   If you're buying a premium app, a game, something like that, and you can only get it through
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.040]   the app store, then you don't have an option.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.280]   There's no way around it.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.240]   So that premium is certainly is baked in there.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.840]   It is being passed on to the user.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.040]   But if the app is 30% higher, more expensive than it would be otherwise, then do you expect
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.600]   to have 30% fewer sales?
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   Probably so.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.200]   The funny thing is, and this is why it's so hard to cover, Apple is this mixed bag.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.720]   Because as you said, Brianna, you use it because it's privacy focused.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.400]   I would say you could argue that the app store makes it a more secure, I think the iPhone
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.120]   is a more secure platform, whether it's the app store or Apple's engineering or the fact
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.600]   that it's such a closed system compared to Android, but for whatever reason, I think
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.720]   it feels a lot safer.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:29.880]   And then Apple is this week, Apple released iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, which is sticking it
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:38.000]   to Facebook with their application tracking switches and their privacy statements.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.720]   All of a sudden companies like Google and Facebook have to admit they're gathering huge
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.320]   amounts of information.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.280]   And consumers get to decide, A, whether they want to let them continue to do that and B,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.600]   whether they want to use WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, maybe I'm going to use something
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.760]   else because I'm looking at the privacy statement and comparing it to Signal.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.160]   And I don't want to give up that information.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.240]   So Apple's doing some real good, right?
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.480]   We agree with this new ATT stuff.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.600]   Take it for a former political fundraiser, the amount of information I can get on you
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.440]   from your Facebook account is it would it would horrify you if you really found out about
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.800]   it just from your Facebook account.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   Well, now people are.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   Exactly.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   They're horrified.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.280]   You could do list matching with it.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.400]   I can ultimately find out your address.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.320]   I can find out what your interests are.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.040]   I can find out what website she visited because all this is collated.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.000]   And I have to tell you, they sell it for a song.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.040]   They sell it for an insultingly low amount.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:46.200]   So, you know, I think having seen how the sausage is made, you better believe.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.760]   I was, I was sitting there waiting for them to update it on my iPhone.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:56.440]   I'm like, install now, install now because this is, it's, it's such an obvious step forward.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:02.120]   I think it's really sad that, you know, Google is probably not going to do this on Android
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.680]   because I think in many ways that's an ecosystem that needs this even more.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:12.640]   This week, Apple also released its air tags, something that the company Tyle, which is up
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.560]   to now has been the leader in Bluetooth tracking tags.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.560]   Has been very afraid of.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.360]   Tyle CEO has testified before Congress saying, "App, Apple's going to put us out of business.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.880]   They're going to use their market clout.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.680]   They're going to use the fact that there's a billion iPhones out there to completely dominate
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.040]   and it's happening."
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:36.400]   Apple, two weeks before they released air tags, did open the Find My System.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   Another Bluetooth tracker, Chipolo agreed to support it.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.840]   Keeping these guys much of the benefit that air tags have, but it's very hard to compete
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:51.000]   against a Bluetooth tracker that uses the fact that there are a billion iPhones out there,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.280]   all of which will be, you know, keeping an eye out for your lost keys.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.320]   That's a tough thing to compete with.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.040]   And this is the problem.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.320]   You want Apple to innovate.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.720]   You want Apple to do these things.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.800]   You want them to be good.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.000]   You want them to make money.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.640]   You just don't want them to use their monopoly position to kill competition or disadvantage
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   consumers.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.320]   And it's difficult to think of, for instance, the solution to the App Store that would somehow
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.960]   fix this problem.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.280]   Putting a third-party App Store is not going to change things dramatically.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.280]   I don't know.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.520]   I think there is an easy fix.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.320]   I think let people put their own payment systems in the App Store and let the consumer make
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   their choice.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   They choose Stripe instead of Apple Pay and not give Apple a 30% big.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.000]   They do it through Safari and put their credit card details in or they use Apple Pay.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Do the same in the apps.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.680]   And I think, you know, a huge part of this problem just goes away overnight.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.960]   They should do that because you know what?
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.040]   People are still going to use Apple Pay by a vast majority are still going to use it because
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.080]   it's easy in fingerprinting or a face ID and you're done.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.680]   I want to pay for my Apple Music subscription with my Dogecoin.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.640]   Well, I would hold on.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:07.960]   You don't want to be that person who sold, bought an album for $5 million with Dogecoin.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:14.000]   Now that Elon Musk and Mark Cuban are saying, "Dogecoin is the next big crypto," how much
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.720]   Dogecoin do you have, Rian?
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.480]   Oh, I would never have Dogecoin.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.240]   I have a lot of Bitcoin.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.320]   You should have got the Dogecoin.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.840]   You got to get on the Dogecoin train.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.240]   Christina made bank.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.480]   Christina made so much money from the Bitcoin.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   She has to have to have a real coin.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   It is obscene.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.240]   She bought it on a lark.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.080]   For me, if you look at Dogecoin, the very thing that makes Bitcoin valuable in the long
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.520]   term, like the fact that they're not going to have more of it, probably, you know, Dogecoin
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.080]   is the opposite of that.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.880]   Like, look into the architecture before you sweat serious money in this.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.600]   If you want to play a short game, more power to you, but you're destroying the planet for
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   something.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.600]   Well, that's another problem.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   It probably has no value.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   That's another problem entirely.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:03.040]   So, this year is up 5,000%.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.520]   It may hit cryptocurrency experts say a dollar.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.440]   How much did Christina have?
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.440]   Did she sell it?
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.120]   Like I was holding it.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   She sold a ton of it.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.520]   We're like, "Christia, just cash out.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.280]   Go get a new M2 Mac or M1 Mac, iMac.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.480]   Like get it.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.880]   Have something that's real from this.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   Enjoy your trip.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.400]   We're talking about Christina Warren, who's your co-host and Rocket and of course, what
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   are you doing?
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.200]   Well, I'm a regular on our show and she's a developer advocate at Microsoft, but she
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   wants an M1.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   Okay.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.320]   What kind of guy behind Dogecoin didn't he work at IBM?
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.560]   It was a joke.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   It was...
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.560]   The Doge meme.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   It was a meme.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   Very Doge.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   Yeah, very doge.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560]   Such value.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.560]   Yeah, such a...
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.560]   Wow.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.360]   I know our own father, Robert, had quite a bit of Dogecoin, but I think he dumped it
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.720]   when it got to like 10 cents.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.640]   He had no idea it was going to get to 38 cents.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   Great.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.480]   So I think there's a really interesting question around all this just to be slightly tangential
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.200]   to the news for a sec, which is...
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   Please.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.040]   There is a lot of people now because of the popularity of Bitcoin over the last year,
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   in particular.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.520]   You know, we're seeing on the sides of buses, we're seeing it on top of taxis and stuff.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.440]   Like get a Bitcoin account, get into crypto.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:27.200]   There are going to be a lot of people who acquire crypto and then die and people are
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.800]   going to want to get access to that money.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.600]   And that's really difficult to do.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   And I wrote a...
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.680]   Oh, you mean actually literally die?
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   Not...
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   Yeah, they're going to...
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   They're going to buy Doge...
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:42.240]   How do you hand down your Dogecoin or your Bitcoin?
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   Well, this is the thing.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.400]   There are ways to do it.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.680]   I gave my son my Bitcoin wallet, but that's only because...
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.000]   And by the way, there's eight Bitcoin in it, but that's only because I can't remember
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   the password.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.640]   So he gave up by trying to crack it.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.040]   See, that's a big problem.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.720]   I wrote a feature for Business Week a few years ago and spoke to a guy who...
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.240]   I mean, it was very sad.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.680]   His son was killed in a plane crash.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.040]   But they don't know his password.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.600]   But he bought Bitcoin within the first few weeks or something of it existing and it would
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.880]   have been worth a lot of money.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.600]   But there's just no way to access it.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.000]   And I think we're going to see a lot of that.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.760]   And I'm very interested to see whether it's inheritance.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.480]   People who are writing wills and insurance and stuff, like, how are they going to respond
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.240]   to the fact that a lot of average person in the street is going to have a bunch of crypto
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.880]   and they're going to want to have to protect it.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.920]   I think they're going to see a lot of stuff happening.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:42.760]   Charlie Munger, who is a Warren Buffett's partner at Berkshire Hathaway, calls Bitcoin
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.960]   disgusting and bad for civilization.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.000]   I saw this.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.680]   I saw this and I'm like, I agree with every word you're saying, yes, you're dead on.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.400]   And yet I'm making so much money for the money.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   I'm going to get free a day.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   Oh, that's right.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   You're mining.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   That's what you're using that rig for.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.800]   And now I understand.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.400]   Is it pay for itself?
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   I bought it to game.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   And then, you know, Christina, like for rocket segment, we were like, can you make money
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.600]   through cryptocurrency mining?
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.200]   I was just curious about it.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:23.520]   So I set it up to do Ethereum mining with NiceMiner and Leo, I swear, even subtracting
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.880]   electricity costs, I make $35 a day, I mean, every couple of days.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.880]   That's pretty good.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.880]   Doing crypto mining.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.880]   That's your profit.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   Like, that's real.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.600]   I think electricity is so expensive in California.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.960]   I don't know how viable that would be, but maybe in Massachusetts, it's not as expensive.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.240]   Especially once I get solar panels in my house.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.160]   Well, we have 60 solar panels and two Tesla batteries.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.280]   I guess I probably should be mining with that rig instead of playing Valheim.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   I am mining.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.720]   I mean, I have a pickaxe and I'm digging a troll trench, but I don't know if that counts
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.240]   as Bitcoin.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.200]   Here's the quote.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.600]   Oh, I don't know if my, we never tested my audio.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:05.120]   We're going to do this every time on this on a computer that seems to revert its settings
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.120]   every time.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120]   Okay, I think it's okay.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.760]   Let me play this audio from the Berkshire Hathaway meeting this week.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.360]   Well, this is Charlie Munger.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:24.280]   Those who know me well are just waving the red flag of the bull.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   Of course I hate the Bitcoin success.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.560]   I don't welcome a currency that's so useful and the kidnappers and extortionists and so
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.560]   forth.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:41.280]   Nor do I like just shuffling out a few extra billions and billions.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.160]   By the way, I got to point out this is at the Berkshire Hathaway meeting because they
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   own C's candy.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.040]   There's a big box of peanut brittle and because they looks like, is that Coca-Cola?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.680]   I think they're big in Coca-Cola as well.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.120]   There are a couple of cans of Coca-Cola and some Fiji water on there.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.880]   They don't mind plugging their own stuff.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:03.040]   It's dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   Dogecoin.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.680]   So they should have asked about Dogecoin.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:12.040]   I think I should say modestly that I think the whole damn development is disgusting and
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.720]   contrary to the interests of civilization.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.120]   I'll leave the criticism to others.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   Wow.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:27.760]   More in Buffett says, I'm okay on that one.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.600]   You know, I have to say when you watch this, these guys are older than me.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.680]   That's pretty old.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.320]   It really feels like the old generation, well, there's nothing wrong with stocks.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   Looking at the new generation, you kids and your crazy crypto currencies, maybe, I don't
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.800]   know, a fiat currencies fiat currency.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:55.480]   I don't think Bitcoin's any sketcher than any other cryptocurrency or fiat currency.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.240]   I feel like there's a cultural element to it.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.120]   There is the environmental impact though.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   We can't ignore that.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   It's terrible.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.400]   I want to be really clear.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.840]   I am a monster for participating in this.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.240]   You're burning hydrocarbons, pumping them into the air so you can make your crappy 35
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.240]   bucks a day.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   Thank you.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   I'm ashamed of you, Breanne.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.720]   I feel bad about her, really.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.160]   And then I buy some Chipotle for lunch.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.200]   She drives her Porsche Boxster around.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.200]   Okay, no problem.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:32.920]   No, but I wanted to say I think that part of the reason this is grabbed so much of the
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:40.480]   cultural zeitgeist, especially with millennials and people younger, is I think there's a growing
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:46.280]   sense that the financial industry is fundamentally corrupt.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.640]   And I think there's a sense that this is the way we get rich.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.920]   This is our time.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.440]   This is our scheme.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:02.120]   And I think it's about, I think, so much of the Bitcoin fever, I think it's about a resentment
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.920]   about a monetary system that works for the Warren Buffet's of the world.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.960]   And isn't working for a lot of people under 40?
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.440]   Yeah, totally great.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.520]   And if you look at the GameStop stock manipulation, it's exactly the same thing.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.880]   It's a lot of younger people saying, "We can manipulate the market as well.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.560]   This system has been stacked against us for so long.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.000]   But if we get together, we can actually make this work and we can show just how ridiculous
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.200]   this entire thing is."
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.000]   And I think that really shed a lot of light on people's perspectives in terms of investment
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.320]   crypto versus a traditional stock market investment.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.000]   That everything is kind of imaginary.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.240]   Everything is built on faith.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.960]   Everything is built on what everybody else is doing.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.240]   So there's no reason to think that one thing is inherently more valuable than something
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   else.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   It's all just numbers on a screen.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   At this point, it's bits.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   It's not even anything.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   It's just bits.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.680]   It's all bits.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.720]   And Nate, you wanted to mention this.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:03.480]   Apple, instead of doing what you thought maybe Microsoft did under all that scrutiny, backing
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.040]   off has really doubled down there.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:13.640]   Apparently about to launch lossless streaming on Apple Music competing with, "Does Spotify
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   even have lossless?
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.480]   I know these are entitled to or have high bit rate anyway.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.120]   I have a classical music subscription, Prime Fonic, which is lossless."
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   Oh, yes.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.000]   Spotify launched lossless in February.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.360]   Spotify, high fight.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:37.680]   Because yeah, I mean, there's the lossless aspect and then there's higher res, which
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.120]   is something that title, I think title does it.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:49.400]   I know that if you download from Bandcamp, I know that stuff's high res because I recently
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:55.360]   bought a new album by the family friendly band, Cannibal Corpse, which is in high res.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.160]   And I didn't realize until I got the file.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.520]   And I was like, wow, this is 24-bit.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.640]   You never want lossy compression on an animal corpse.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   I'm just saying.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   Cannibal Corpse.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   I know.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   It's very, very good.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.920]   Is it coarse than E or is it core?
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   Corpse with an E.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.920]   Corpse with an E.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.920]   For God's sake, don't put the album cover on the video.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.680]   But the point is the, what was my point?
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.040]   My point was lossless streaming is one thing, but I'm particularly excited about the prospect
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:34.880]   of high res because as part of some of these rumors that have been written about is that
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.160]   this may potentially support Dolby Atmos audio.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.560]   And that gets me very excited because what Apple's done with Atmos and with the spatial
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.040]   audio with the AirPods Pro is extremely effective.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.160]   It does create a very, very different movie-watching experience.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:59.680]   And a lot of live concerts and audio streams, music streams, they're recorded or mastered
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.200]   in 5.1 surround sound, for instance.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.440]   So the idea that maybe Apple, which does want to start doing much more with its music service,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:13.560]   it wants to do these live music experiences and even if it's documentaries or concert
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.320]   streams or whatever, I kind of see that all being part of the same thing.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:26.440]   And maybe this is Apple's step into not just lossless audio, but like stream.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.320]   But for live concerts and events and things like that.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.320]   It's sad.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.400]   Nothing Apple sells would qualify as high fidelity.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.400]   I mean, honestly.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.840]   Nothing Apple sells would qualify as high fidelity.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.960]   The AirPods are terrible.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:49.360]   They are terrible and well, they are terrible compared to if you buy a big nice set of headphones
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.320]   because Bluetooth compresses audio.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.080]   That's wireless is going to be good.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.240]   Even aptX.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:59.360]   But there are ways around that for sure.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.640]   And there's high-fi and Apple has its own chips in the earphones and maybe it can take
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   that a step further.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.160]   This is very iPhone.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:11.400]   This is what they did with the HomePod, which is they sell what is essentially kind of low
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.120]   end, you know, not certainly not high fidelity audio equipment.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.040]   But then they make a big deal about how they own 90 anechoic chambers and they hire the
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.040]   best engineers.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.360]   And this is, you know, and then they sell this thing for 300 bucks and nobody wanted.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.960]   They had to cancel it after a year.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.280]   I remember the iPod high-fi they were selling.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.920]   Steve Jobs said, I'm selling my high-end audio gear because this is so good.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.200]   And of course it died immediately too.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   This is very Apple.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   It is.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.160]   And I think the only way Apple is going to get something like this off the ground is if
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:48.000]   they do it in tandem with a premium set of AirPods, which lo and behold, it just so happens
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.480]   to have released a very expensive pair of headphones.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   So because people need to be able to put it on, on their head and really immediately tell
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.480]   that difference.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.120]   And with the spatial audio stuff, you really can.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.600]   But even someone who's ears aren't so good could probably notice the difference with.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.560]   So I've done a lot of work with high fidelity.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   This is interesting.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   I know that.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.840]   But so they're amazing.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:17.320]   And one of the problems that we're running into is the original AirPod.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.560]   You know, it will play that to you.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.000]   It's not capable of doing that spatial audio.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.640]   And even though they could update the algorithm that goes, you know, helps it connect from
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:35.360]   the AirPod to your iPhone or iPad or Mac, they won't do that.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:41.440]   I suspect they kind of want you to go and invest in the AirPod Pros or some new Apple
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.800]   product despite the wild popularity of AirPod.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:51.720]   They sell a $550 over the ear headphone, the AirPods Max, that even at that price, which
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.960]   is a steep price, is widely considered not to be particularly high fidelity.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   Right.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.080]   But my point here is you've got a startup.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.600]   This comes back to our previous discussion about monopoly, right?
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:11.400]   And so you've got a startup that's trying to compete with, you know, clubhouse and doing
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.560]   spatial audio for conferences.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.200]   You know, Zoom meetings, like a really a lot of interesting applications.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   There you go.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.120]   It's not about high fidelity music.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.120]   Right.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.400]   So high fidelity of the company.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.800]   So if they would come in and update that audio codec, it would help this space.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:36.000]   And you know, Apple in some ways is more interested in selling their higher resolution version
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   of the product.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.040]   See, I looked up high fidelity and unfortunately, I guess I found the high fidelity cannabis
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.040]   company.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:50.360]   So that's not what's this company, high fidelity, H-I-G-H?
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.960]   Yeah, high fidelity.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.560]   I feel like Rosedale, he's a second life guy.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   Fantastic.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.640]   Oh, see, okay.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:06.360]   So he's all because of Second Life, he's all about, you know, group things.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.000]   And you could see in Second Life, the ability to know, oh, that person's to my left, that
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.560]   person's behind me, that person's in front of me would be huge.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.960]   So he's selling a spatial audio API.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.080]   This is not the same, unfortunately, as Apple's technology.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.080]   So right.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.880]   But it's an underlying technology that is fundamentally destroyed by Apple's AirPods,
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   you know?
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.680]   He's like trying to talk to them, can we please update this code back?
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   Oh, sure.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   They'll work with him.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   No problem.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.040]   Yes, he is pretty important versus.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.400]   Phillip, if they invite you into the Apple headquarters to talk, do not go.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.320]   Or bring your lawyer anyway, that would be my advice.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.200]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.880]   So we're not talking because Apple, I think you could argue, has done more to ruin people's
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:43:00.960]   taste in music because of the kind of low-end headphones that were ubiquitous and the
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.680]   iPods.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.720]   They've just created, and 128 kilobits AC, they've created a generation of people who
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.480]   just don't know what good music sounds like.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   Now I really sound stupid.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   I sound like Neil Young or something.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.760]   But really, they become the low bar for audio feel like.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:25.440]   But on the other hand, spatial audio in a context like a concert or a meeting, it's
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.960]   not about the quality of the sound.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.520]   It's about the spatial experience.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.160]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.080]   And I can see Apple doubling down on that.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.520]   They do, unfortunately, I'm sorry, Phillip, own that.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.320]   At least my mind share of that.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.320]   Very interesting.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.760]   Is technology in any hardware yet?
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.800]   I probably should not answer that.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   Don't say anything.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.800]   Do not answer.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.040]   You've said enough, young Padawan.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.920]   So yeah, there is speculation that maybe Apple would announce something in June at
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.920]   WWDC.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.920]   They've had their event for this month.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.440]   One more story on air tags, and then we're going to take a break.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:16.840]   I thought a very good story on Mashable by a journalist who said, "You know, Apple says
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:23.200]   you can't use air tags to stalk people, but she gave her two roommates' air tags and
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.720]   was able to with no trouble at all and no alert to her friends."
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.960]   I mean, she told them ahead of time, but there was no other way they would have known.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.800]   Able to stalk them for days down to their exact location, their street address and so
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.000]   forth.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.360]   This is an interesting issue.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.480]   The National Network to End Domestic Violence says, "Apple's got to fix this."
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.480]   This has been a problem with Bluetooth trackers from day one, but the tracker network, the
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.920]   town network, were always so scant that it really didn't, there was no way to track anybody
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.920]   with this.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.280]   All of a sudden, you've got a GPS, better than a GPS device, that you could slip into
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.520]   somebody's purse or pocket or follow them around.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:11.040]   Now, didn't Apple say there was something built into the system that would alert you
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:16.720]   if you were within close proximity to the same air tag that wasn't registered to you?
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.720]   Yes.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.280]   To find my network, I think it's essentially...
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:29.800]   Every iPhone, every iPad is similar, is a little beacon for these things.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.680]   You don't need Wi-Fi necessarily, but if it detects one that isn't registered to you,
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.680]   then it can say, "Hey, look, there's an actual...
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.320]   In theory, this is the press release.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:45.760]   So credit to Brenda Stoliar at Mashable, who actually tested this, and found that a
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:55.800]   lot of the protections Apple puts in are not effective to prevent stalking.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:07.760]   For instance, they say that if once the air tag is separated from you, it will, after
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:13.000]   some period of time, start beeping.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   You'll get a safety alert.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.400]   Now, first of all, if you have an iPhone with 14...
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.560]   5, you're a little bit safer.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.720]   You'll get a safety alert that says your current location can be seen by the owner of
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   this air tag.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.640]   Her roommate said, "Andrade phones."
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.680]   So they saw nothing.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:34.160]   It takes about three days, she said, before the air tag starts beeping at you saying,
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.320]   "There's an air tag in your purse.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.640]   Three days is plenty of time for a stalker to do his dirty work."
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.520]   I think that's only three days if it doesn't reconnect to the original device in that time.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   Right.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.760]   So if you're coming home at the end of every day, if someone's tracking their spouse unwillingly,
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.680]   then ultimately, that child may never even go off.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:47:00.320]   But let's say, okay, let's say I'm a stalker and I've decided that Britney Spears is the
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.840]   target of my affection.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.840]   And I can somehow get this slipped into her purse.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   She's not going to my house.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.560]   She's going to her house.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.760]   It will be three days before the air tag starts beeping.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:15.640]   If she does not have an iPhone with 14 of 5 on it, she'll have no idea it's there.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.000]   This is a good article to read.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.040]   She was able to use the air tag to track her roommates down to the address.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.920]   Her roommates thought I was kind of creepy.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.720]   She would text them and say, "Are you at 118 McDougall Street?"
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.880]   And they'd say, "That's creepy."
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.240]   You know what?
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.440]   Are you at jeans right now?
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.120]   Oh my God, stalker.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.120]   I thought this was...
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.320]   I mean, it's not scientific, but Apple has not been clear about what the period of time
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:43.160]   is, for instance, before it starts beeping.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:48.640]   In theory, if you go to a regularly visited place, your home would be the primary one,
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.040]   but like your work, the air tag will disable.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.360]   But that's only, again, if you have iOS 14 5 on a late model iPhone.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.120]   And so, yeah, don't use this to stalk anybody who has a late model iPhone, I guess, and
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.640]   keeps it up to date.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.640]   But there's still...
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.560]   There's some real issues with this, I think.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:16.080]   So I don't want to say to Apple fan girl, but I'm going to defend them just a little
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.080]   bit here.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:25.640]   I think my interpretation of this is it's always different when you have something tested internally
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:31.360]   at Apple versus releasing it to the mass public and seeing how they handle this.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.400]   To me, the real question isn't, "Does this work today?"
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:43.880]   It's, "Is it Apple interested in creating an architecture that will help minimize this
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.840]   obvious problem?"
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.600]   And I think that answer is yes.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:54.000]   So the things we're talking about here can all be updated for future update to air tags
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   into iOS.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I think that's very...
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   I think that's very...
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   I think that's very...
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   They can fix this.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.760]   I also think it's just worth saying, "We can master blast Apple for this and it's fair."
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.680]   But if you want to talk about real stalkerware, I urge you to look at some of the infosec
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:14.880]   dangers that are possible in Android in regards to stalking.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:22.160]   We're talking listening to everything you do, recording every single site you visit, broadcasting
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:27.640]   your location, and this by rooting the phone very, very easily.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.720]   Their company is specialized in this.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   So I'm not saying the danger isn't there.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:37.520]   I'm saying I personally have faith that Apple is going to address it.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.480]   Maybe you're more cynical than I am, but that's my take.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.200]   You know, I'm sure they will, but only if they get pressure.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   So we're giving them pressure.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.360]   Thank God for turning this on.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.120]   Apple clearly thought about it.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.240]   They were aware of this.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.720]   They even mentioned in the event and in their press releases, "Here's what we're doing
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.280]   to prevent this been used by stalkers."
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.240]   It's just important that people raise this issue, and I think this article in Mashable
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.480]   by Brenda Stolier is very good at raising some real critical issues.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.000]   People should be aware of this.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.440]   I guess one solution is for everybody to buy an iPhone.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.840]   Apple wouldn't mind that solution.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.760]   Another solution might be for Apple to make some changes to how this works.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:26.040]   Would it be possible for a tag to be disabled by another person's iOS device?
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:31.840]   So you can actually disable it even with an Android device if you find it.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:37.000]   So it has NFC in it, and you can scan it, and it'll say, "This tracker belongs to this
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.920]   person, and you can disable it at that point."
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.680]   But you have to find it.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.560]   I mean, Brandon, that makes an excellent point.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   I mean, every smartphone is potentially the worst tracker in the world.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:55.120]   It has a microphone camera and GPS, and there are ways to make any smartphone be dangerous
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.120]   to you.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.200]   So this is a general-
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.400]   But the battery in a phone, the battery in a phone would die after a couple of days
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.520]   if you're running GPS and everything on it.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.520]   Right.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.240]   The battery in an air tag, I think, can last about a year.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:13.880]   I think it could be problematic much as I don't want it to be, and I hope it isn't.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.680]   It's something to be aware of.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   That's all I...
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.640]   And I think Apple needs to respond to these...
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.040]   I think reasonable criticisms.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:23.000]   Somebody, by the way, is pointing out...
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.120]   Somebody in the RRC says, "You know, you can't disable it.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:30.880]   You hit it with a hammer, or you can actually remove the battery.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.000]   So if you can find it, you can disable it.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.760]   That's not hard to do."
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.760]   Go ahead, Tim.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.760]   Sorry.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.960]   I was just going to say, "This reminds me a bit of the release of Google Glass, actually,
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:42.080]   where Google decided for a cool tech product."
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.120]   And it seemed like they really didn't put any thought into the whole privacy aspect
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.120]   of the thing.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.480]   They threw it out there to see what consumers would do with it.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.720]   And everybody said, "Oh my God, this is terrifying.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.640]   You're going to be recording me in the bathroom and things like that."
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:57.160]   And Google, at the time, was very reluctant to make any changes to Google Glass, to make
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.600]   any privacy advocate feel even a little bit better about other people wearing this thing.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.880]   Ultimately, it wasn't a mass market product, and it really never went anywhere.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:08.920]   Apple, I hope they respond in a better way that they're more receptive to these things.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.240]   And I think they will, too, because they obviously want to sell a lot of these things.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.240]   Yeah, and they will.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.760]   I mean, this is going to be, and Tiles right to be terrified.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.800]   You can't compete with a billion iPhones, and this is going to be ubiquitous.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.040]   I ordered four.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.560]   People are starting to get them already.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.560]   Me too.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.560]   And the thing that--
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:27.560]   They're a product.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:33.960]   It is, and the thing that it does that nothing else does is this UWB, this ability with the
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:40.640]   ultra wideband chip built into late model iPhones, point your iPhone and get-- it's under the
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.480]   couch, pointed at it, and then there it is.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.920]   That's-- nobody can do that, and that's fantastic.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.080]   I mean, eventually, I suppose, UWB isn't owned by Apple.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.880]   I suppose other companies can do this.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.480]   But this is why you live in that ecosystem, Brianna, because it works.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:02.280]   I do have to say, one of the problems I think Tyle made-- this is just my experience with
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.640]   it, but the first versions of it did not have a user replaceable battery.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   That was shame.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   I will never forget.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.200]   What's the site with the funny illustrations that you go to?
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   XKCD here.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.640]   No, no, no, no, the one-- how to, how to wiki.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   How to.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   And you're going there before--
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.840]   I like how you remember the how to wiki.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:28.640]   But you know, it's showing you how to like provide these things apart to replace the battery
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.240]   in it, because they want to sell you an earth destroying thing.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.240]   Every year.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.520]   And I'm like, F this.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:42.200]   You know, if Tyle had not made such user hostile decisions at the beginning, I think
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.760]   they would have more market share today and would be in a more aggressive position with
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   Apple.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.200]   Yeah, they have replaceable batteries now, but I think the perception that you throw away
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.960]   the tile when it runs out of juice is still with a lot of people.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:01.000]   I mean, maybe they made some steps wrong, but boy, I don't think anybody ever wants to
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.240]   compete with Apple.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.960]   That's just a bad place to be, you know?
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   Maybe Google will.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   In fact, it's interesting.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.520]   Google I/O is coming up in a couple of weeks, May 18th.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.760]   Sundar Pachay and we'll talk about Google in the next segment, but Sundar Pachay, but
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:20.800]   it's a little tease, Sundar Pachay in the quarterly analyst's call, basically said,
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.960]   "Yeah, we kind of took it easy last year."
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.320]   And the cadence product cadence is going to step up and we're going to have something
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:33.200]   very big to announce at Google I/O.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.760]   And I wonder if they're going to move the Pixel 6 announcement up.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.560]   Normally, they do that in the fall.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:43.800]   We know that Google is going to design its own chips this time.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.280]   And so the Pixel, which really, the Pixel 5 was kind of like, "Ah, ahh."
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:53.240]   In fact, so much so that I stuck with my Pixel 4 and you know me, I always get the whatever
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.440]   the latest is.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.680]   I think this could be very interesting and that's only a couple of weeks off.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.320]   So I want to see a vital, engaged Google.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.640]   I don't like the Google of 2020, the sleepy Google.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.880]   That wasn't good.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:15.960]   We will talk about Google's quarterly results and Amazon's profits and a whole lot more,
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:20.840]   including a Google privacy robot in their offices.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:24.920]   But first to word, as long as we're talking about privacy from ExpressVPN, have you ever
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.840]   browsed in incognito mode?
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.600]   It's not as incognito as you might think.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:35.360]   In fact, there's a $5 billion class action lawsuit against the company right now because
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.520]   a user said, "You know, I went in incognito mode.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.840]   Little did I know Google's still collecting user data."
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.720]   Google's made its fortune by tracking your movements online.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.840]   Google says, "Well incognito doesn't mean invisible."
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.760]   And they do have an announcement, I guess, when you go in there.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:56.000]   But really, you should know that even if you're using private browsing in Safari or any of
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.680]   these so-called incognito modes, your ISP can still see everywhere you go when you search
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   on Google.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.720]   Google knows you're there.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.960]   How do you actually make yourself invisible as possible online?
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.960]   ExpressVPN.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.200]   That's our sponsor for this segment.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.480]   We're big fans.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.640]   Even in incognito mode, your online activity gets tracked.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.880]   Data brokers still got by and sell your information.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.200]   Data harvesters can use your IP address to uniquely identify you in your location.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.720]   With ExpressVPN, your connection gets rerouted through an encrypted server.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.480]   Your IP address is masked.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:36.000]   You're given a random IP address that is shared by many, many other ExpressVPN customers.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.360]   So it's a lot harder for third parties to identify you and harvest your data.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.840]   The best part is how easy it is to use ExpressVPN no matter what device you're using, phone,
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.280]   laptop or smart TV.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.080]   The button gives you protection.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.960]   Sometimes I'll turn it on and forget, leave it on for weeks.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.480]   Finally go, "Oh, but why not leave it on if it's that fast?"
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:02.560]   So if you really want to go incognito and protect your privacy and secure yourself with
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:08.360]   the number one rated VPN, visit expressvpn.com/twit.

[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:37.960]   Thank you, ExpressVPN, for your support.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.480]   This has been a week to remember on Twit.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.160]   We've made a little video.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.440]   This won't win an Oscar, but it should win something.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.440]   Watch.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:54.040]   I'm going to explain that due to COVID requirements, I'm recording this by myself with an Insta360
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.480]   360 degree camera.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:01.640]   Previously on Twit, hands on tech.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.320]   Finally, my Mustang Mach-E has arrived.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:08.920]   Yes, it's not quite a Mustang, but it has some Mustang touches and it sure is fun to
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.440]   drive.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.440]   Tech News Weekly.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:20.680]   Researchers are taking time to look into and ponder the possible effects of deep fate.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.480]   Geography, for example, creating hysteria around things like wildfires.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   There you go.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.440]   We're not exists.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.600]   This week in Google.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.960]   This is not moral panic.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.920]   This is really a scary story from The Washer bust.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.200]   She never returned her VHS copy of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.600]   What the fuck is this story?
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   The DA's office.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.160]   This happened to me.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:47.240]   20 years later, she faces a felony charge.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.080]   IOS today.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   I have air tags.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.400]   Look, it says air tag on there right there.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.920]   Open up one of these air tags and it just pops up on my phone.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   OK, this is great.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.320]   I wish she'd get it so fast.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.160]   Now I'm also available in several colors of unapologetic plastic.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:05.080]   I wish I had those air tags.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.160]   Apple did the usual thing.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.120]   They sent me the holders.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.360]   I got all excited.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.360]   Nothing from Apple.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.360]   My air tags are here.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.360]   No, no.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.480]   They'll come soon.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.480]   Let's see.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   What else is news?
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:22.160]   Google earnings, smash sales records.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.960]   This is going to be a broken record if we go through all the companies that tech companies
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.840]   have released their earnings.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.680]   YouTube, very, very successful.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.320]   Alphabet's total profit, $18 billion.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.400]   Nice to make a billion and a half dollars a week.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.000]   Nice work if you can get it.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.240]   But here's the most important number.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:45.600]   That's up 162% from the previous year.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:51.920]   162%-- wow.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.520]   Google's going to also repurchase shares.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.760]   Apple said $90 billion.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.360]   Google only going to repurchase $50 billion in shares.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.440]   That makes stock owners happy because their shares are worth more.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:12.640]   The company had 31.88 billions in sales, 30% increase.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:17.280]   YouTube, $6 billion in revenue, 49% increase.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.800]   Yeah, because we were all home with nothing to do and we'd saw all the Netflix shows.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.800]   So why not?
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.800]   A little YouTube.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.280]   I mean, every single Sunday I'm dreading that pop-up that comes up with what my screen
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.280]   time is.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   YouTube is like, I know it's embarrassing.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.720]   What do you watch on YouTube?
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.520]   I watch a car repair videos.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.800]   Obviously, a lot of Twitch.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.160]   You got to watch that.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.600]   Mostly car stuff and video game stuff.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.920]   I did want to say, though, every time we talk about stock buybacks, this used to be illegal
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.480]   a while back because it's essentially a sugar-eye for your stock price.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.240]   I don't know how I feel about that being such a common practice these days.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.640]   Part of why I think workers don't get the money when companies do very well is they
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.800]   tend to just put it straight back into stock buybacks.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800]   Well, what else are you going to do?
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.880]   I mean, this is one of the problems you have when you have, I don't know how many billions
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.200]   in cash Apple has or Google.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.800]   Apple was well over $200 billion in cash.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.560]   There's not a lot you can do.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.400]   Stock buybacks are probably the most...
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.880]   They don't help the economy.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.120]   They don't hire more people.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.320]   They don't build more products.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.200]   They don't build plants.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.480]   They really only help shareholders and employees.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.320]   Maybe that's what you're saying is it be nice if they put some cloud, some of that into
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.360]   something that would help the economy.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.480]   The people that helped make all that money.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.200]   I don't know.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:57.080]   I saw a story a while back that Apple could go with and not sell a single product and
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   put...
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.920]   Excuse me, I'm the same amount that they're doing today on R&D and they would have enough
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.800]   cash on hand to go for like 60 years or something.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.760]   So there it is.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.760]   Maybe this will make you feel better.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:14.360]   I don't want to go back to Apple, but they have committed to $430 billion in US investments
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:20.920]   over the next five years including a new North Carolina campus job.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   This is from the Apple press release job creating investments in innovative fields like Silicon
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.640]   Engineering and 5G technology.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.800]   Apple's desperately trying to find the next big hit.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.040]   iPhone is huge.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:38.280]   Everybody agrees that Apple's looking closely at augmented reality spectacles.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.560]   So I bet a lot of that is in that area.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.280]   Don't forget the Apple car.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.320]   Do you think Tim really an Apple car?
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.560]   I'm still incredibly skeptical, but all signs are pointing that they really, really, really
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   want to make some money in there.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.560]   They're hiring people.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.240]   There was an Apple TV thing, the actual Apple television thing where again, all the signs
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.400]   are pointing to they're going to do it and then ultimately they scrapped it last minute.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.880]   It seems like they're just so much more motivated to make this happen one way or another.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.240]   So yeah, I think we're going to see something.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.680]   I still don't know exactly what it's going to be or if they're going to actually try to
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.480]   manufacture a car or partner with somebody like Magda to make it happen.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.600]   But for sure it's going to take a lot of money and make it happen.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.040]   And if you're going to do it, North Carolina would be a pretty good place to do it while
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.040]   that engineering.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.960]   There's a lot of amazing engineering talent in the motorsport space around there.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.440]   It's a nice way.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.840]   I was wondering why North Carolina for a second headquarters, that seems an odd place.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.760]   I mean, there's a lot of talent in that area.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.360]   They know they can get that Foxconn factory for nothing if they want.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.160]   So that's in Wisconsin.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.640]   Sorry, that's in Wisconsin.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.160]   Actually in response to the chip shortage, I think you're seeing some big commitments
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.160]   from a lot of companies, including TSMC, the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company,
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.920]   which makes all of Apple's chips, they're going to spend tens of billions of dollars
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.880]   on chip fabs in Arizona.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.160]   Intel has announced they're going to do the same thing.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.800]   A lot of response to the chip shortage, but the problem is it takes years to put these
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.800]   online.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.080]   And those chip shortages.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:17.560]   I just, Samable Samadar, our car guy, just told me Tim that Ford's saying now they're
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.160]   only going to be able to make half as many cars as the demand this year.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.040]   Yeah, it's really amazing.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:30.000]   So many manufacturers have spent so much time over the past five years putting chips
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.120]   into everything from suspension to, of course, infotainment and smart climate control.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.640]   And so, you know, a lot of that stuff was not very well integrated.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.680]   So your average car has, you know, half a dozen or more different bits of silicon in
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.680]   there.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.800]   And so if any of those is affected by the numerous shortages going on around the world
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.560]   right now, then suddenly you have a big problem.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560]   And Ford definitely does.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.960]   And just about every manufacturer on the planet right now does too.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.760]   So it's, you know, like you said, there's no easy solution here because it does take
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.080]   so long to spin up a new fab.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.760]   A lot of companies are now making investments and doing their own chip research, just like
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.240]   Apple, of course.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.160]   But again, it's going to take years before anybody can really make any massive headway
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.160]   on that front.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.160]   So we can be seeing the ramifications going for quite a long time on this, which is one
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.920]   of the reasons why we're seeing used car sales, you know, go through the roof and use car
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.680]   valuations are going through the roof right now, not quite as much as, you know, dogecoin.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.240]   But for sure, I have a lot of friends who bought a car two years ago who are going on
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.400]   to pick any random online use car market and getting cash offers for more than they bought
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   their car.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   Which is astronomical.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:40.120]   It makes sense if there's a shortage of new cars by I bet I get some money from my
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.480]   Mustang Mach-E.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.640]   How much you give me?
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.640]   How much you give me, Brianna?
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.640]   I'm good.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   You don't do the electric.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.640]   I will.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.200]   I have say, I love it.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.760]   Porsche puts it out.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.920]   Well, the Ticon.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.520]   The Ticon, everybody who has a Ticon loves it.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.520]   Yeah, it's an amazing car.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.840]   It's just too big for me.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:07.040]   You know, my cars are 9-11, 86, 9-11, 2000 Boxster in 2018 came in.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.160]   I like small, fast cars.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.400]   Is the Ticon that much bigger?
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400]   I didn't realize.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.400]   Oh, it's a big car.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.400]   It's because of the battery.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.400]   It's just class size, pretty much.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.440]   Oh, but their next car will be like an AV version of the Macon, which is a smaller crossover
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.440]   SUV.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.440]   So they're going to go smaller.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.920]   But it's going to be a while before we see a proper EV sports car, unfortunately.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   Yeah, I know.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.080]   I'll keep waiting, though.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.080]   Yeah, me too.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.080]   I think we're good.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.640]   But this comes back to Apple, though.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:38.520]   Like, you know, if you think about Apple being in your cars, it is our infotainment system.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:44.120]   Like in a Porsche, you know, Porsche's fundamental software for the car just sucks.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.960]   Everybody just uses Apple CarPlay.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.960]   I think that's true.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.960]   Yeah, that's what I...
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.920]   Well, the one thing wrong with Tesla is they refuse to use CarPlay or Android Auto.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.760]   They do their own stuff.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:59.120]   So Apple has spent so much effort on their battery technology.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:05.240]   If Apple could solve batteries or, you know, increase range or increase lightness or,
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:10.680]   you know, do that, like, they would have a real opportunity to do things like that for
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   cars.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.920]   Like, imagine your battery tech, like, being marketed as an Apple product or the software
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.920]   inside of it.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.320]   I could see Apple moving into that space.
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:24.840]   But if you're talking of, like, the liability that they would have for a self-driving system,
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.240]   I mean, Apple doesn't want to be the brand that kills grandma in the next...
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.200]   That would not look good.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.680]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.440]   I mentioned the YouTube growth.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.760]   What I forgot to mention is that YouTube is actually growing at a faster rate than Netflix
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.560]   twice the growth rate of Netflix.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.560]   So stand back.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:52.400]   To compare those two, because their business models are the same from a consumer standpoint,
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.280]   but also wildly different from how they make the sausage perspective.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.440]   You know, YouTube kind of just sits back and lets all the content roll in.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.520]   Well, certainly they do have first party productions, but by and large, it's his letter
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.280]   of what else to shovel the coal and the furnace for them.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.960]   Whereas Netflix is going out and investing millions of dollars into original productions
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.840]   around the world, which sounds so much harder than what YouTube has to do.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.840]   But yet they're making...
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.360]   Pretty soon they'll be making the same amount of revenue.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.760]   That too means pretty fast, right?
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.760]   Absolutely.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.880]   Netflix is going to spend $17 billion to make new content.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.560]   That's the driver for Netflix's success.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.680]   YouTube just says, "Hey, y'all, make some videos, and we'll figure out which ones are
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.240]   the best with our algorithm, and then we'll put some ads on them."
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.760]   Cool.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.760]   That is modern.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.760]   That's what TikTok's doing.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.560]   That's the modern way of doing things.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.600]   Netflix is the old Hollywood model, which is you throw a lot of money in production,
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.200]   you make money in a handful of successes.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:53.440]   I think Quibi proved that was not the way to do it in the digital era.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.720]   YouTube is clearly the way to do it going forward.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.520]   Can I ask a question?
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   What is...
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.880]   Do we know what the current revenue split is for YouTube?
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.320]   Because it was 50/50, I believe, at one point.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.720]   Is it still 50/50 for content creators?
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.000]   Does YouTube reveal that?
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   I don't even know.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.320]   How did you find that out, Nate?
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.040]   Do you have a secret insider?
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.040]   I've...
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040]   Interesting.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   Not to my knowledge, unless it came in somewhere like this.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.280]   Every creator I talk to says, "Uh..."
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.520]   Because YouTube isn't telling them.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.480]   They're not saying, "Yeah, we sold the ad for $50, and we're going to give you $25."
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.480]   They don't say that.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.760]   They just say, "Here's $25 bucks, and joy a kid."
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.440]   Thank you very much.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.160]   So I don't know if it's 50/50.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.160]   It's certainly...
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.440]   Look, if it's 50/50, that's a lot more than a 30% take that Apple takes out of the App
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   store.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440]   50%.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440]   One of my knowledge is so bad.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   It's just so bad.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.440]   Do we know?
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   Same by no?
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.200]   I think you do get a pretty good insight into what exactly it is, but I can say the rates
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.400]   are very low compared to what we can get in-house through our own distribution.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.200]   Oh, yeah, you might know for your videos.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.200]   Yes.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.200]   So, yeah, for sure.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.720]   I don't know if I can or should, but we certainly do have a pretty good insight.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.960]   Yeah, I'd say it does make Apple look pretty generous and so forth.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.960]   Here's Jason.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:10.960]   Jason.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.960]   Jason.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:16.320]   I'm here with you, and this is what they say.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.840]   There's a 45/55 split for all content creators.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.560]   Google keeps 45% and you get the remaining 55%.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.520]   Let me see though where they get that information because I feel like Google isn't a little
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520]   cagey.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.960]   If you are a major content producer, they have partnerships and things like that.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.920]   And it is possible to integrate ad sales as well so you could bring basically kind of
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.720]   your own pre-roll in some situations as well.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.960]   We would change as a math to some degree as well.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:52.240]   But for sure, it is, you have to be generating a lot of use to kind of make up for the overhead.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.240]   So there that, you know, if Apple wants to defend, it's 30%.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.080]   All they have to do is say, well, look what Microsoft, Sony charges in their stores.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:08.040]   Look what YouTube charges in effect by taking 45% of the ads, 30%.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.720]   That's not so bad.
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.720]   What about Twitch?
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.680]   Do you have a similar ratio?
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.880]   I'm sure it's pretty competitive, right?
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.440]   It's got to be, right?
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.520]   Because if you're a creator, you're going to choose where you can make the most money.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.520]   Think about Twitch.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.040]   There's also a lot of money in Twitch just from, you know, gifts from the, from your
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040]   viewers, right?
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.280]   That's a big part of it, not even ads.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.280]   Exactly.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.800]   Is that how you make a living young lady?
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.400]   You sell your videos.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.240]   I've thought about doing speedruns on Twitch.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   Yeah, I was going to say all the speedruns you should.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.840]   They're too short though.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.840]   Yeah, sure.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840]   You need long speedruns.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.320]   It takes hundreds of hours.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:53.120]   My resident evil three save is up to like 300 hours.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.120]   Wow.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   But that's not a speedrun.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.880]   But you have to play it over and over to get good, Leo.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.880]   You're just walking and you're like, I am the God.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.040]   Do you feel like though, is it a little grindy for those 300 hours?
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.240]   Like I got a really work hard at this.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   This isn't fun anymore.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.160]   Do you know what it is?
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.840]   I've noticed it with a lot of other speedrunners.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.240]   We love EDM and we love music and I think there's something about repetition of it.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.240]   Oh, I get it.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.000]   But it's the same part of your brain that likes at EDM in that pattern.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.040]   It's like you get into this groove and it's soothing, but it's intense at the same time.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.160]   That's my theory at least.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.160]   That's interesting.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.160]   What's your fastest?
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.480]   Is it Super Mario?
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.400]   Mario is my best world record.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.000]   I got to tell you, I'm doing pretty well at Resident Evil.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.440]   I'm cracking down on that one.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.880]   Wait, let me see if I can, here we go.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880]   It's not a video.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   It's just a picture.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880]   No.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   That's just it.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880]   Yeah, I want to see it.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.400]   Fun fact, I'm pretty great at speedrunning Super Mario 2.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.400]   I can beat the game.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.400]   Now this is what a speedrun is.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.920]   Oh, that's old.
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:02.920]   That's an old record.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.120]   I'm way quicker than that.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.520]   You're way faster than that.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.120]   Oh, this is ancient history.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.520]   This is all last year.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.120]   You had all of pandemic to get good.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.040]   How funny.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.040]   I was trying to save the country for most of the pandemic.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.280]   Thank you very much.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.160]   Give us a plug for Rebellion Pack.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.160]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.320]   What is Rebellion Pack?
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.600]   You couldn't talk about it when you founded it, but you can talk about it now, right?
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.600]   That's true.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.520]   Basically, we are working to get the right people elected.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.080]   Right now we're focused on helping Democrats keep the House and the Senate.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.280]   We worked our butts off in Georgia, helping Warnock and Ossoff win.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.880]   So if you want to support us, you can do that at helptherebellion.com.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.640]   I'm going to play this underneath your plug.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.840]   That's it.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.840]   Oh, this is so old.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.840]   Look, no, there are--
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.240]   Well, I just got to go with what's on YouTube, man.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.720]   It's just what's on YouTube.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.720]   You fasted it.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720]   This is a trash run.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.720]   Look at this.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:01.720]   No.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.320]   Oh, this is garbage.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.720]   This is that February run.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.800]   You got something newer for me?
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.960]   You only have 24 subscribers on your YouTube channel.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.560]   You got to start putting newer stuff up.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.520]   I put my real stuff on Vimeo.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.520]   That's the reason why.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520]   Really?
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.720]   Okay, you didn't bring that up in our conversation.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.520]   Why do you do that?
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:25.200]   Vimeo, it lets for longer games, it lets you dump vast amounts of videos.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.720]   So for a run like Resident Evil 3, which is a 53-minute run, it's just friendlier with
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.720]   that.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:32.720]   So here I'll--
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.520]   It takes you 53 minutes.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.520]   That's fast.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:39.720]   Who play through the entire Resident Evil 3.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.720]   Yeah, hold on.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.720]   I'll drop it in.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.720]   I'll drop it in club twit.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.720]   Oh, man.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.160]   I want to see this.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.160]   Is it scary?
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.960]   Is that a scary-- sounds like a scary game.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.920]   Yeah, of course it's scary.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.920]   It's a little weird.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.400]   It sounds scary.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.640]   I don't know.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:03.000]   All right, while you're doing that, let me tell you all about Zipper Cruder speaking
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.520]   a speedy-- Zipper Cruder really speeds up your hiring.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520]   Get it?
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520]   Get it?
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.520]   I'm talking about a good segue there.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:13.880]   Finding somebody in your company, somebody to wear many hats or one very specific hat
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.000]   is no easy task.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.720]   But if you're hiring these days, thank you.

[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.440]   It's hard or you can-- you have a simple position but it's taken forever to find somebody who
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.720]   fits your company culture.

[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.920]   They don't call you.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.480]   They don't email you.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.120]   All of the applications go into your Zipper Cruder interface.

[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.800]   We know here, ladies and gentlemen, is Brianna Wu.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:37.080]   I won't play all 54 minutes in one second of your speed run.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.760]   Now do you run, what level do you do this at the hard mode?
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:40.760]   How do you do this?
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.360]   No, you do it the easiest because then everyone has the least health possible.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.720]   So skip like a couple of minutes in so you can just get the mad movement as you're going
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720]   through.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.720]   It's the first person shooter.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.720]   There you are with a bazooka.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.800]   Oh shoot, Vimeo's buffer.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   Here we go.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.160]   You're running, is this a good place?
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.440]   This is, you ready the rocket launcher as you go downstairs because it saves you a couple
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440]   of frames.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.080]   Oh yeah, it's things like that, isn't it?
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.040]   It's the little things.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.200]   It's much like ice racing.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.640]   So you have to be very careful.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.120]   Yeah, I always have my rocket launcher.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.120]   You have the rocket launcher.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   Okay, no.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.120]   And my turtle shield shield.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.600]   How do you know who to shoot?
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.600]   You roll through it.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.100]   Oh, error.
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.680]   You shoot all the zombies, right?
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.720]   No, you don't want to shoot them because that takes time.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.720]   Ah!
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.560]   Your goal is to get to all of the points, but not necessarily.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.720]   What are you trying to hit every locale?
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.680]   You're trying to get from start to finish as quickly as possible.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.680]   So killing zombies is really a side track.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.240]   Watch how fast you do this puzzle.
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.240]   This is ridiculous.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.880]   You have to memorize everything like this through the whole game.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.560]   I only have enough time through this radio conversation to enter all of this in.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.400]   Is this always the same?
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.400]   Wow.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.400]   Did it?
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.400]   Oh, subway.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.400]   Look at you.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.400]   You go, girl.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.880]   Do you have to do is it the same every time or?
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.720]   So you're basically memorizing the steps.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:04.720]   Yes.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:05.720]   Yes.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.880]   Quick turn out the stairs.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.080]   I like it that this character looks like you.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.160]   I think that's hysterical.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.920]   Is that just a chance?
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:13.920]   I would have enough like Jill.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.920]   No, I love Jill.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.920]   She's an icon.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920]   Jill's iconic.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.160]   Can we stop for donuts?
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.160]   Do we have time?
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.160]   No donuts.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.160]   Oh, man.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.160]   Oh, you.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.160]   Ah!
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:29.680]   If you get hit for this part, it puts you in a health state where you actually run faster.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.120]   So I'm going to come for you.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.240]   So you wanted to get bit.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240]   Right.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.240]   So you do that.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.240]   You run for Nemesis.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.240]   Oh, my God.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.440]   And now I'm going to go up and avoid all these people.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   It's great, great.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.600]   And I thought it was crazy digging a troll trench.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.600]   This is great, Greg.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.280]   Do you stay up late doing this?
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.880]   Yeah, I love this game.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880]   This is great.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.000]   Lisa says, you can only play your game after I go to bed.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   Oh!
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   Ew!
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   Ew!
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   Ew!
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.720]   So it's like EDM you're saying.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.640]   It's just like soothing, like you're calm.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:07.560]   And this is not, you're not like nervous or it's like, I'm just doing it.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.760]   You're scared you're going to mess your run up, right?
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:10.760]   Right.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.760]   But you know what's coming next.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.760]   So you don't.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.760]   Yeah, you know what's going to happen.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.160]   Like it's not scary.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.160]   Wow.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:23.840]   Do you ever think, gosh, if I put this much effort into my real life, I don't know what.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.840]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.520]   There have been times I've been like, I should stop speedrunning and do something else.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.800]   No, never stop speedrunning, Brianna.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.800]   I should mention, you mentioned, you posted this in the Discord.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.560]   We do have a Discord now, but it's for Club Twitch members.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560]   Sorry.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.600]   Club Twitch is our new paid tier for Twitch.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:48.440]   Now let me tell you, the whole point of Club Twitch is the ad free versions.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.680]   All of our shows, we have people were saying, "Leo, why don't you have ad free versions?"
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:59.600]   All of our shows are ad free on Club Twitch, including this ad that you're hearing right
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.600]   now.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.480]   There'll be no ad for Club Twitch in your ad free feed.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.320]   I realized why should I advertise?
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.320]   You're already a member.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.880]   So you get all the shows ad free.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.880]   That's audio and video versions.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.240]   And you get a special feed dedicated to you.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:15.640]   You get access to a special feed called Twitch Plus, which is kind of the stuff that normally
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.560]   hits the cutting room floor, beginning and ending of shows, special events.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.840]   How did Poker Night go, Anthony?
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.080]   Was that fun on Friday night?
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.680]   They had a Poker Night.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:28.520]   We're doing a Linux show in the Discord every Saturday afternoon, things like that.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.800]   And then of course, there's this fabulous Discord, which frankly, we thought the ad free
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.840]   version of the shows would be the selling point.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.160]   But the Discord is this great community.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.600]   We're having so much fun in here.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.520]   All the shows have a chat section.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:49.160]   There's also conversations about cars, books, coding, comics, data science, hacking hardware,
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.960]   IoT and on and on.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:55.240]   We just added food and travel because I realized we didn't have food and travel.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.240]   You could play games.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.080]   We have a trivia game in here, chess game.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.280]   But what's really good about this is the community.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.200]   There's some really great people in here.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.720]   We also do live streams of our shows in the club to it.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.280]   And I'm doing this on a stage.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.880]   It looks a lot like Clubhouse.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.560]   If you want to speak in one of our shows, you can raise your hand and we get people on
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.640]   many of our shows via audio.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.840]   So it's a lot of fun.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.840]   All of that.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840]   All of that.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.240]   You pay seven bucks a month.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   That's all.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:27.760]   Just the cost of a frappuccino.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.560]   Seven bucks a month.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560]   Club to it.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.600]   If you want to know more, there's no trial version.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.040]   But you can try it for a month.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.360]   It's month to month you can cancel.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:39.640]   Is that Club, Twit.tv/club.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.840]   Twit.tv/club.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   Twit.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:47.800]   It's really, it turns out that I've always loved the Twit community and having one more
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:48.800]   place we can gather.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.120]   Still do all the free stuff, by the way.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.240]   This didn't change any of the free tier.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.400]   We still offer all the shows as we always have ad supported.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.120]   We still have the Twit.community forums.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.200]   The Twit.socialmastedon.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.840]   We still have the IRC at IRC.Twit.tv.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.520]   That's all free.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.200]   And it's going to stay that way.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.760]   Thanks to ad support and of course Club Twit.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:17.640]   And my speed running, my Valheim speed running, which is going to be really, really great.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.440]   Google's plan for the future of work.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.440]   Did you?
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.840]   This, by the way.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.320]   This is a New York Times, Sunday Times story, but you shouldn't read it in the paper because
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.600]   the article online has all these hysterical, I guess they're animated, gifts.
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:37.600]   So Google knows people are coming back, but they're redesigning how their campuses are
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.960]   going to work.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.120]   Keep showing this because there's some fun stuff in different ways.
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:51.080]   For instance, when you go back, you might be in a new team pod where your team gets together
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.640]   in a blank canvas.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.880]   There are chairs, desks, whiteboards, and storage units, but everything's on casters.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.960]   So you arrange it as you wish.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.040]   There are also these meeting room concepts.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.080]   Here's one called Campfire.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.240]   Camera in the middle.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.840]   Some employees are still remote.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.000]   So they're on avatars, kind of like we do Twit.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   Some people are in Stu.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   We should do Twit like this.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   This looks cool.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.400]   We could all sit around and apply wood chairs.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.120]   Then they've also built on the Google campus because it's in Northern California where
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.840]   the weather's nice pretty much year round.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.600]   They've built basically nature retreats.
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.640]   They took over a couple of parking lots.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:38.240]   Each tent has a camp theme name, kindling, s'mores, canoe.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.040]   If Charleston has been open since March, look at this.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.480]   They've got Adirondack chairs.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.480]   California living.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.120]   Living is easy.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.160]   Look at this little log coffee table.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.160]   Just sit around.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.640]   They're all socially distanced.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.280]   Employees can return to their permanent desks in a rotation schedule.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.960]   So they make sure nobody's sitting near you.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:05.320]   Here's somebody pretending to work in kindling.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.800]   Camp, Camp Charleston.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.400]   I love Google.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.120]   There's Wi-Fi throughout, of course.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.280]   I'm sure it's very high speed.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   I think my favorite one is the inflatable walls.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.720]   Oh, let's look at the inflatable wall.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.720]   This is spherical.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:22.040]   But it's so incredibly slow.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.600]   It's like if you need some privacy, you wait for an inflatable wall.
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:25.680]   You can see how quickly it's moving.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:29.320]   The walls are slowly creeping across to fill this wall.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.320]   So there's a robot.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.320]   And slowly inflating.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.320]   There's a robot.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.160]   I guess there's a button you press that says, "I want privacy.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.680]   The robot comes to you."
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.680]   I should go to the very beginning because it spreads itself out.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.160]   And then it's slowly-- you're right.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.160]   I mean, this is sped up.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160]   Slowly--
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.200]   I like privacy 30 minutes from now.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.880]   This is like the pod people.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.200]   This is like it's enveloping you.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:56.760]   These milar kind of rainbow balloons are slowly, slowly.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.760]   Here it is.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   There's the robot.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   Look at this.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   Isn't that creepy?
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   This is invasion of the body snatchers.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.760]   This is what they're using all the old loon hardware for.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.640]   Oh, maybe these are old loon balloons.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.960]   That is so weird.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.680]   So weird.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:14.080]   I think there are definitely some interesting concepts here,
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.880]   other than the incredibly slow and deflatable wall.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.360]   But I mean, it's a little bit unfortunate for me
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.560]   to see so many companies making these major investments,
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.600]   trying to make their offices this kind of hybrid work
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.400]   environment work.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.800]   When so many people just want to stay home.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.080]   Let them stay home.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.320]   There are all these huge investments
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.200]   being made to develop these systems that ultimately,
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.440]   I don't think a lot of employees want.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.080]   I think if these companies would just spend a little bit of money
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.280]   to let people get a nice office chair at home,
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.000]   if they would pay for them to upgrade to the gigabit
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.120]   ethernet at home, then these people
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.560]   would be much happier just to stay there.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.720]   Companies can save so much money on real estate.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.760]   Their employees would be happy.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.960]   There's study after study shows that people who get to work
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.520]   from home are more productive.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.160]   They're more happy.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.800]   They're much more likely to stay at their current jobs.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   Thank you.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.040]   So why do they get away?
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.840]   Just keep trying to make this work.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:03.160]   Yeah, but is that a problem too?
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.120]   So it seems like a simple solution.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.200]   And they're instead of coming up with all these incredibly
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   complicated solutions to the wrong problem, might be new.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.280]   It's hysterical.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.040]   But this is so Google, isn't it?
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.640]   But these are experiments, though, right?
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.120]   This isn't them saying we built a new office,
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.200]   and this is how it's going to be.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.800]   These are all experiments to see,
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.200]   will any of these gel with people?
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.360]   Like, is this resonating?
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:25.800]   And then if they--
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.280]   I guess, I mean, this is the new Google campus
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.360]   they're building in Mountain View.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.920]   This is no experiment.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.280]   This is the real thing.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:39.160]   They're building this indoor park in Mountain View.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:43.800]   They've taken over many hundreds of acres to do this.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.320]   Some of it's experimental, but I think it's very Googly.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.960]   This is-- these are the team pods.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.680]   It doesn't actually look that much different than the campus
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.160]   does already.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.320]   It's always been Kuku with rainbow bicycles.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:55.760]   And yeah.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.400]   I would for an usher in the free food
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.160]   cafeterias and the bikes, of course.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.720]   Remember Facebook when they built their new campus marks
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.280]   that don't finish painting, just kind of half paint it.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.640]   There's a lot of exposed cement.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.200]   It looks like it's like--
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.080]   I guess, do you think it's--
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.560]   the young people don't want to work
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.360]   in a corporate environment.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360]   They want to work in something that looks like maybe
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.000]   downtown back alley.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.360]   I don't really understand, but--
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.120]   I don't need it.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.240]   I think you're big too, Seneca Leo.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.080]   When my husband creates a giant mess in the living room,
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.720]   I'm like dial up a robot.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   That's true.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.680]   I would like some privacy for this room.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:34.240]   Bring in the pod.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.320]   Don't even see it.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.960]   That's hysterical.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.280]   Speaking of YouTube Roku and YouTube
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.120]   in a little tussle, Roku does this all the time.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.440]   Now, starting their lose credibility.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:48.600]   They've removed YouTube TV from their channel store.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.800]   So if you have just a little public service warning,
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.160]   if you have YouTube TV and you use a Roku, don't delete it.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.200]   It'll still work, but you won't be able to get it.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.440]   Again, Roku's accused Google of--
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.560]   it's so much like--
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.320]   I don't know when you're at home.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.760]   If you have a satellite provider,
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.160]   they put up a thing saying CW is trying
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.600]   to get double the amount of money we pay.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.160]   So we're not going to-- five weeks,
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.640]   we're not going to carry CW.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.920]   And people write letters.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.160]   It's just BS negotiations.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.960]   Roku is accused Google of seeking unfair terms.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:26.400]   Unfair, I say, that would adversely
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.200]   affect streaming competitors and benefit
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   the YouTube suite of apps.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.880]   It's negotiations.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.520]   It's all just negotiating.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.120]   If this happened with Amazon a while back,
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:42.120]   it'll all--
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.120]   I'm sure--
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.560]   It happens all the time.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:51.080]   More often, it happens with cable channels, ESPN, CW.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.120]   You don't have any of this.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.400]   You've got the BBC 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.240]   So you don't have to worry about this in the UK.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:05.560]   But here in America, in America, we've got TV.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.480]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:10.760]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.640]   All right, let's start picking on Amazon.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:13.160]   You said it.
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:14.320]   Let's start picking on them.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:20.240]   Profit sores, 220% in quarantine.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.480]   I'm sure I contributed--
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.200]   All thanks to me.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.040]   Between Tim and me.
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.040]   You really do.
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.000]   Yep, yep.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.080]   You know, my Amazon Echo--
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.960]   I have to turn this off.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.200]   It gives me a notification when a package is on its way.
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.720]   But it's like, that's every day.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.920]   So I don't really need to be--
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:41.760]   I turned off the new email notification years ago,
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.040]   because of course there's new email.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.680]   Of course, there's a package today.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:52.520]   $8.5 billion in sales in the quarter,
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:56.400]   $8 billion in profit in the quarter.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.840]   Not quite Google money, but OK.
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:04.120]   Amazon's profit, of course, is completely--
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:06.720]   I always joke, Jeff Bezos has a dial in his office.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.680]   And you know, let's turn the profit up a little bit here.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.600]   But a very exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.600]   Actually, they've been profitable ever since Bezos
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.880]   announced he was going to retire.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.080]   Of course, the big bucks for Amazon is AWS.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:25.680]   Amazon Web Service is a juggernaut, $13.5 billion
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.040]   in sales.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.800]   Microsoft's cloud business up, but it's still
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:33.680]   a fraction of what Amazon makes.
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.200]   $50 billion in capital expenditures here.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.240]   This is what we were talking about, Breonna, in the last 12
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.600]   months.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.080]   So they're not just buying back stock.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.960]   I don't even know if Amazon does buy back stock.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:46.720]   That seems like something Bezos would never do.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.560]   I think it's going to be really interesting
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.960]   to see if their profits stay where they are.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:53.480]   I mean, I never thought I'd be going, wow,
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.800]   I can't wait to go shopping for groceries.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.520]   That's exactly where I am.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:01.200]   I've had everything delivered for over a year.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.240]   And I'm curious if this is going to be like a permanent change
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.720]   for consumers or if it's not.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:09.480]   I think it's going to be the one.
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:09.800]   I'm curious too.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.200]   You might say, oh, I got to go shopping.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.080]   Go say, that's nice.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:16.160]   Now I'm going to order from now on.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.360]   Because right?
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.080]   Because you missed it.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.800]   But then you realize, you know, it's kind of a pain in the ass.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.200]   I mean, Amazon just opened a hair salon in London.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.520]   So it's got some pretty--
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.000]   Take off that hat, Nate.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.800]   Let's see what they did to you.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.480]   Are you hiding the Amazon hair?
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.480]   I tell you what.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.040]   Let me just see exactly.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.760]   No, so my wife was cutting my hair for the dust.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.800]   That's why you were in the hat.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.280]   That looks good.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:43.680]   It's all right.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.560]   My wife didn't do this.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.200]   This one I had done because I was back on set professionally.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.320]   Professionally cut here.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:53.280]   And I needed to look a little bit better on that set.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:58.560]   But yeah, no, they opened a salon late April.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:03.560]   I think it's predominantly maybe for employees.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.160]   But I think it's opening up a bit more widely.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.000]   It's in East London.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.720]   Anytime Amazon does something like that,
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:13.840]   you have to say, well, OK, is this a new field they want to get into?
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:18.880]   Remember those Amazon ghost stores that they launched employee only at first?
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:19.760]   Now they're spreading.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:24.120]   And Amazon's saying they're going to sell that technology to regular grocery stores.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:29.160]   Lisa and I were actually shopping at a grocery store the other day.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:33.200]   And it's one of those grocery stores, Brianna, that has the self-checkout.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.960]   And I said, oh, let's go to the self-checkout.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.000]   She said, that never works.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.600]   Every time I use it, somebody has to come over and fix it.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.200]   So it's not--
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.920]   But at Amazon's, and I said, well, someday, you won't even have to go through a checkout line.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.280]   The way Amazon works, they're just watching you all the time.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:53.640]   And they see what you picked up and put in the cart.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.320]   And they charge you probably before you leave the store.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.920]   So it saves a lot of time.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:03.400]   Anyway, I don't know if they'll do that with the haircut.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.280]   What's-- is there anything new about the haircut?
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.920]   I think that you have virtual reality, right?
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.800]   You can see what they look like.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:11.400]   They have fire tablets, I think, in front of you.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.120]   And it does an augmented reality before and after.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:18.520]   You can pick what you want to have done.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.320]   I've not been yet.
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.400]   It literally opened two weeks ago.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:24.000]   And obviously, with lockdown, it's been quite challenging.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.200]   But I do intend to go at some point, probably for my next one.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.320]   But they've been doing some really interesting stuff in Britain.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:36.840]   They started opening grocery stores in the high streets here, which they have done in the US beforehand.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.960]   But they opened the first one in London about--
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:40.600]   They're expanding.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.720]   --cup two or three months ago.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.760]   This is not a hobby.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.400]   This is not an experiment at this point.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.240]   This is a business.
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:47.840]   That's why you wonder when they open their hair salons.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:52.520]   Do they have bathrooms or do you pee in a bottle at the hair salons?
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.600]   Well, in Britain, we like to have bathrooms in our hair salons.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.920]   This is a bad joke, and obviously--
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.560]   I'm just going to keep it going.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.400]   Thank you.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.200]   It's like half midnight here.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:04.720]   So my--
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:05.520]   Yeah, I understand.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.400]   --cups and the humors beginning to--
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.800]   I don't blame you one cotton-picking bit.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.400]   You're not alone.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:16.280]   Personally, I take my own bottle just to be safe in case you get the cool show.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.720]   Samsung had an event in which they announced new laptops,
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:26.680]   including a Galaxy Book Odyssey with the RTX 3050 Ti, a gaming laptop,
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.360]   which won't be available to the end of the summer.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.280]   Are we excited?
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.120]   Do we care?
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.240]   I mean, I care.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:39.440]   I think a lot of these RTX 30 chips are very power-constrained, as far as what the--
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:42.400]   You have to wonder what it could do in a laptop, yeah.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:47.800]   I've actually-- I've seen studies that show the 3090 notebook version versus the 3080--
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.760]   I'm sorry, the 3070 notebook version versus the 3080,
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.480]   because the power is so constrained, there's virtually no difference in performance.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.400]   So I think, unfortunately, this is one of these things.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:04.880]   We need to wait for an intact look at it, to give us some real numbers.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.600]   Don't believe the marketing hype on this stuff, y'all.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.560]   I'm like, wait for the numbers to come out before investing your money.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.560]   You've got that beast.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.200]   I presume you do your speed runs.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.680]   Where do you do your speed runs?
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680]   Do you do it?
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.760]   It depends on what I'm doing it for.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.240]   So that particular one was on the PS4.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:27.560]   You know, for an NES or SNES, you've got to play an original hardware where it doesn't
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:28.560]   count.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.040]   Oh, yeah, because the computer is only--
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.040]   Right.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.880]   The computer is only there to basically record it.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:42.280]   There are games like Doom where you can actually-- a lot of the ways you cheat is by cranking
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:49.000]   the frame rate up to 300 frames a second, and it lets you bypass things with momentum
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.800]   so you can shoot all the way out the map if you can cheat your frame rate.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:37:01.720]   So I should get more into that.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.960]   Would you ever game on a laptop, given what you've got on your desk?
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:05.960]   Of course I would.
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:06.960]   Of course I would.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.040]   I mean, it's seven, stuff like that.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.400]   You know, laptops are just taking over.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:15.640]   I see so many people talking about gaming laptops these days, and I think, is that really
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.120]   a good choice?
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.520]   But okay.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:27.440]   Meanwhile, Amazon made money, Facebook made money, Apple made money, Google made money,
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.760]   Twitter stock plunges on user, miss and low guidance.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.280]   The company reported revenue of $1 billion.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:42.240]   That was up 28%, but it wasn't enough to get the stock market excited.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:46.680]   The total number of monetizable is a new stat.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.120]   Monotizable daily users.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:56.040]   It did grow by $7 million to $199 million, but far short of analyst expectations.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.400]   Now $199 million is not a lot of users, especially when you take a Facebook, which is what-- it's
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.000]   got to be close to $3 billion now, right?
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.920]   I guess it all depends on scale.
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:14.080]   I bet for a company like Basecamp, they've got to be happy to have 190 million users.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.240]   I don't think they should be happy to have somebody at the Basecamp.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.080]   I think 15 employees left this week.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:21.080]   I heard that.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.080]   It's a drama.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.080]   Teen employees.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.920]   One third of their staff.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:31.600]   So in case you haven't been following this, Casey Newton had kind of an expose on platformer.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:39.320]   He's a new sovereign writer blog, which turns out Basecamp, which is run by Jason Freed and
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:41.080]   David Hannah Meiner-Hanson.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.760]   They're considered kind of innovators in new ways to work.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:47.400]   In fact, Jason wrote a book called "Rework," all about the new ways of work.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.440]   They're considered very woken with it and hip.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:56.880]   But apparently, they shut down conversations on the company's internal Basecamp about race
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.680]   issues, about diversity issues.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.240]   They basically said, "No more talk about this."
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:08.000]   Employees are pissed.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.560]   I suspect this is just me.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.360]   I suspect it's about more than this.
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.840]   Yeah, before coming on Basecamp, I really want to make it clear.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:16.840]   I use these products.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.840]   I use hay.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:18.840]   I love it.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:22.040]   We use Basecamp at Rebellion.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:28.800]   I feel like sometimes people root for companies to fail like it's a sport.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.280]   These are institutions that people put their lives in.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.640]   No, and I know Jason, or I've interviewed Jason and David both many times.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.120]   David Hannah Meiner-Hanson created Ruby on Rails.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:42.800]   It was originally 37 signals.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.320]   I have huge respect for them.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:47.040]   We don't really know what happened.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.400]   We know what Casey Newton said happened based on interviews and employees.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:59.000]   To his credit, Jason did say, "If you don't like the new policies, we will offer you a
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.760]   generous severance package."
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:04.200]   That's probably why 15 employees took advantage.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.760]   Actually, it's 18 now.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.520]   18 people have tweeted that they're going to leave.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.040]   It might have to do more with the severance pay than anything else.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.400]   These were key people, Leo.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.280]   This was the entire iOS team.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:16.920]   This was their chief marketing person.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:22.200]   These were key people.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:27.680]   Just to give a little bit more background to your listeners and viewers, what had happened
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:35.880]   was there was a person at Basecamp, according to Casey Newton, and David has verified this,
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.840]   that cut the list of "the best names ever."
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.440]   Names that were so horrific, no one will tell us what they were.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.040]   Some of them were silly, according to Newton.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.320]   You had things like Bart Simpson's "prey calling" name.
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.240]   This to be clear.
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:58.960]   These are names people signed up for Basecamp with, probably mostly phony joke names.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:06.760]   Casey compared them to when Bart calls Mo the bartender and says, "Can I speak to Hug and
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.760]   Hold?"
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:08.760]   "See more butts."
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.760]   "See more butts."
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:14.400]   "See more butts, is it called for you?"
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.560]   "It's an old prank thing."
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.760]   He compared it to "See more butts" and "Amanda Hug and Hold."
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:24.840]   But I think that the fact that no one will say what these names were, I think they're
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.920]   probably racist.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:26.920]   They're sexist.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.920]   They're probably awful.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.920]   Yeah, probably.
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:32.720]   It's probably making fun of it.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:42.080]   My guess here is David and they're both people who I respect them professionally, but let's
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.520]   be honest.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:49.960]   They have a little bit of ego in the way that they conduct themselves in their professional
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.960]   roles.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.600]   And David particularly, we had him on a show basically picking a giant public fight with
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.080]   Apple, which we supported with, "Hey, you remember that?
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.080]   Yeah."
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:09.040]   And so I suspect this isn't just about a list or shutting down politics at work.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.480]   My feeling that I get, if you really read into some of these tweets, is that it's about
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:19.880]   a wider company feeling that they didn't feel heard by their founders.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.720]   Particularly, the diversity committee that they had started, a lot of people on that
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.000]   committee said that they didn't feel they had a voice or they could make an impact on
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000]   the company.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.400]   So I think this is just frankly about a lot more than talking about politics at work.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.400]   Yeah, it must be.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:44.320]   Well, I was reading the letter that they sent out, the blog post that they sent out.
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:47.920]   And honestly, I could see myself writing this, to be honest.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.280]   I'll give you one of the quotes.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.000]   "Today's social and political waters are especially choppy.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.920]   Sensitivity is at 11 and every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy or society at
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:02.520]   large quickly spins away from pleasant.
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:06.160]   You shouldn't have to wonder if staying out of it means you're complicit or waiting into
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.600]   it means you're a target.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.480]   These are difficult enough waters to navigate in life, but significantly more so at work.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.480]   It's become too much.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.040]   It's a major distraction.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.320]   It saps our energy and redirects our dialogue towards dark places.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.320]   It's not healthy.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.040]   It hasn't served us well.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:26.480]   And we're done with it on our company base camp account where the work happens.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:31.400]   People can take the conversations with willing coworkers to signal WhatsApp or even a personal
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:34.640]   base camp account, but it can't happen where the work happens anymore.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:37.320]   I can see writing that.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:38.760]   I understand that.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:46.040]   Those conversations can become very problematic, toxic, difficult, uncomfortable, and people
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.760]   are trying to get work done.
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.240]   I could see saying that.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:56.440]   I think there's a hard discussion to be had about, how can I put this?
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.280]   People don't yell at me.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:04.880]   There is a difficult conversation to be had about toxic activism.
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:09.280]   I personally see this a lot online.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:15.240]   The way I can square it in my Twitter presence sometimes is when someone's screaming at you,
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:19.200]   I think it really comes down to them telling you, "I matter.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.200]   I hurt.
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.240]   I'm not being heard.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.800]   This is important."
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:24.800]   That I understand.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:27.160]   Yeah, but I also think it's true.
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:33.040]   It comes out in some ways that, especially in the workplace, I run a political pack.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.680]   We make political ads.
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:39.160]   I very deliberately don't ask people who they vote for.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:45.480]   We try to keep it much more about the product versus what we ourselves think.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:50.360]   I do think there's a discussion to be had here about how we go about it.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.680]   I suspect that this company base camp just wasn't one where the companies felt like they
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:57.440]   could have a productive conference.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:03.400]   Me, being the cynic, might think it's .2 in the blog post where he says, "For years,
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:07.920]   we've offered a fitness benefit, a wellness allowance, a farmer's market share and continuing
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.080]   education allowances.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.080]   They felt good at the time.
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.080]   We've had a change of heart.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.680]   It's none of our business, what you do outside of work.
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:18.560]   It's not base camps plan to encourage certain behaviors regardless of good intention.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:21.200]   Basically they ended those benefits.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.480]   Now, they're going to give them cash instead, which is fair.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.960]   I think it sounds like a good workplace, to be honest with you.
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:33.680]   I feel like there's more to the story than we saw in the Casey Newton article.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:38.440]   They also eliminated committees, not bad.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.680]   No more 360 reviews.
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:43.480]   Those are horrible.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.680]   It's good to get rid of those.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.280]   That's peer feedback.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:53.240]   That's where people shoot at each other anonymously, not good.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:57.040]   I think Jason and David are thoughtful.
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:05.360]   I think the hay.com thing was a good example of David being a little abrasive and maybe
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:06.960]   somewhat inappropriately.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.920]   He also remember he was the guy who tweeted, "My apple card gave me a much higher credit
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:17.600]   limit than my wife, even though we should have the same credit.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   It's unfair.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:19.600]   Apple actually had a big investigation.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:24.880]   FTC had a big investigation that cleared Goldman Sachs just recently on that."
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:32.320]   These guys are big people, big personalities.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.040]   When you work at 37 Signals or Base Camp, you're really working just as you would be a twit
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.400]   inside the sphere of their personality.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:41.000]   Maybe it's great to a little bit.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   I understand.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.880]   It definitely reeks of hubris and ego to me as well.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:52.040]   I feel like that is really contradictory to what's needed to have good management.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.520]   This whole thing just reeks of HR disaster of them really not having the structure and
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.600]   the framework, the support system in place to ensure that employees feel like their
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.240]   voices are being heard.
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:07.000]   If you're having to shut down a portion of discussion, sure, I can definitely see why
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.080]   you might feel the need to do so, but to do it in such a heavy handed way and to do it
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:15.840]   in a public way like this, whereas presumably maybe there were some individuals who were
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:20.160]   more outspoken than others who were causing issues, these are situations that should be
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:25.480]   taken care of in a one-on-one, a direct way rather than just dropping the ban hammer on
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:28.840]   basically the entire company and thinking that's going to go down well.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:33.440]   Obviously, it just reeks of poor management skills to me.
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.440]   It's the ban hammer.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.360]   That's actually a good way to put it.
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.360]   You wouldn't want it, and not in public either.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.120]   You would want to do this in a more subtle, responsive way that just say, "Shut up.
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.120]   I don't want to hear it.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.120]   Go away."
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.120]   It's tricky.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.720]   It's no fun running a company.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.360]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.520]   That's why I let Lisa do all the hard work.
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:59.320]   I just sit here on my duff and talk.
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:03.040]   Let's do another break, and we'll be back with more.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.040]   What a great panel.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.760]   Tim Stevens is here.
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.040]   Tell me about Roadshow.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.520]   It's just all cars all the time.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.640]   Roadshow is CNET's automotive section, so pretty much we are focused on everything to
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:16.640]   do with automotive.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:20.160]   Of course, technology is a huge part of what we cover with cars, but we cover everything,
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.680]   driving dynamics, performance, efficiency, and what's latest and greatest on personal
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.840]   mobility as well, Uber and Lyft and all that good stuff.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.840]   I see your talking.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:30.400]   Everything to do with mobility.
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.680]   Talking about NASCAR and Spotify's $80 car thing.
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:35.520]   Have you tried that?
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.120]   I have not had the opportunity to do some interesting.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.120]   No, no.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.320]   We're hoping to get our hands on soon though.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.200]   Here's a motorcycle stuff too.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:43.280]   Oh, nice.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.280]   The Indian Challenger.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:45.280]   Wow.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.280]   That's cool.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:48.040]   Click on the article about car ramps.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:51.160]   I need some of those.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.160]   The best car.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.640]   See, they really cover the waterfront.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.520]   Best car ramps for 2021.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:58.720]   Apparently that black widow.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:48:59.880]   Man, that's good.
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.920]   That's not a good name for a car ramp, however.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:04.280]   It is not actually, at least not a widow maker.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.720]   It's a widow maker.
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:12.560]   Rhino gears got the best, most affordable because they're about 30% less than the black widow.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.400]   That's what I got in my garage.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.760]   Race ramps, if you get a low profile car.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.160]   Is your car low rake, Brianna?
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.600]   I believe it is.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:20.600]   Well, it is.
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:27.000]   I'm redoing an air conditioner right now in the 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera, which involves
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.800]   a lot of being under the car.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.440]   The lines are gone after 34 years.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:36.480]   So yeah, I definitely need that.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:40.600]   I think you need the Tektanga three ton wide car service ramp.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:41.600]   That's what I think.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:44.600]   That's what I get if I were you to every any.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.960]   Yeah, that's a great car ramp, dude.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.760]   That's the kind of, you know, we always use down at the shop because this is hysterical.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:53.880]   I can't look at that.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:54.880]   Look at that.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.200]   Oh, yeah, that's a ramp.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:57.200]   You could see the welds.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:00.120]   It's not a ramp unless you can see the welds.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:02.480]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:07.640]   This is a CNET product roadshow by CNET.
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:11.600]   Tim is the boss, guy in charge.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.240]   This is a good thing for you, isn't it, Tim?
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.360]   You get to talk about cars all the time.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.680]   Yeah, I mean, I've always loved cars.
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:23.280]   When I was a kid, I didn't think that automotive journalism was really a job that real people
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:26.640]   had because, you know, could you really make a go with that?
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:28.080]   Could people really pay you for that?
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.320]   But yeah, I mean, obviously technology journalism was huge for me and being, being,
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.800]   able to do that for a long time has been great.
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:37.720]   But yeah, automotive has always been my first passion.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.080]   So they have a chance to really focus on that for the past six years.
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:42.080]   And that has been incredible.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.080]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:44.560]   Well, and cars really are high tech devices now.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.560]   I mean, more.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:46.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:51.160]   And it's been great to watch that transition, you know, at a gadget and that now here it's
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:56.000]   seen at starting with, you know, covering Microsoft and partnering with Ford on Sync.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000]   And then, you know, everything kind of blowing up from there has been a great ride.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.280]   Oh, and by the way, Chumlee has just said, this is what you need, really.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:05.040]   And you need the quick Jack BL 5000.
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:06.120]   I've looked at that.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:08.120]   That's actually one of the two.
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:09.640]   One of those two.
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:10.640]   I do.
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:11.640]   Oh, Lord.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:13.880]   The problem is it takes like three weeks to get one of these.
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.200]   So I'm going to wait until I'm on vacation.
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:19.040]   Now I'm going to order it and then it will be at my house when I come back.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:22.720]   Their customer service is a little questionable, I got to say, but I can do some pro tips on
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.720]   that.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:26.440]   Do you still use Jack stands when you use that or do you feel comfortable?
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.440]   I don't actually.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.920]   I feel pretty comfortable with it.
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:31.280]   There's some backups in there locks in place pretty good.
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.120]   All right.
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:35.600]   Well, you know, when I got up this morning, the last thing I thought I'd be doing today
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.760]   on Twitter is talking about car Jacks.
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:40.680]   That's what I love about this show.
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:42.680]   You just never, never know.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:44.640]   Brianna, I said we were going to hijack the show.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.200]   I think you got it.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:47.520]   You carjacked it.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:50.040]   Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:54.000]   I got my iPhone SE from Mint Mobile plugged in that Mint Mobile SIM.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.760]   And now I'm wondering why do I go anywhere else?
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:02.080]   And I have to say, when I first heard about Mint Mobile, I thought really $15 a month?
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:09.600]   After years of fine print contracts getting ripped off by the big wireless providers,
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.760]   we've learned at least one thing.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:13.200]   There's always a catch.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:17.240]   So when I heard that Mint Mobile offers a premium wireless service for $15 a month,
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.320]   I thought, wait, what's a catch?
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:23.000]   But after speaking with them and most importantly, after using their service, it all made sense.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.200]   In fact, I said, wait a minute.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.160]   They've got a $30 month unlimited plan.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.160]   This is incredible.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:34.440]   Mint Mobile's secret sauce is they're the first company to sell wireless service online only.
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:37.000]   No stores, no crazy overhead.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.360]   The savings get passed down to you and that is huge, sweet savings.
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.880]   These guys, they cut costs like crazy.
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:49.960]   What they don't cut is service premium, wireless service.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:54.880]   All the plans come with unlimited talk and text plus high speed data delivered on the
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.120]   nation's largest 5G network.
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:59.120]   It's team mobile.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:00.640]   Don't tell them I told you.
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.800]   It's team mobile.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:03.120]   They're an MVNO.
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:07.000]   So what they're doing, what you're doing is instead of paying, by the way, for the exact
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:13.440]   same service, I pay team mobile three times more for the exact same service.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.600]   So instead of doing that, why not?
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:16.600]   They'll send you the SIM.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:18.360]   They don't even charge you for that.
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:20.400]   I just think it's fantastic.
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.200]   This is a great company offering a great deal.
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.320]   You can use your own phone.
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.240]   You could port your phone number over just like that.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:28.240]   It's very easy.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:29.440]   So you'll keep your same phone number.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.320]   You'll keep your same contacts, but you'll get a great phone.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320]   They also sell phones.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.040]   That's where I got the iPhone SE.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.680]   That was 15 bucks a month, 15 bucks a month in service.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:40.480]   So for 30 bucks a month, I get a new phone and great service.
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.080]   I mean, this is incredible.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.080]   Incredible.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:46.160]   If you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered with their seven day money
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:47.160]   back guarantee.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:48.440]   I liked it so much.
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.040]   The service was so good.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:55.120]   Switch now to Mint Mobile to get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.920]   get the plan shipped to you for free.
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:59.760]   Go to mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:03.400]   That's mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.840]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:07.960]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:08.960]   That's all you have to know.
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:11.280]   Mint Mobile is great.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:15.560]   I stand behind it.
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.720]   The oh gosh, there's so many stories.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:19.360]   Let's move quickly.
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:29.000]   As long as we're talking about cars, GE rolls out seamless EV charging across multiple networks.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.640]   They call it Altium Charge 360.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:37.240]   This is one of the issues, of course, anybody who buys an electric car that's not Tesla
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:40.760]   is concerned, well, where am I going to charge it when I'm away from home?
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.680]   Tesla's got the supercharger network.
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:48.920]   But now, thanks to Electrify America and all the charge point, there's a lot of them.
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:49.920]   Vigo.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:57.360]   GM says we're going to solve this by allowing you to use any of these fast charging systems.
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:59.120]   I think that's a good idea.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:02.040]   Yeah, starting to get easier, not that long ago.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.960]   And really, for most people today, you still need to have three or four different apps
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:09.560]   on your phone and maybe carry around a couple of different membership cards with you.
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:12.120]   You really need to subscribe to all these in advance if you're really going to do a
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.120]   road trip because you never know what you're going to know.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:17.920]   You can't be sitting in the parking lot there trying to type your credit card number in
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.600]   and subscribe to some service.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:22.160]   So that really needs to get much easier.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.320]   And that's really what GM is doing.
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.560]   Porsche is also doing this as well.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.760]   And the goal is ultimately to standardize things and help that you can really just plug
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:31.520]   your car in and then all your credentials will be stored on your car.
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:33.200]   That's what Ford does with the Maki.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.200]   It's good.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.360]   They've got Ford Pass.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.960]   So in fact, they gave me 500,000 kilowatt hours.
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:42.360]   So it's a couple of thousand dollars with electricity to start.
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:43.760]   You plug it in.
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:48.960]   The car, the charger I was just did at Electrify America the other day for our hands-on tech
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:49.960]   show.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:51.880]   The car says, "Hello, it's me.
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:52.880]   It's Leo."
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.880]   It worked perfectly.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.880]   The machine said, "Oh, great.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:55.880]   You don't have to enter anything.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:57.880]   We know who you are."
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:00.200]   And they bill you in.
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.200]   It's automatic.
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:02.200]   And that's exactly how it's.
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:03.680]   That's how it was with the Supercharger network.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:05.800]   It's just the way it should be.
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:07.720]   There's a story that came out this week.
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:09.440]   Tim, was this one of yours?
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:11.000]   Maybe I'm misremembering it.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:17.520]   It was asking why I believe it was 20% of people that buy an electric vehicle eventually
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.280]   go back to a gas engine.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.280]   What?
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.240]   Now, interestingly, it's not Tesla people.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:30.000]   It is people that buy like the Nissan Leaf or some of the earlier Ford versions.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.800]   The compliance cars.
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:32.800]   Right.
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:39.320]   And the number one reason was charging it was a hassle, particularly if you live in an
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.560]   apartment complex or something like that.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.560]   It's not the technology.
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:44.560]   It's the infrastructure.
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:46.440]   And that's understandable, actually.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.440]   Right.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:48.440]   Of course.
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:52.120]   Portia, before they brought out the Taycan, they announced a massive investment.
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:58.040]   If I remember correctly, it was close to a billion dollars in charging infrastructure
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.480]   through the United States.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:04.720]   So I think that, I mean, all of us here, we take this problem seriously.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:10.960]   And I think that getting that infrastructure right is just absolutely going to be key.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:11.960]   That's Elon was brilliant.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:15.840]   I have to say, and Elon's a very funny guy because sometimes he's brilliant.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:19.360]   Sometimes he's incredibly stupid, but he was brilliant in that.
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:23.040]   He said, "We're not going to sell any Teslas unless it's easy to charge."
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:27.000]   And he knew that he had to build that supercharger of business at the same time as he's
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.240]   building the Tesla business.
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:30.240]   It was actually absolutely right.
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.840]   It was fascinating to me as how much of that is a psychological game.
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:39.160]   It's people who won't really need to use supercharger ever, maybe they'll use it once
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:40.240]   or twice a year.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:46.040]   And so the revenue model on charging stations is kind of questionable because most people
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:48.280]   really, again, won't need them.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:51.800]   But they need to exist for people to feel comfortable and not to be.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:52.800]   Exactly.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.560]   And that's one of the reasons why it's so important that Volkswagen has been pouring
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:01.280]   so much money into America unwillingly, but they've been doing it at least to establish
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:04.480]   that network to make it easier and to make people feel more comfortable about using
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:05.480]   those chargers.
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:12.400]   We have across the street, there's an Outlem all with a couple of two different Chathamo
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.720]   companies and a fast charger from Electrify America.
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:20.480]   And I've never used it because I just plug it in when I get home.
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:21.720]   It just makes sense.
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:28.000]   Hey, speaking of Elon and SpaceX and used cars, I'm going to tie this all together,
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.480]   SpaceX made its first nighttime splashdown.
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:32.480]   It was beautiful.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:35.840]   Let me see if I can rewind this video because it was incredible.
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:36.840]   It was incredible.
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:55.160]   We have the crew one in the
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:59:01.520]   splashdown with astronauts since 1968.
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.280]   This is from NASA TV.
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:09.840]   But this is a used capsule.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:12.040]   And this is one of the things Musk has done.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:19.760]   I actually was asking our space guy, Rod Pyle, who's with the Space Society.
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:20.760]   Is it really a savings?
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:23.960]   And he said, you know, there's maybe...
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:25.060]   Look, he's happy.
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:26.060]   He's happy to be back.
[01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:29.440]   They're doing a little happy dance as he gets out of the capsule.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.760]   That's really awesome.
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:35.400]   Reusing does save considerable amount of money.
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:40.000]   And it also just seems more environmentally friendly not to just get rid of these capsules.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:45.240]   So that dragon capsule had been used once before, the crew dragon.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:46.840]   And refurbished.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.400]   They cleaned out the ashtrays.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:51.480]   I think they hose down the upholstery.
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:53.880]   So it's practically new.
[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:54.880]   It's fresh.
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:55.880]   It's clean.
[01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:01.460]   I could be in one in Florida a week, a little bit more than a week from now.
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:03.460]   We're going to spend two days at NASA.
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:04.460]   So...
[02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:06.740]   You're going to see a launch?
[02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:09.060]   We're going to try to see what's going on down there.
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:14.340]   But the last time I was there, if I remember correctly, SpaceX was looking at taking over
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:18.420]   the pad that they used to launch as a challenger, which was...
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:22.460]   Yeah, that was a huge moment for me as a child.
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:23.460]   So...
[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:24.460]   Watching it...
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:25.460]   Yeah, very sad.
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:26.460]   It was traumatic.
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:27.460]   You were a child?
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:28.460]   Yeah.
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:29.460]   Oh, Lord.
[02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:32.260]   Of course you were.
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:35.300]   What am I thinking?
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:42.100]   Let's see.
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:45.740]   Florida has passed a law.
[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:50.300]   That's all you have to say.
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:55.740]   Florida has passed or is about to pass a law that will ban tech companies from deep platforming
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:01:00.660]   politicians.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:05.020]   Of course it's unconstitutional because I do believe there is an amendment to the Constitution.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:09.420]   I think it's the first one in the Bill of Rights that says, "Congress shall make no law
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:10.940]   bridging the freedom of speech.
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:12.620]   Of course, this is a state.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:18.140]   There's also interstate commerce because Twitter and YouTube and Facebook aren't in Florida.
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:24.340]   Anyway, they could be fined for banning political candidates.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:25.340]   It's expected to be signed.
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:33.060]   It's passed to the Florida legislature and I'm sure Ron DeSantis will sign it.
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:37.220]   I guess what's next is if he doesn't like your commentary on this, he can pass another
[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:38.220]   law.
[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.220]   Yeah, ban Twitch.
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:41.580]   You've got to say, "Well, he likes on Twitch."
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:42.580]   This is hot garbage.
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:48.540]   This is just trash.
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:53.900]   Dealing with criticism and working with systems, I can tell you firsthand, I don't particularly
[02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:55.340]   like the Boston Globe.
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:02:02.060]   I had to work with them when I was running for office.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.220]   It's just ridiculous the government trying to tell a private company who they have to
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:08.100]   facilitate and who they don't.
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:10.260]   It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:12.580]   Florida House voted 77 and 38 in favor.
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:15.460]   The Senate 23 to 17.
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:20.060]   It would allow suspensions of up to two weeks and a service can remove individual posts if
[02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:22.100]   they violate the terms of service.
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:27.260]   But if you quote, "deplatform political candidate," in other words, permanently delete or ban them
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:32.260]   as Twitter and Facebook did to the former president, you could be fined up to a quarter
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:40.660]   million dollars a day for statewide candidates and $25,000 a day for the little guys.
[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:45.340]   I think this is not going to survive a test in court.
[02:02:45.340 --> 02:02:47.340]   I agree.
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:48.340]   Yeah.
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:49.500]   Let's see.
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:53.900]   I'm trying to cherry pick the good stuff.
[02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:55.460]   I feel bad for Volkswagen.
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:57.460]   This is a roadshow story.
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:01.740]   Volkswagen did their April Fool's joke just a little bit early announcing that Volkswagen
[02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:05.060]   America was going to be rebranded as Volt.
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:09.460]   V-O-L-T, Volt's wagon America.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:12.580]   Apparently the SEC is not investigating.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:13.820]   Come on.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:16.180]   Come on.
[02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:17.180]   On what ground?
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:19.460]   This was bad.
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:26.420]   Basically that, well, of course, that there was an impact to the stock price based on this
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:27.420]   release.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:32.860]   And so therefore the company valuation went up based on fake news.
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:36.140]   The reason that I think you should not feel bad for Volkswagen is because they really
[02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:37.140]   sold this.
[02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:39.180]   I've been covering tech journalism for a long time now.
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:41.380]   I've survived many.
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:48.340]   On April Fool's day, I've never seen a company do what Volkswagen did to make this see believable.
[02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:50.300]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:54.060]   Every time in the history of my doing tech and automotive journalism, if I ever had a
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:58.780]   doubt that a story was real or not, I would get on the phone with a representative and
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:00.460]   say, hey, seriously?
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:02.140]   And they'd say, you know, of course not.
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:04.180]   It's April Fool's joke.
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:07.580]   On the record, off the record, we were told up and down this is absolutely legit.
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:11.660]   In the way that they structured in time the releases to go out, it actually, this release
[02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:13.700]   accidentally leaked, quote unquote leaked.
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:16.260]   The same time as another embargoed press release that was supposed to go out.
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:19.580]   They did everything to perfection to make this look like an actual story.
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:21.900]   And it's more up and down that it was true.
[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:23.980]   So we bought it.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:25.460]   I feel terrible that we did.
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:30.340]   We report on this as fact, as did most other major journalistic outlets in the world.
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:34.900]   And yeah, there was a tangible increase in evaluation of Volkswagen for the day that
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:39.580]   actually persisted long after the reports came out that this was indeed fake.
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:41.820]   So that's why the SEC is involved.
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:46.100]   I'm very curious to see what the reaction is going to be to this because, yeah, I'm
[02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:49.900]   frankly, you can probably tell I'm still pretty mad about the way that this sit down.
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:51.340]   You were burned, man.
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:52.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:53.340]   We were burned.
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:55.420]   Yeah, that's the first time that I've ever been burned like this.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:56.940]   And I hope that it never happens again.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:57.940]   Wow.
[02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:01.820]   I didn't realize that they went on the record with reporters saying it's not a joke.
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:05.700]   I know that they put that in the press release, but that's not right.
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:08.460]   That's not that breaks your relationship.
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:11.060]   And Volkswagen has some problems already.
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:12.060]   Yeah.
[02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:18.380]   I mean, the idea that Volkswagen lying to people about, you know, taking electrification
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:22.660]   very seriously and taking emissions very seriously, who thought that that was going to be a funny
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:24.540]   thing that we would all be laughing about.
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:26.900]   You know, the whole point of a full stage, hey, this is cute.
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:27.900]   This is fun.
[02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:28.900]   This is entertaining.
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:33.460]   Here, Volkswagen, who's still really, you know, walking around with a black eye, thanks
[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:37.220]   to diesel gain, everything else around there is now joking about, you know, taking emissions
[02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:39.100]   cutting very seriously.
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:42.780]   I don't know what they thought was going to come from this, but certainly a lot of negative
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:43.780]   is coming for it.
[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:45.780]   And I hope that more continues to.
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:50.340]   We all know what's so frustrating is, you know, a lot of the technology that Porsche is
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:56.620]   doing with the Ticon is going to filter through, you know, Audi and Volkswagen, which is part
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:57.780]   of the same autogritt.
[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:02.340]   They have a really promising feature ahead of them here.
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:07.580]   And it's just, it's, I mean, it's not just like the stock risk that they're doing.
[02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:13.580]   It's so counterproductive to burn relationships with people like you because I bet when that
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:18.580]   technology does filter down, Tim, I mean, you're not going to be taking that phone call
[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:21.220]   as fast as maybe you were a year ago.
[02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:26.220]   And that week I was literally working on a review of the ID for, which is Volkswagen's
[02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:28.500]   new EV in the US, which is a fantastic car.
[02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:32.900]   So, you know, I had to put all that baggage in the backseat literally and swallow by pride
[02:06:32.900 --> 02:06:35.900]   to say, this is a really, really good car that Volkswagen has produced here.
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:37.060]   You know, this is an excellent EV.
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:40.100]   If you were looking for a first EV, this is a really great choice.
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:44.260]   But you know, meanwhile, I'm feeling incredibly, you know, upset at the company for their handling
[02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:45.540]   of this whole shebang.
[02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:49.460]   So, yeah, it made things very, very complicated and it still is just so discreet.
[02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:53.580]   I really think we have to call time on April Fool's stories.
[02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:54.580]   Yes.
[02:06:54.580 --> 02:06:57.500]   And they say, and they are second.
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:00.540]   They should be, they should be ludicrous.
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:01.540]   So ridiculous.
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:03.340]   They couldn't possibly be true.
[02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:04.340]   Yeah.
[02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:06.340]   And they can only come out on April 1st.
[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:07.340]   Yes.
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:08.340]   Yeah.
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:12.220]   I mean, we've seen some great products announced on April 1st, like Gmail, wasn't it?
[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:16.220]   Everyone thought that was an April Fool's because a gigabyte of free email storage or
[02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:17.220]   something.
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:21.500]   But yeah, I mean, they should be ludicrous.
[02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:26.300]   And we should praise who did the most ludicrous over the top thing.
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:32.660]   For something that actually could be real, maybe at this time, it's just not appropriate
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.660]   anymore.
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:35.460]   It's just the damage can be too great.
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:38.060]   I would, Google put a hiatus on April Fool's.
[02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:42.340]   It was famous for its April Fool's for years, both last year and this year.
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:44.300]   Let's make that a permanent thing.
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:45.300]   Cool.
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:46.300]   You know what?
[02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:47.300]   They did pigeon rank.
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:48.300]   It was ludicrous.
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:49.300]   Yeah.
[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:50.300]   It was funny.
[02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:51.300]   It was obviously not true.
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:54.900]   But the toilet internet or, yeah, obviously not true.
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:56.380]   Yeah.
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:58.260]   But you know, really it's us.
[02:07:58.260 --> 02:08:03.140]   It's tech journalists who get burned the most by this because you can't open the paper
[02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:07.260]   on, you can't look at Tech meme on April 1st because you just don't know what's going
[02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:09.020]   to be real and what's not.
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:10.020]   Sometimes it's so subtle.
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:12.020]   We get emails, you know, Bloomberg.
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:14.860]   I'm sure at CNN, another place is too.
[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:19.580]   Like we get emails going out from our bureau chief saying it's April 1st.
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:21.140]   The extra vigil.
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:22.140]   You're afraid.
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:23.140]   Yeah.
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:28.100]   And in a day and age where you see people on Facebook and Twitter resharing onion articles
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.940]   as real, there's a real hazard to this.
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:37.140]   People don't necessarily have a sense of humor or any sense of any judgment about whether
[02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:38.380]   this is ridiculous.
[02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:39.380]   Like this story.
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:41.100]   I think this is ridiculous.
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:42.660]   You've all seen this picture.
[02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:47.340]   The famous meme, they call it disaster girl.
[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:49.540]   She was a four year old girl.
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:53.180]   The truth behind the story is actually it looks like she's looking at her house burning
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:58.900]   down and give you kind of an evil side glance like see what I did.
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:06.940]   In fact, the girl in this picture, Zoe Roth and her father, Dave Roth, went over to watch
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:08.620]   a house being burnt down.
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:14.540]   This was actually a fire department controlled burn on purpose.
[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:17.540]   He took this picture in 2005.
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:20.380]   Of course, immediately went viral.
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:25.340]   It is now an NFT, a non fungible token.
[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:31.020]   I thought we were done with NFTs to be honest with you, but disaster girl decided to sell
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:32.020]   her meme.
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.020]   She's now 21.
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:37.820]   She got half a million dollars.
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:39.260]   You don't own the picture.
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:43.060]   I mean, I guess you technically do.
[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:47.380]   They will get 10% of resale value, which is nice.
[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:51.020]   They maintain copyright, which is nice.
[02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:53.460]   They haven't really given anybody anything.
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:10:00.340]   She says she's going to pay off her college loans and then donate the rest of charity.
[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:05.460]   She's a student at UNC in Chapel Hill.
[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:08.180]   I think she should speak that money out of junk free.
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:09.180]   That's just me.
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:10.180]   Take it.
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:11.180]   Take the money.
[02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:12.180]   I'm sure I should.
[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:13.180]   Yeah.
[02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:14.180]   I have so many conflicted feelings.
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:17.140]   I think it's great that she was able to turn this into such a financial win.
[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:21.300]   That's fantastic, but may not still have so many queasy feelings about NFTs and the
[02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:23.300]   United States buying a URL.
[02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:24.300]   It's a good story.
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:25.300]   It's a good story.
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:26.300]   It's a good story.
[02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:28.220]   But if somebody's willing to spend half a million, it's on them.
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.300]   Good for you disaster girl.
[02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:36.420]   I think Star Wars kid is going to sell his, let's say, Perfidia.
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:41.220]   All these people who are in memes whose lives have been completely ruined by being a meme,
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:42.660]   they should get something for it.
[02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:43.660]   Absolutely they should.
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:45.660]   You can make a gamergate NFT.
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:46.660]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:47.660]   Oh, man.
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:50.620]   It will be the frog feature at large.
[02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:51.620]   Yeah.
[02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:52.620]   Exactly.
[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:53.620]   We'll do it.
[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:57.820]   No, but in all seriousness, I think the problem that I have with NFT, we all agree it's terrible
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:10:59.460]   for the environment.
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:04.300]   The problem I have with this, the underlying architecture of the protocol with it doesn't
[02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:05.300]   make sense.
[02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:12.500]   A lot of the people selling NFT, the way that it's coded is basically just pointing to a
[02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:13.500]   URL.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:14.500]   Right.
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:18.900]   Well, what happens if that URL for that video disappears, you can do it in such a way that
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:19.900]   it's more than making the way.
[02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:21.900]   You could use IPFS or something like that.
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:23.900]   Yeah, that's exactly.
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:27.580]   But it's not the reality of how many of these are being sold.
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:31.340]   So I think there need to be standards for this.
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:37.820]   And frankly, none of it's worth anything until there's some sort of legal copyright
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:42.020]   that the owners hold that is validated by the courts.
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:47.460]   So I'm very skeptical that these are going to have value in the future.
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:55.140]   But I also think it's true that because of the income inequality, there are a lot of
[02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:59.420]   people that have assets around and they're like, where do I put this?
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:01.420]   Where it could possibly make money?
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:05.100]   And it's like just a high risk bet for some people.
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:06.100]   Will it pay off?
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:08.500]   I don't think so, but maybe it will.
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:09.500]   Yeah.
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:12.540]   I can't wait to see this hit the courts.
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:15.580]   I'm completely with you, like, bringing.
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:21.940]   I'll be there with the popcorn with my feet up, just watching the madness unfold because
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:22.940]   I agree.
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:24.220]   It's a fad.
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:25.220]   It's ridiculous.
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:31.420]   But if someone wants to make half a million bucks selling a picture, my hat is off to
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:35.140]   except that it isn't because it's ridiculous and my hat will still have.
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:41.100]   As long as we're in the meme field, you remember Bat Kid, the kid in San Francisco who was
[02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:49.700]   dying of cancer and they organized this wonderful kind of event where he ran around as a Batman
[02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:57.100]   and he did also, he threw the first pitch at the Giants game and all sorts of things.
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:13:04.020]   He is healthy and thriving and now cancer free.
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:06.220]   So isn't that awesome?
[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:07.220]   That's amazing.
[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:08.220]   Yeah.
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:09.220]   That is wonderful.
[02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:11.580]   Thank you for passing that along, Rhett Con as long as we're talking memes, let's talk
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:12.580]   happy memes.
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:21.620]   An Oscar for Facebook, an Oculus, an electronic arts, Collette, a documentary short, the first
[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:22.620]   Oscar.
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:26.300]   Now, nobody watched the Oscars, so I'm not surprised if you didn't know this.
[02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:31.540]   At the lowest ratings in the history of the Academy Awards, which is, you know, it used
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:33.300]   to be a religious holiday in my household.
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:40.340]   We'd have parties, we'd have ballots, but having an Oscar ceremony in a train station
[02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:43.740]   with a DJ, it just felt like a bad wedding.
[02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:49.380]   And but anyway, a 25 minute film following former French resistance member Collette,
[02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:54.140]   Marin Catherine, as she travels to Germany for the first time in 74 years.
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:14:00.220]   It's a VR experience and it's the first, I think it's got to be the first Oscar for
[02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:02.500]   a virtual reality experience.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:08.380]   Boy, I mean, the world is changing for, you know, a couple of years ago, was at Spielberg
[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:13.620]   was saying you shouldn't ever be eligible just for a Oscar on a streaming film.
[02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:15.340]   Netflix won seven or what do they win?
[02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:17.300]   They won seven or eight Oscars.
[02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:20.140]   I think Spielberg's lost that one.
[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:25.500]   How much did Verizon pay for Yahoo and AOL?
[02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:27.420]   About nine billion dollars.
[02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:28.900]   How much are they going to get?
[02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:30.420]   They're selling it.
[02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:33.380]   They expect maybe four billion.
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:35.820]   Couldn't happen to a nicer company.
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:39.700]   I thought we could keep running it.
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:41.060]   Oh, it would fix it all.
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:42.060]   Right.
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:43.060]   Oh, I love to kick people in there down.
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:44.060]   Are you kidding?
[02:14:44.060 --> 02:14:45.340]   I shouldn't comment on this probably.
[02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:47.420]   Oh, you work for somebody.
[02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:48.500]   Are you going to be sold?
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.100]   Are you part of the scene?
[02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:51.100]   No, Verizon.
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:53.820]   Oh, no, we're we're happy and healthy at our home now.
[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:57.180]   No, yeah, I was I was part of the AO group for a good long while.
[02:14:57.180 --> 02:15:00.420]   Yeah, and again, so I, you know, of course, I've been friends over there and I hope that
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:01.420]   this will work well for them.
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:02.420]   Oh, that's right.
[02:15:02.420 --> 02:15:03.620]   So seen at his own by Red Ventures now, right?
[02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:05.300]   We run by Red Ventures, right?
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:07.500]   Yeah, I think they're going to be good for you.
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:08.500]   Honestly.
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:09.500]   They have been so far.
[02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:10.500]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:11.500]   Looking good.
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:14.100]   Tumbler, remember, bought Yahoo.
[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:19.780]   A rather Verizon bought Tumbler as part of Yahoo for 1.1 billion.
[02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:26.780]   Sold over WordPress for a penny and a half, I think it was well below 20 million.
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:30.780]   The Huffington Post, Verizon sold that to BuzzFeed.
[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:36.900]   I mean, it's just been it's a fire sale and could be fair.
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:40.740]   You know, the purchase of a what came with a lot of ad sale technology.
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:44.060]   And I'm sure I don't know what you think that you think whether that's just changing
[02:15:44.060 --> 02:15:45.060]   hands.
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:48.100]   So, you know, it may not be a one to one on what they bought versus what they're selling.
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:49.900]   So it's really easy to look at these things.
[02:15:49.900 --> 02:15:51.820]   Look at, oh, you know, they wrote this thing in the ground.
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:55.340]   Now they're selling it for pennies, but there may be some technology that that is being
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:59.220]   held and therefore, you know, the value is still within the company.
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:01.820]   But I don't know the details of this and I guess nobody knows.
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:03.020]   I saw it in the transaction.
[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:05.820]   And the Wall Street Journal article did say parts of.
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:10.500]   So that kind of confirms that it made some of the good stuff they may keep.
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:15.020]   On the other hand, the New York Police Department is not keeping their robot dog.
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:17.020]   Oh, God.
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:22.220]   They're returning it after critics seized on it as a dystopian example of overly aggressive
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:23.220]   policing.
[02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:24.220]   Yeah.
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:25.220]   Thank.
[02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:27.740]   I think this is another example of foremarketing.
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:30.420]   Like we were talking about Google Glass before how Google just threw it out there and ignored
[02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:31.420]   all the privacy concerns.
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:36.180]   If the NYPD had launched a series of commercials showing how the robot dog can go into a burning
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:40.580]   building and save, you know, keep people from having to go into dangerous situations, I
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:42.460]   think the reaction probably would have been pretty significant.
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:45.900]   Instead, there was that one picture of this dog or one video of the dog walking out of
[02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:49.020]   the department that nobody expected and everyone was freaking out because of it.
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:50.020]   Roughly so big.
[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:53.260]   Suddenly just showed up on the sidewalk and nobody knew where it came from.
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:54.260]   Look at the subtext.
[02:16:54.260 --> 02:16:55.260]   It would have been a little bit of marketing.
[02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:56.260]   It would have been a result.
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:17:00.820]   Doing it in a housing project, you know, maybe not the best.
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:03.740]   During like the Black Lives Matter protests, right?
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:10.540]   So if your response to something like that is, hi, let's bring out our surveillance technology
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:13.580]   that looks like a moto terminator.
[02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:19.220]   You know, that's just not, I feel, I'm not a PR professional.
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:21.540]   Maybe, maybe there are other things you could do.
[02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:23.620]   Yeah, totally agree.
[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:25.580]   Yeah.
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:28.620]   This is something I hadn't really, you know, there's so many things to worry about in the
[02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:29.620]   future.
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:32.180]   This is not one I had thought we would be worrying about.
[02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:38.620]   Geographers are warning deep fake satellite imagery poses a not so distant threat.
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:41.940]   This is according to James Vincent in the Verge.
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:46.060]   Geographic deep fakes.
[02:17:46.060 --> 02:17:50.740]   Nothing to say about that.
[02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:52.820]   I just thought I'd warn you.
[02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:54.380]   Is that where you put Tom's cruise house?
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:55.380]   Tom Cruise's house on top?
[02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:56.380]   Yeah, that's exactly.
[02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:58.380]   I'm going to do things.
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:00.580]   I don't see the problem with that.
[02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:06.900]   I'm going to do a deep fake, like a disco floor in your backyard layout.
[02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:08.500]   It's going to be out there forever.
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:09.500]   Nobody will believe it.
[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:10.780]   Nobody will believe it.
[02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:15.820]   Actually, I wouldn't mind a disco floor in my backyard as long as it had good ramps,
[02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:17.140]   truck ramps on it.
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:18.140]   So I don't know.
[02:18:18.140 --> 02:18:20.380]   I'm going to get those exposed wheels.
[02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:22.540]   Yeah, I'm going to get those.
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:24.220]   Ladies and gentlemen, you guys are wonderful.
[02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:27.260]   I thank you so much for being here.
[02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:34.940]   Oh, I didn't give Nate a chance to plug, but I didn't give Nate Langson a chance.
[02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:38.980]   Tell us about Bloomberg and especially about this new thing that you're doing.
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:40.580]   I think it's very...
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:41.580]   It's not that new.
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:43.580]   You've talked about it before, the Quick Take.
[02:18:43.580 --> 02:18:44.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:52.620]   I mean, I'm an editor at Bloomberg, so I cover a lot of the European tech scene.
[02:18:52.620 --> 02:19:01.180]   But I do a lot of video now for Quick Take, which is sort of our slightly more youth...
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:09.140]   I don't say youth-focused version of Bloomberg, but it's like if the rest of Bloomberg is markets
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:15.740]   and stocks, then Quick Take is for current events and is much broader in scope.
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:21.260]   And I do a lot of consumer tech stuff for that.
[02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:26.780]   I've done things like salmon farms up off the coast of the Orkney Islands in Scotland,
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:32.660]   getting equipped with 5G to monitor the health of...
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:33.660]   Sheep.
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:34.660]   Oh, salmon.
[02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:35.660]   Okay.
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:36.660]   Salmon.
[02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:39.940]   Yeah, so sailed out into the North Sea for that one.
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:40.940]   Wow.
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:42.220]   Lots of other stuff.
[02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:47.300]   So it's a big part of what I do, and then on the side of that I do my podcast.
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:50.380]   Text message, which is great.
[02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:53.940]   Webby award, shortlisted technology podcast.
[02:19:53.940 --> 02:19:54.940]   And you know what?
[02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:56.300]   We lost to you, Leo, that year.
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.300]   I know.
[02:19:57.300 --> 02:19:58.300]   We lost.
[02:19:58.300 --> 02:19:59.300]   We were down to...
[02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:02.660]   You think I don't know that, Nate?
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:03.660]   I know.
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:07.340]   You think I don't run around with that trophy every day?
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:08.660]   He said, "Beam, beat 'em!"
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:09.660]   No, I don't.
[02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:11.860]   Hey, they still sent me a frame certificate.
[02:20:11.860 --> 02:20:13.940]   I've got it up there in the corner of the sea.
[02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:17.420]   Look, all you missed out was a metal spring.
[02:20:17.420 --> 02:20:18.420]   That's what the movie...
[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:19.420]   That's what the trip came to.
[02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:20.980]   Is that what it was?
[02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:26.460]   And I think that we lost in the vote, but the people's choice brought us back or something.
[02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:29.860]   I can't remember exactly how that happened, but it's a great podcast.
[02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:32.260]   How long have you been doing it?
[02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:33.260]   About six years.
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:36.380]   I started it when I left Wired, because I ran the Wired podcast.
[02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:37.380]   I started that at Wired.
[02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:38.620]   Did a couple of hundred episodes.
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:43.460]   And when I moved to Bloomberg, I thought I was going to do so much more on the core business
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:48.900]   and finance that I would do less on the consumer and irreverence that I like.
[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:54.900]   I like entertaining people with tech news, as well as being informed about it.
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:58.340]   So I started it when I joined, and I've just kept doing it ever since.
[02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:01.580]   We've done 230-suming episodes.
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:05.380]   And we copied you, because you're doing with extra message pretty much the same thing.
[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:08.620]   The ad-free version, the Discord, and all that.
[02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:10.660]   Are using Patreon or memberful?
[02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:12.100]   What are you using?
[02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:16.940]   We use Patreon, and we've been doing that now for about four years.
[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:21.260]   I took a lot of inspiration from, basically Tom Merritt, a daily technician.
[02:21:21.260 --> 02:21:22.740]   Dtns does that.
[02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:23.740]   Yep.
[02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:24.740]   Yeah.
[02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:26.740]   Ex of your parish, of course.
[02:21:26.740 --> 02:21:32.060]   He was very helpful and gave me a lot of good pointers when we started up.
[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:34.820]   But yeah, that's sort of gone to have his life of its own now.
[02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:35.820]   So that's...
[02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:36.820]   Yeah.
[02:21:36.820 --> 02:21:41.700]   Yeah, we're really having a lot of fun with the club Twitter.
[02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:45.780]   What's great is building a community is so much fun, and we have a great community,
[02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:48.060]   but we just haven't had good ways to kind of interact with them.
[02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:51.740]   So it's really, really nice to do that.
[02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:53.220]   Thank you so much for being here, Nate.
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:56.300]   I know it's late, like the middle of the night.
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:58.020]   Thank you for staying up with us.
[02:21:58.020 --> 02:22:00.740]   It's 1am, but it's my pleasure.
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:02.140]   We really love having you on.
[02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:03.300]   You're great.
[02:22:03.300 --> 02:22:05.820]   And for you, Tim Stevens, it's been too long.
[02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:08.740]   We'll get you back real soon, editor-in-chief at Roadshow.
[02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:09.740]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:10.740]   Asina.
[02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:16.300]   And of course, it's the wonderful Brianna Wu, rebellionpack.com, if you want to find
[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:17.620]   out what she's up to.
[02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:19.660]   And there, will you make an announcement sometime?
[02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:20.660]   It's a rocket.
[02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:21.660]   And rocket.
[02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:22.660]   Don't forget, Relay and Pham.
[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:26.100]   Relay no awards, no heavy awards, the perfect nomination.
[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:31.940]   It is the Relay's best-worst show, but we like it.
[02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:32.940]   Oh.
[02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:39.460]   Easily, well, I don't want to say because I have lots of friends on Relay.fm, but I really
[02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:43.260]   love Simonda Rush 4, Christina Warren and Brianna Wu.
[02:22:43.260 --> 02:22:46.220]   That is a panel to die for.
[02:22:46.220 --> 02:22:47.740]   It's just great.
[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:48.940]   They also have a membership.
[02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:53.300]   So find out more, Relay.fm/rocket.
[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:54.300]   Rocket.
[02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:58.700]   Last latest episode, Triple Scam Town.
[02:22:58.700 --> 02:23:00.500]   Oh, that was good.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:01.980]   We love covering scams.
[02:23:01.980 --> 02:23:03.420]   That's our beat.
[02:23:03.420 --> 02:23:06.180]   Like when people, there was three scams that week.
[02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:08.020]   So it was like a three alarm fire.
[02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:12.780]   You talked also about the ice cream, the McDonald's ice cream machine story.
[02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:14.780]   That is a fascinating story.
[02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:15.860]   That's a scam.
[02:23:15.860 --> 02:23:17.380]   That is a scam, in my opinion.
[02:23:17.380 --> 02:23:18.380]   Yeah.
[02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:19.380]   What is it?
[02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:20.380]   Taylor that makes those machines.
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:21.380]   Taylor, yep.
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:22.380]   Yep.
[02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:26.420]   And the things are so hideously complex that they're almost always broken.
[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:32.060]   Much so that somebody wrote a bot to try to order a MacFlurry at every McDonald's in
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:33.060]   the country.
[02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:37.660]   And then it's an updated live update map of which MacFlurry machines are down.
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:44.620]   But then another couple created a Raspberry Pi device that would make these things much
[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:45.620]   more reliable.
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:49.940]   They were trying to do a frozen yogurt bot.
[02:23:49.940 --> 02:23:53.500]   And Taylor completely came down.
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:55.420]   They hired a PI.
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:57.500]   I mean, it's a fascinating story.
[02:23:57.500 --> 02:23:58.900]   So that's a good episode to listen to.
[02:23:58.900 --> 02:24:04.260]   The reason they qualified for Scamtown is the fact that they deliberately make the
[02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:11.140]   UI so unreadable by the people that work at McDonald's that they end up having to fall
[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:17.660]   back on basically bringing in the text from Taylor, which are very, very expensive.
[02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:25.220]   And it's actually the revenue from their maintenance part of their company is 25% of
[02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:26.220]   their bottom lines.
[02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:33.860]   And this alliance between McDonald's where they're like, you can only use this one machine
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:36.420]   if you want to be a franchise owner.
[02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:41.380]   And then the company that makes the machine has a financial interest in having it basically
[02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:42.700]   always broke it.
[02:24:42.700 --> 02:24:49.500]   So don't get angry at McDonald's if you can't get your Oreo MacFlurry like an angry at Taylor.
[02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:52.740]   Great article in Wired a couple of weeks ago by Andy Greenberg about the couple that
[02:24:52.740 --> 02:24:56.860]   hacked McDonald's ice cream machines and started a cold war highly recommended.
[02:24:56.860 --> 02:25:00.700]   And of course, rocket at relay.fm.
[02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:07.340]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon right about I'd say about 230 Pacific five 30 Eastern
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:09.020]   time 21 30 UTC.
[02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:13.820]   You can watch us do it live at twit.tv/live.
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:17.100]   If you're doing that, if you're watching or listening live, please join us in the chat
[02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:22.500]   room at irc.twit.tv club twit members can also listen live inside our discord channel
[02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:26.220]   and we've got a chat room going there as well.
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:29.300]   Here's the link to the is McDonald's ice cream machine broken.
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:32.020]   It's mikbroken.com by the way.
[02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:33.020]   Thank you, Matt Ryder.
[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:38.660]   I get out of curiosity before I go on.
[02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:43.660]   Let's just see how many of those ice cream 9% are currently broken.
[02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:52.340]   Of course, if you're in New York, 22.5% are currently broken here in Northern California.
[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:55.380]   Looks like about half of them are non functional.
[02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:58.500]   That's crazy.
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:25:59.940]   This is brilliant.
[02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:02.660]   This is what this is what tech was invented for.
[02:26:02.660 --> 02:26:04.900]   IRC that twit.tv discord.
[02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:05.900]   Let's see club twit.
[02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:06.900]   What else was I saying?
[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:09.540]   Oh, you can download copies of the show after the fact.
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:11.820]   We of course, it's a podcast.
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:14.700]   We put them all on the website at twit.tv.
[02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:18.900]   If you get to there, you could also check out our YouTube channel.
[02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:24.140]   The shows are there and subscribe and your favorite podcast player.
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:26.620]   That way you'll get it automatically as soon as it's available.
[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:32.020]   It's Sunday evening just in time for your Monday morning commute.
[02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:34.460]   After the fact, we have a number of ways we can interact.
[02:26:34.460 --> 02:26:39.620]   Of course, we've got a wonderful twit community at twit.community.
[02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:41.260]   There's also a mastodon instance.
[02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:45.340]   If you like the Fediverse, it's a Twitter clone on mastodon.
[02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:47.540]   That's at twit.social.
[02:26:47.540 --> 02:26:50.980]   And a lot of activity going on now in club twit.
[02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:56.420]   If you want to know more about joining the club, it's twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:26:56.420 --> 02:26:59.580]   Thanks so much everybody for being here.
[02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:00.580]   And we'll see you next time.
[02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:01.580]   Another twit.
[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:02.580]   This is the Cazzy.
