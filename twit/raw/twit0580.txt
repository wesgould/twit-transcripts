[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.160]   Yes, we have a jet black one.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.360]   Explain what happened to the headphone port
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.600]   and what they could in place.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.240]   The answer may surprise you.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.040]   We'll also talk about why Congress might need
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.920]   to act pretty quickly to keep the FBI
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.640]   from snooping into your computer.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.960]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   to show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.280]   I am Leo LaPorte.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.280]   We've assembled a lovely panel here.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.440]   This is my getaway day.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   I'm going on vacation right after this show.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.960]   So everybody agreed to start a little bit early
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.120]   so I can get to the airplane.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.480]   Look who's in studio.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.880]   I'm really thrilled.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880]   An old friend, Phil Limbin is here.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.360]   Phil is, you probably remember his name
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.840]   as the CEO of Evernote.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.760]   And now as a venture capitalist.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.480]   So because you no longer work for Evernote,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.920]   you can be on the show.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.560]   You actually wanted to be on the show.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.840]   I did.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.960]   You were maybe the first person I met
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.760]   when I moved to Silicon Valley about 10 years ago.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.600]   Really?
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.440]   Oh nice.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.280]   And a lifelong dream of mine.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.040]   Where did you come from?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.800]   Boy, that's a long story.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.040]   I think you're Russian, right?
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.960]   Was born in Russia.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.880]   In St. Petersburg.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.720]   Moved to--
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   I'm going down town.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.520]   Tell him I fell on that high.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.200]   I do not.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.040]   No.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.240]   Because you were a little baby.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.080]   I was eight.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.920]   I was eight.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.760]   I was kind of a big baby.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.600]   Good way to remember it.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.440]   I remember, yeah.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.280]   I remember pretty well.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.120]   But it was a long time ago.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.960]   I'm still in New York.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.280]   I grew up there.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.080]   Yeah, so what's interesting is your accent
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.760]   is this mix of Russian and New York.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.080]   It's awesome.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.360]   I grew up in the Bronx.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.840]   It's probably one of the Bronx accents.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.600]   Yeah, you're the Bronx.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.160]   That's nice.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.920]   And then "Ever Note" was when?
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.720]   10 years ago?
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.400]   Yeah, 2007 came out to California forever, no 2007.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.200]   I remember when I first started using it before you
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.520]   were part of it, it was a couple of Russian brothers,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.880]   were they?
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.480]   Something like that.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   Couple of Russian guys.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.840]   So there was two precursor companies to ever know.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.880]   There was a team here, started by Stepan Pajikov,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.040]   who was in a very eccentric, brilliant Russian-American
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.880]   scientist, engineer guy.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   And he actually had the original team out of the Apple
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.800]   Newton.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.160]   These were the guys who did a handwriting mission
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.280]   for the Apple Newton.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.240]   Because they were trying to do it was like a grocery tape,
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.320]   kind of continuous roll.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.880]   We called it like--
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.840]   It was before one note.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.120]   Yeah, we called it the toilet paper interface.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.800]   It was just like a big roll, toilet paper
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.840]   that you could just write on.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.720]   And it was super cool.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.800]   And then I had a team in Boston.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.240]   We started working on a very similar idea.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.280]   Got together, kind of recreated the company.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.200]   So the modern never know, came around in 2007.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.920]   And you left the company just here to go.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.760]   A little over a year ago?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.600]   And I became a VC during the dark side.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.880]   Are you still on the board or associated with him in any way?
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.800]   I stepped down from the board yesterday.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.320]   What?
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.600]   Very recently.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.200]   Wow.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   OK.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.600]   It's been struggling, but I root for it.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.120]   I really love Evernote.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.760]   I loved it when I first used it.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.240]   And I think I have more data stored in Evernote.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.840]   And I keep looking at other options and nothing suits.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.680]   I use it multiple times a day every day.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.960]   You kind of live in it.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.200]   I'm really proud of what we built.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.520]   I think it happens.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.320]   But I think part of the problem is it's freemium.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.240]   And the conversion rate is low of people to the paid version.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.200]   So it's--
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.600]   I don't want to officially speak for the company anymore.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.120]   You don't.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.840]   So that's why I'm asking you now.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.320]   I think it never tell me before.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.880]   I think it's actually doing really well.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.400]   I think numbers are all good.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.920]   You know, it's--
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.720]   They raised the price a little bit.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.600]   Well, they raised the price.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   And in some countries, they lowered it in other countries.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.200]   Basically, just repriced it.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.000]   That bothered some people, though.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.560]   I'm sure it bothered a lot of people.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.440]   But I think it's worth it.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.720]   It's worth eight bucks a month to me.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.440]   I think it's a fair price for what you get out of it.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.560]   Also joining us to your left--
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.440]   one of my favorite people, who I've never met,
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.040]   Georgia Dow of iMore.com.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.400]   Hi, Georgia.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.160]   Hey, Leo.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.080]   She's borrowing Johnny Ives' white room once again.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.920]   Yes, yes.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.200]   I haven't set up my back area.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.760]   I will at some point have it set up.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.800]   I've been really interested because I'm wondering--
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.480]   the reason you were in this new area
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.280]   is you gave your husband your old studio for his VIVE room.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.040]   Yes.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.000]   How is he-- now, OK.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.160]   Here we are several months later, still using it.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.360]   Yeah, we both still absolutely love it.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.720]   We have bean bags that we move out of the room
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.440]   so we can play some of the newest games on the VIVE.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.080]   We have Oculus also downstairs, which
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.720]   will probably move upstairs as well.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.760]   And so, yeah, I still have the white ball.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.480]   I love it.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.920]   OK.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   I love it.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.960]   I love it.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.480]   I just got a little selfie off of this.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.680]   I feel like I'm from the-- did you?
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.840]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.080]   So OK, I have another question because as soon
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.160]   as I put the anniversary update on Windows 10
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.800]   on my ultimate virtual reality gaming
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.880]   or, actually, the VIVE started crashing every time.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.480]   So is it working OK with Windows 10
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   and the anniversary update for you guys?
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.040]   So it must just be--
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.080]   It's just me.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.120]   Yeah, for me.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.620]   OK.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.160]   I don't know how you have it set up,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.920]   but were you--
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   maybe just for you.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.680]   It's the Nvidia car driver.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.280]   And I haven't had time to sit down and really do it.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.000]   At first, in fact, I haven't even checked lately.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.320]   Because I thought, now, they'll just update the driver
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.760]   eventually and it'll work.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.640]   It was one of the many things that stopped working
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.200]   with the anniversary update of Windows 10.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.360]   It's been about an hour and job simulator the other day.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.040]   And it was pretty fulfilling.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.440]   No, it's weird.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   It's great.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   You're out to your butt.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.800]   You can staple things, throw stuff over the cubicle wall.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.720]   It was uncannily accurate representation.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.760]   Of day-to-day life.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.560]   That's pretty much my day life.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.680]   It's why he had to leave Evernote.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.400]   Too much of truth comes out.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.440]   It's a good one later.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.280]   Also with--
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.440]   I love Quiver as well, which is a great game
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.440]   if you haven't already tried it.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.920]   What's Quiver?
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.600]   I haven't.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.760]   It's an archery game where you're defending a keep.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.120]   It's still in alpha mode, but it's a fabulous game.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.760]   And I think I play it--
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.920]   like every time I play the vibe, I will at least once
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.600]   play Quiver with VR.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.640]   Well, let me introduce Larry, and then I'll continue.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.200]   Because I want to talk to you about the VR.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.520]   Larry Maggot is also here from CBS Radio News
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.840]   and connect safely.org and safekids.com.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.520]   And it's always a pleasure to have you in here, too.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.840]   Always a pleasure, yeah.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.880]   My good buddy.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.080]   And you said you couldn't come today
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.720]   because your media group is meeting.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.960]   Our media group is meeting.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.480]   It's not a book.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.320]   We talk about a group.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:12.680]   No, no.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.080]   It is a book and movie group.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.080]   So we talk--
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.160]   tonight's subject is an entry in "Canonade."
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.560]   So we had to read the book and watch both movies.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.240]   And I thoroughly-- the book was good,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.720]   although I have to admit I'm not completely done with the book.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.760]   I fell asleep at one point.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.000]   Not because of the book of the boring,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.920]   but I always fall asleep when I read.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.760]   I read it on an airplane last night from New York
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.800]   and I was exhausted.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.640]   But I love the Frank Sinatra.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.080]   The old movie, the original movie is phenomenal.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.800]   And the newer one, "Denzo Washington," is always great,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.400]   but the movie is not that good.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.080]   Classic.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.560]   Have you done "The Martian" yet?
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.040]   Oh.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.560]   No.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:43.920]   Not yet.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.720]   So does it always have to be a movie book tie-in?
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.680]   I don't know.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.160]   This movie-- the media club is only about two media club
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.360]   events old.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.000]   I don't think that's a bad idea, though, for a book.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.800]   It's a pretty good idea.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.240]   It's a pretty good idea.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.360]   And my wife is actually getting mentoring food
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.040]   for dinner tonight.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.440]   So we're going to--
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.280]   That's hot pot.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   No, it's hot pot, right?
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.680]   You've been--
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.680]   It's going to be good, whatever it is.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.120]   So I was going to ask about VR.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.920]   I'll ask both you Phil and Georgia,
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.520]   although maybe Larry, you've been using it too.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:12.840]   I don't know.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.520]   I'm tired of it.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.080]   I'm over it.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.160]   It's like 3D for TVs to me.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.760]   It's just like, OK, did it.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.920]   I'm not going to live in it.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.160]   It's fun once in a while.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.400]   You're not sick of it?
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:24.960]   I'm not at all.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.240]   No.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.160]   For me, it's immersive.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.320]   I love the immersion.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.880]   I enjoy gaming anyways.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.480]   But to be able to game when you're actually exercising
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.240]   and working out, ducking behind things,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.680]   the wonderful thing is I can use my martial art training.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.720]   And I actually feel like now it's a real use.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.240]   I can actually fight things.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.000]   No, wait a minute.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so--
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.880]   No, you're not fighting anything.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.040]   You're looking like a dork with a toaster on your forehead
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.840]   and nunchucks in your hand going like this.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.320]   But in my mind, in my mind.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.840]   OK.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.680]   But if you look like a dork in the forest,
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.120]   and no one's there to see you,
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.120]   you're looking like a dork.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.200]   Really look like a dork.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   That's not what's stopping.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.000]   I just don't want to wear that headset for more than a little
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.600]   bit at a time.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.040]   I didn't crash into anything yet.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.200]   With a vibe, at least with H.E.C.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   I think they have a room.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.920]   They have a boundary.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.760]   They put you around.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.680]   Yeah, you can see when you get too close to the edge
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.640]   of your space, the little green lines.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.320]   But if you use the Samsung VR where you're only tethered
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   to your phone, which may be--
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:19.920]   Or you can walk into anything.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.760]   --pocket, you can walk into anything or off a cliff.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.040]   And I wouldn't say I'm completely tired of it,
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.360]   but I don't find it that compelling.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.840]   Maybe it's my age.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.440]   I'm not a big gamer.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.560]   But I have one problem.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.840]   So you know the New York Times?
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.720]   They had this-- it's an app.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.280]   And you can get it on-- in fact, they gave away
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.360]   the cardboard of VR.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.240]   So I'm watching this really compelling video.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.120]   And I actually am enjoying it.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.080]   Now you're doing it for--
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:44.800]   Were you watching this?
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.080]   I'm not enjoying it, but I'm appreciating it.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.120]   No, it's amazing.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.400]   And all of a sudden, I hear this plane,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.680]   and it's dropping supplies, I think, in this sedan.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.120]   But I don't see the plane.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.080]   Because in the real world, if a plane
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.320]   were flying over me, I would actually
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.720]   know it was over me, because I could hear it
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.120]   was over me.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.080]   I'd look up to it.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.920]   But I couldn't figure out where this plane was.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.120]   And I actually missed the important scene.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.680]   And I realized that in a movie, a director
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.720]   goes out of his or her way to make sure you're
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.520]   looking at the important thing that you should be paying
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.560]   attention to.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.320]   In virtual reality, it's up to you to know where to look.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.480]   And I think it works well in some environments.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.160]   But for movie type presentations,
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.760]   I actually felt myself not getting the full value out of it.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.320]   You have to tune it for the--
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.840]   you're right.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.440]   I mean, you have to tune it for the experience.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.880]   That's why gaming, I think, works well, as opposed
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.960]   to storytelling.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.400]   I think storytelling's going to be great.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.800]   It's just people haven't really figured out how to do it.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.960]   You have to get the audio right.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.800]   They have to figure out through it.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.640]   Well, that's another problem.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.960]   None of these do the audio right.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.840]   None of them move the audio in the same way they move the picture.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.800]   I think I've seen some with very good positional audio.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.880]   And look, it's just all of the first movies
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.800]   when films first came out.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.040]   So we're all just basically people filming plays.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.000]   And it took a long time.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.320]   It took decades for people to figure out
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.480]   how to actually tell a story.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.720]   And television with you with the radio with pictures.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.080]   It'll take a few years.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.920]   But I think it's going to be pretty amazing.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.840]   I mean, I can tell when the experiences have been getting
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.640]   better exponentially.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.840]   And I can see greatness to it.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.240]   I would say it's already great, but it's not yet good.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:16.920]   So I can see--
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.280]   How do you get to great without going through good?
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.280]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.080]   I actually think most of the really important things
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.600]   skip good.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   They go directly to great.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.640]   And then it takes a few years to work backwards to good.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.520]   To make it actually file off all the rough edges.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.720]   I'm willing to withhold judgment.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.360]   I just feel like they were so much hype.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.480]   And I fell for it as well and spent a lot of money and time
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.200]   doing it.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.520]   And then I have this gnawing suspicion
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.000]   that might be just a fad.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.960]   You see, I don't think it's going to be a fad,
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.880]   because I've had, I think, everyone that I know try it out.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.000]   And these are people that usually that don't game.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.440]   And I think that it's really good at certain things.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.320]   So when you're playing first-person shooters
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.360]   against other people, it's a wonderful experience.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.480]   It's much more salacious when you shoot someone,
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.360]   and you're actually ducking behind something
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.360]   and running towards them.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.240]   Well, I have been punched a couple of times
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.400]   when my child's playing it.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.560]   And I have hit the wall and broke my Vive controller once
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   as well.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.680]   But it's a really immersive experience
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   to that.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680]   I think that it's different.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.040]   There's a certain things that would be good for.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.680]   I think that watching a horror film in VR
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.960]   might be too intense.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.680]   But from people that want that level of intensity,
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.360]   the fact that you might miss something
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.960]   and you're constantly looking around your shoulder,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.200]   I think, would add to the experience to it.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.000]   But again, it's just first gen.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.760]   Anybody have any updates on the porn?
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.560]   I know the porn hub or one of these sites is--
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.200]   I got tired of that, too.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.720]   I haven't checked it out.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   Now, I actually have it.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.640]   I'm not saying I wouldn't.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.200]   I just haven't.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.040]   I've checked it out.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.240]   I got tired of that, too.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.600]   I mean, did it add any dimension to it?
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.520]   That's pretty immersive.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.360]   Well, that's what porn ought to be about, I guess.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.280]   I know, no.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.440]   I don't think so.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.080]   Well, I may be not.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.320]   Maybe not.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.800]   Yeah, and maybe this is another case
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.360]   where they'll get better at it because we don't yet
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.480]   know how to do it properly.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.360]   Aren't they usually the early adopters?
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.080]   I mean, the old thing with VHF.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.920]   First of all, not sure.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.400]   That's true.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.320]   I think that that's a common misnomer, or misstatement.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.480]   But here's my problem.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.520]   I think VR, in general, demos great.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.280]   And people get very excited when they first do it.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.800]   It's really exciting.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.280]   I'm just not clear that it has a long-term appeal to it.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.640]   For a number of reasons, it makes people
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.720]   queasy as a big one.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.880]   And about 10% of everybody is going to stay queasy.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.360]   But also, it's--
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.080]   I don't know.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.600]   Maybe I feel the same way about video games.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.000]   So maybe I get tired of it after a while.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.080]   It's also kind of a big McGillia to get to do it.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.240]   I mean, if I want to watch TV--
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:48.760]   It's a big McGillia.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.560]   I turn on the TV, and it's right there, right?
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.060]   Nice.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.560]   Come on.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.400]   If I want to do VR, it's kind of like playing soccer.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.560]   I've got to buy a new computer.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.600]   You've got to buy a new computer.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.640]   That's why it would be interesting.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.320]   Sony's going to come out with this PlayStation VR
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.000]   in a couple of months.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.480]   And that will be a lot easier.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.400]   That's really nice.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   It's really nice.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.440]   It's really nice.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.480]   The PlayStation VR is fabulous.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.600]   That's a great--
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.160]   I was really surprised with how good PlayStation VR was.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.120]   When I tested it out, I tested out it on Heist,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.920]   which I think is Leo the same game that he tried with it.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.360]   It was great.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.880]   Yeah, you're riding in a car.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.800]   Jason Statham's driving.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.040]   You're worried about Chechen terrorists on motorcycles.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.200]   You have to shoot at their tires.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.320]   That one?
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.800]   It was amazing.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.000]   It was much faster to set up.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.240]   It was easier to use.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.720]   I think that--
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.480]   and the screen, it was really exceptionally good.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.440]   I think that this is something--
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.280]   it's more exhausting.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.960]   If you want a very passive experience,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.520]   virtual reality is not that.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.000]   It's very, very immersive.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.280]   It's a little bit exhausting.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.360]   It's tiring.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.920]   I think that for the younger generation,
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.440]   they're often looking for that.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.760]   They want something that will be more immersive than just
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.520]   a game that you're looking on a screen.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.360]   And so I definitely increases my anxiety faster.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.000]   It makes me feel like I'm there.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.760]   I think that if you're looking for something
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.480]   that you can relax and do, I think that virtual reality is not
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.640]   that by its reach.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.120]   I think you really solved it for me,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.480]   because by the time I'm ready to play a game,
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.080]   I'm sitting there on the couch with a beer,
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.520]   wedging out.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.640]   And so maybe that--
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.640]   I think that's actually a very good understanding of it.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.160]   Thank you.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.760]   Now I know why.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.240]   Partly this is an occupational hazard,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.960]   because part of my job is to look at any new thing
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.920]   and say, well, is this really genuinely life-changing
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.760]   or technology-changing?
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.760]   Or is it just-- because let's face it, Silicon Valley's
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.560]   thrown a lot of stuff up against the wall,
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.160]   and most of it isn't.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.200]   But you can tell early.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   This is nothing like 3DVs.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   You think this is a big deal?
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.560]   Yeah, it's a big deal.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   And the negatives--
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   And these things-- I don't believe it.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   The problems that you guys are pointing out about them
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.840]   are kind of funny.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.080]   Like it takes too long to set up.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.880]   Well, it's expensive.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.440]   We had to build a multi-thousand dollar PC to do it.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.240]   Well, that'll change.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.000]   Boy, you know, this reminds me of a conversation
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.920]   that I was having about 100,000 years ago,
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.520]   when Fire first came out.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.680]   We were sitting in a cave.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.560]   Oh, man, you got to gather wood.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.160]   I know.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.280]   And it's like--
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.280]   I just don't see the big deal.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.560]   And it's like--
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.560]   It's hot.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   It burns you.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   It burns you.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   But you can hurt yourself.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.120]   Are you saying, Phil, that this is equivalent
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.680]   to the invention of fire?
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.920]   Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.920]   OK.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   Well--
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   You should see.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   It's virtual fire.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.360]   I think it's a big step forward.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.800]   It's everything is kind of clunky right now,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.360]   but it has the seeds of greatness in it.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   I understand that.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.720]   In a way, that 3DTV never did.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.720]   Like 3DTV was--
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   What about August?
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.720]   That was just a gimmick.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.880]   What about virtual orthogmented?
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.280]   Well, I think-- to me, augmented is really
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   going to be the revolution.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.160]   But at least I want to ask George's,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.400]   because you've been using it now for six months.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.200]   You and your own are very hot on it.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.520]   And if anybody was going to get tired of it, it would be you.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.440]   You're early.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.760]   It don't just, but you've spent a lot of time.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.600]   And you still love it.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.440]   So that, in a way, that's a data point that's valuable to me.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.880]   I've always said-- and by the way,
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.000]   Tim Cook this week said it as well.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.960]   He said, Apple's much more interested in augmented reality
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.480]   than virtual reality.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.920]   I think those are really totally different things.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.080]   I think VR is really entertainment.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.320]   And it's meant to be immersive.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.160]   It's meant to be entertainment.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.000]   And that's what Tim said is you can't see what's going on.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.720]   You're just in this world of your own.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.280]   And you don't want to.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.600]   You're sad and depressed after when
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.080]   you go back to your regular world.

[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   Yeah, Facebook.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   She's a lying, lying black cylinder.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   She's not answering.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.880]   She's not answering.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.880]   Yeah, I think you're not.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.880]   No, it's public knowledge.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.880]   I'm not hiding it.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   No, anyway.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.880]   When did I become a senior 59?
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.880]   I got my A or P card when I was 50, but I felt outed at the time.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   I thought that was horrible.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.440]   But anyway, we decided, you know, that we'd look at the other side of the age spectrum
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.400]   and give advice for seniors.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.080]   It's actually pretty much the same advice we give to kids, ironically, or not surprisingly,
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.000]   I suppose, you know, strong passwords and watch out for scams if the IRS calls.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   It's really not the IRS.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.080]   Oh, man, that is a big problem right now.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.080]   Lots of people getting IRS calls.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.080]   People fall for that.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   Obviously the phishing.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   But the interesting part, I get a little research in this year, we're looking at it right
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.160]   now, meeting new friends and romantic partners.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:48.880]   A lot of seniors date online and they're likely, more likely, I think, than younger
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.360]   people to get scammed by somebody who is younger or appears to be younger, probably not even
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.960]   the same gender or anything.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.160]   But there's all these dating scams out there that seniors have fallen for.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   So we did this.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.000]   You can get in the Connect Safely.org.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.480]   There's a link to it at the front page.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.080]   And if you're, it's also good if you're caring.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.480]   Like I have a 94-year-old mother-in-law who I care for.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.920]   I mean, I don't physically care for her, but I manage her finances and handle things for
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.920]   her.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.800]   And it's good advice for people in that situation as well.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:23.040]   I think a lot of us are supporting parents who are in the tech world and need a little
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.040]   bit of help.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040]   I got that.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.040]   Actually, wait a minute.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   I have a call coming in.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.960]   Hold on a second.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   Can you hear the audio from my phone, Carson?
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.120]   And the purpose of this call is-
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.560]   Hey, let me start it over again because I want to make sure that-
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.880]   I think it's an important call.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.240]   This call is officially a final notice from the IRS.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:47.560]   The nature and the purpose of this call is to inform you that we have received legal
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.720]   petition notice concerning attacks fraud against you.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   Oh, no.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.720]   That's one of the-
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   That's one of the-
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.720]   This is Joanne Stern running our call in the Wall Street Journal in June about robo-call
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.520]   complaints in the first half of the year.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.640]   Look at the growth, one and a half million almost complaints to the FTC this year.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.600]   And that's people complaining.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.680]   And what's great is she supplied some audio examples of robo-call.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   Here's one.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.360]   Hello, this is Rachel at Cardholder Services calling in reference to your card credit card
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   account.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   Hi, Rachel.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   I'm currently with you right now.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   Oh, thank you, bye.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   Rachel, but Rachel seemed so nice.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   She liked Rachel.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.360]   She liked Rachel.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   Yeah, I'd buy something.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.360]   Why do people still answer their phones?
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.360]   I know.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.360]   I know.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   Some people have to.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   I agree with you.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   I mean, I haven't answered my phone in years because most of the calls are like this.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   Hi, this is Josh from the customer service department.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   Can you hear me okay?
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   No, Josh, I can't hear a thing.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.560]   Okay, great.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.800]   You have been pre-selected to receive a vacation of one of our all-inclusive promotions, which
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.000]   includes Disney tickets for free.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.600]   It covers all your accommodations and all your food and drinks for up to two guests.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.000]   I like how they pretend this is a real good.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.400]   I know you're going to have a lot of questions.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   That sounds horrible.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.000]   So I go over a couple of highlights first, which is value $100.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   There's one.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The crew.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   The crew.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   I got that.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   That's how you got your trip that you got.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   That's how I got my trip, right?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   I'm excited.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   We're going to.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   I can't wait.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   They said they'd be waiting at the dock.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   On a bet.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Those tickets will be waiting for us at the dock.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   But seriously, if you don't know who's calling, why would you answer your phone?
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.600]   Well, sometimes you have to.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.480]   Well, one of the scams is that they spoof your area code, right?
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.480]   Right.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:30.160]   So a lot of people would get calls from clients or schools or where they may not recognize
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.360]   a number, but they say, "Well, it's a local number."
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   That can't be a scammer.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   It is.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   I was driving the other day.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.920]   We were driving the Niners' game on Monday, and I got a call, "Hello, this is Josh calling
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.760]   from Microsoft.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.400]   You are infected.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.720]   We see a lot of activity coming from your computer.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.800]   Are you in front of your computer right now?"
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.840]   I could have messed with him, but I just said, "Shame on you.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.120]   You should be ashamed.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.800]   What would your mother say if she knew you were calling people and scamming them and
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   he hung up on me?"
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.600]   But I thought, if everybody did that, maybe he'd feel really guilty.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.800]   I actually had a conversation with a guy who did that and was in the Philippines and he
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.520]   said, "Well, can you give me a job?"
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.800]   I said, "Look, I'm pretty tech savvy.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   I'm in Silicon Valley."
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   So that's the thing.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   That's why I don't judge them.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   I don't judge them.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   They're out of work.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   They're trying to hold their family together, and so I understand that.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   Right.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   But don't fall for it.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   Right.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.120]   Unfortunately, most of the people that watch your show wouldn't be one of the people that
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.280]   would fall for that.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:36.160]   But for my mom or a lot of people, they're not that tech savvy and they're really scary
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.280]   and very forceful when they're calling you out.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.200]   It sounds very official.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   We need to be talking about that.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   That's great.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.780]   I wonder if we say in the guide, "Don't feel bad if it happens to you because smart people
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:48.780]   are not tech savvy."
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.120]   The other thing we would point out, by the way, is that just because somebody's old doesn't
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.520]   mean they're not tech savvy.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.300]   So for example, I got a call from this company that had a cell phone that was easy enough
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.300]   for seniors to operate.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.880]   And I said, "Who do you think invented the cell phone?"
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.920]   I mean, you think it was invented by people who are now really old.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.520]   So don't patronize folks with gray hair like mine.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.920]   We may know a thing or two.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   It's all kinds.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.620]   And I find many kids don't know how to use cell phone.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.620]   That's true too.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.620]   That is actually true.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   A lot of kids are...
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.620]   That's true.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   I've got a dumb one that comes to tech.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.620]   Jake and come back.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.620]   Great panel.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.620]   Also Phil Libin is here.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.620]   Is it Libin or Libin?
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   I always ask you this.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.620]   It's Libin.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.620]   I get it wrong every time.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.620]   You've been doing it right the whole time.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.620]   Libin.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.380]   Former CEO and a really great guy at Evernote did so much work for them.
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.860]   But yesterday, got off the board.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.460]   Now I can be on the show.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.460]   That's how fast it happens.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.980]   Manjung director at General Catalyst, which is a Silicon Valley VC firm.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.300]   I want to ask a little bit about VC and a little bit.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.060]   Also my favorite person from Toronto.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.060]   Well you and Renee Ritchie actually.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.180]   Actually Montreal I should say.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.940]   GeorgiaDow of imore.com.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:55.520]   Did you come down with Serenity and Renee for the Apple event or stay up to state of
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.520]   Montreal?
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.780]   No, I actually went to a fireside conference.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:04.860]   So I was speaking during the event.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.860]   But it was amazing.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.860]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.860]   So I'm happy I got to do it.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.420]   And you got to try Serenity's AirPods or Renee's AirPods or something?
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.420]   Renee's AirPods.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.660]   I got to try them out and I got to try out the 7+ till I get mine.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.340]   And so yeah, it was really nice.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.340]   Kind of jealous.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.340]   I'm very interested in those AirPods.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.740]   But we'll find that next month.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.740]   Yeah, me too.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:24.740]   I'm looking forward to you.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.260]   I don't expect a lot from the first generation.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.700]   But I think it's a finger pointing in the direction that Apple wants to go.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.540]   They're better than you'd expect.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.180]   They're better in your ears.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.820]   I shook my head around to try to see if they would fall out.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.100]   That was my fear.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.260]   And they sound fabulous.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.540]   Like really, really nice.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.860]   So I think that you'll be excited to try them.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   All right.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.420]   I will reserve judgment.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.420]   Our show is brought to you today by Stamps.com.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:56.100]   If you do mailing of any kind at all, maybe you sell on eBay or Etsy or maybe you sell
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.100]   through Amazon.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.900]   If you have to do fulfillment or in your business, if you send out invoices or brochures, you've
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.780]   got to know about Stamps.com because if you're still going to the post office and either
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.020]   buying stamps or getting, you know, bringing this, I'm so sad.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.020]   I go to the post office.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.020]   I'm so sorry.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.020]   I'm going to go post office box.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.980]   I don't have to buy stamps anymore.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.420]   I got stamps.com.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.020]   But I see people waiting in line with their giant, Pitney Bose machine.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.260]   I'm still making.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.260]   Really?
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.260]   Really?
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.260]   You still doing it?
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.260]   It's like, come on.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.180]   Don't you know about Stamps.com?
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.460]   Stamps.com does everything you can do at the post office from your desk.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.220]   You could buy us postage at Stamps.com.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:36.300]   You could print it with, you don't need a postage meter or a special ink or anything.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.100]   You could print it from your printer with your computer.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.460]   You can do all the mailing and shipping you do there.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:46.580]   We're going to even get you a USB scale so you get exactly the right postage every time.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.300]   You also get all the forms filled out for you.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.300]   See, this is really cool.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.620]   If you sell on eBay or Etsy or whatever, it will actually pull the address that you're
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.220]   sending to from the website.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.060]   It will recommend the kind of mail.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.700]   You know, if it's a book, they'll say, well, this should be media mail and it'll print
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.260]   out the right exact postage, the right exact sticker to put on there.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.420]   You could print right on the envelope if you're just mailing paper and it'll print your logo
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.420]   on there and a return address automatically.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.500]   This post office loves Stamps.com, by the way.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:21.860]   It saves them time and money because it has that little bar code or QR code right on the
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.180]   Stamps so they can machine read it.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.860]   You get benefits from the post office right away that you're using Stamps.com.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:32.540]   For instance, there's a rule since 9/11 that if you're going to mail anything more than
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.220]   I think it's a pound, you have to bring it to the post office for inspection unless
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.780]   you use Stamps.com.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.740]   Then the mail carrier comes to you, they'll pick it up.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:44.140]   They will fill out all the international customs forms automatically.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.340]   They'll fill out certified mail forms.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.300]   They'll give you the cost for everything ahead of time before you buy.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.020]   It really is the right way to do fulfillment.
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.500]   If you're not using it, you've got to try it.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.420]   We've got a great special offer for you.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.660]   It's a four week trial of Stamps.com but you also get more.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:05.420]   You get $110 in bonuses, including that USB scale.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.620]   You get $55 in free postage that you can use.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.700]   Not right away but you have to spread it out over the first few months of your account
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.340]   but that's a big savings right there.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.420]   Of course, you get a Stamps.com.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.420]   Give it a try.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.420]   Go to Stamps.com.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.220]   Before you do anything else, click on the microphone.
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.260]   It's in the top right hand corner.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:31.780]   Type in "Twit" and you'll get that special $110 bonus offer.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.860]   We use it here all the time.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:40.740]   At Stamps.com, click the microphone and the offer code is TWIT.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:46.300]   It's anybody played with the new iMessages in that fund?
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.300]   It is fun.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.060]   It's kind of embarrassingly fun.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.460]   It's really interesting.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.140]   Already very annoying and some threads that I'm in but I'm optimistic that as people
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:59.140]   get it out of their system and settle into something that's actually fun and useful.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.540]   I'm playing words with friends in messages with my mom.
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.540]   That's kind of cool.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.660]   The whole idea of bringing the game into the message thread instead of the other way around
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:07.660]   is a big idea.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.780]   A lot of apps.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:14.140]   The only thing is because there's so much, there's a complicated user interface.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:19.900]   If you go into messages, you press the right arrow, then you press the app store.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.580]   You'll see what you already have but also there's a little four dot.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.820]   There's a lot.
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.380]   I bought a lot of stuff.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.820]   This is the stuff I already have.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:32.620]   By the way, if you have Evernote installed, it'll automatically add Evernote to the messages.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.620]   It'll add words with friends.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.660]   Evernote's got a really nice iMessage extension.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.700]   Easiest way to just message any of those.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.700]   These are my notes.
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.220]   I could send them notes out of my Evernote.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.980]   That's kind of cool.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:49.660]   It also has a, if you press plus, it has a very mind-bogglingly large store.
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:55.260]   A lot of people have said, "Oh, this is just a copy of Facebook Messenger or Line or WhatsApp."
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:02.980]   But because it's Apple, man, the developers have jumped on this.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.740]   Look at the categories.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.620]   Then of course, it's fun to see.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.580]   The number one money maker is Disney.
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:16.580]   They charge a buck 99 for Disney stickers and apparently they're getting it.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.460]   Here's for 99 cents, I like this one.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.460]   Mike Elgin told me about this.
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.820]   It's called Grammar Snob.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.780]   You can red pencil people's bad grammar in messages.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.780]   I've got that one.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.780]   It's horrible.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:26.780]   Don't do that to me.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.780]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.340]   It's supposed to be why you have apostrophe RE.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.340]   It looks like you actually wrote that.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.900]   You actually, it's red pencil.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.060]   Love that.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:43.500]   You got a favorite, Georgia, that you like from this?
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.820]   I love everything.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.460]   I love balloons.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.540]   I love lasers.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.140]   I love drawing things.
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.540]   It's just right now it's still new and fun.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:58.780]   I'm sure that I'll hit the point where I feel kind of annoyed with it.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.020]   Right now I enjoy it.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.220]   I still send it Moji though too.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.020]   That hasn't gotten a hold for me either.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.820]   I like Kat paint.
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.780]   You could take any picture and add a lot of cats to it.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:15.660]   I took a picture of Lisa and I just put a bunch of cats because she's a little bit
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:22.380]   cat crazy, like coming out of her purse, a little kitty arm, cats lying next to her.
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.580]   Man, that went over really well.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.540]   So I'm just saying, get cat paint.
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.540]   Cat paint.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.540]   I'm running it down.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.260]   You get that, cats.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.980]   What picture isn't better with cats?
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.060]   I think that's an interesting thing that the Apple has really gone all in on and what
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.860]   I really find amazing is how quickly the developer community said, "Oh, we'll do this."
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:49.620]   So conversational UX is the next really major development for how we interact with technology.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.180]   Was it a lot of work forever note?
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.900]   Do you know to support this or just kind of comes with the territory?
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.020]   I don't know the exact details.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.980]   My guess is doing anything well is a lot of work, even simple stuff.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.300]   Well, just figuring out, for instance, what a note-taking app would mean in a messaging
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   app.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.060]   What would be the context?
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.740]   The conversational paradigm is a really big deal.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:14.740]   You see it in bots, you see it in the iMessage extensions.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:22.740]   This is how the world is going away from a monolithic app and towards everything happening
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.900]   in line with an existing conversation.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:32.580]   You can't search for butt or huge, though.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.580]   You said it.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.820]   You could have searched, yeah, they fixed the butt part.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:43.220]   You and I, Larry, clearly are 13-year-old boys because we both snorted when I said that.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.020]   Wasn't there a problem with a butt with bringing a porn?
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.020]   They fixed that.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:53.700]   For instance, Deadspin said, "If you search for butt, you get a highly sexualized, my
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.700]   little pony, Jiff."
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.700]   Right.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.980]   I don't even know what that could be.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:05.740]   A woman emailed a verge that her eight-year-old daughter trying to send a message to her dad
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:09.460]   was presented with a very explicit image.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.460]   She had just searched for the word "huge."
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.700]   You can imagine what she found.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.740]   So they fixed this.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.700]   She said, "I grabbed the phone from her immediately."
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.900]   She typed in the word "huge."
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:22.900]   That's not sexual.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.900]   It's just a word.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.060]   It's not even like butt.
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.260]   One of Donald Trump's favorite words, actually.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.260]   Huge.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.260]   That's spelled with a Y, though.
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:30.260]   That's spelled with a Y, though.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.260]   If she'd spelled it with a Y, maybe you're okay.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.260]   I don't know, actually.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.260]   What would you get?
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.260]   I don't know.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.860]   Well, reasonably is banning butt.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:42.500]   Apparently, you can't search for you, Jenny Moore, either, which I don't know.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:47.900]   The search feature is powered by Bing, so you could blame Microsoft for all of this.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:55.140]   Anyway, just thought this would really give you a chance to try other words.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.420]   I do love that, though.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.420]   I do that all the time.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.380]   I used to do that in a Facebook messenger all the time.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.660]   To search for the right Jiff, you just type a word you want.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.060]   We do that in Giffy a lot.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.060]   It's awesome for G.I.P.H.Y.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.060]   Giffy.
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.580]   Hiss is in buzzes in the iPhone.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.620]   Do we care?
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.620]   What is that all about?
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:18.820]   Imore, of course, had the story because, well, it's Imore and Renee, Richie's on top
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.820]   of everything.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.820]   Yes.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.460]   He says it's not hiskate.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:30.100]   Apparently, some people are reporting a hiss from their iPhone 7 when they really get
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.660]   it working hard.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.460]   And/or hold it next to Snake.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:38.460]   Or they search for Snake in my message.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:45.540]   He says it's not unusual for devices to make noise when they pull more power.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.620]   I would be willing to argue.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.220]   I'm a tire wild guess here.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:53.860]   But as the phone heats up, remember, it's got this seal and this equalizing baffle.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:58.540]   I bet the hissings coming out of that old headphone port right there, whereas it equalizes
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.620]   the pressure as it gets hotter inside, my guess.
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:04.260]   Anyway, I haven't heard it.
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:08.260]   Apparently, it's not unusual.
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:13.700]   Although I think he says, and I think he's right, since the Galaxy Note debacle, people
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.140]   are always worried about anything happening.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.940]   Unusual sounds coming from there.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.100]   Yeah, thanks, hiss.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.100]   Thanks hiss.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.100]   Hiss happens.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.820]   What are you going to do?
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.820]   In other words, don't worry about the hiss.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.900]   We're talking about iOS 10 and its adoption.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.780]   It's interesting to compare the adoption of iOS 10 to the adoption of Android.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.580]   Oh my god, not even close.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:39.580]   It is.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.580]   It's really amazing.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.980]   What's iOS 10 adoption up to?
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.380]   In the first 24 hours, it was 14%.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.100]   By now, it's probably half.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:50.300]   That's very typical in the Apple world.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:56.740]   But one of the reasons, of course, is that Apple enables everyone to upgrade on day one,
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.260]   whereas in the Android world, it depends on your carrier, it depends on your handset.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.140]   Even if you wanted to upgrade, you may not be able to.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.140]   Absolutely.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.700]   So much easier in the Apple world.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.940]   I don't think it's a knock on Android.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.060]   It's just a good thing to understand.
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.740]   It's one of the reasons that security on Android is a challenge.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.380]   It's not Google's fault.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.220]   Manufacturers and carriers don't like to update phones.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.500]   They want you to buy a new phone.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:27.860]   If you look at it, Marshmallow, the latest, but one version, current version is NuGet,
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:32.020]   which doesn't even show up on this chart, by the way, because only a couple of phones
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.020]   have it.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   Marshmallow is 18.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.380]   You want your phone, don't you?
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:41.020]   I have to interrupt now because Josh can't live without his jet black.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.540]   I was going to wait.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.540]   It's beautiful.
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.540]   It is.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.540]   It's beautiful.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.540]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.540]   Look, scratch it.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.540]   Just scratch it already.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.540]   It's going to happen.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:50.540]   Just scratch it already.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.540]   Get it over with.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.540]   We did the same thing with this.
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.700]   He got a brand new Honda.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.980]   He said, and then he got a scratch, and he was devastated.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.780]   Now he doesn't get it.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.980]   Now he can drive the Honda.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.980]   Exactly.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.460]   Just get it done, then you can put the phone in your pocket.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.300]   I offered to put my plastic case on it.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.900]   He wouldn't let me put it on there.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:08.900]   Scratch it.
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.900]   Scratch.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:14.380]   You don't buy the Vader black phone and then put a case on it.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.300]   One does not just buy the Vader black phone.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.300]   No.
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:23.500]   No one knows that you have the -- no one can look at you lustfully about your phone.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.260]   That's why I buy clear cases, see?
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.140]   Not only that, you can't even tell it's an iPhone 7 unless you look at it really carefully.
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.340]   That's why you buy the jet black because the only one --
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.940]   Oh, I see them though, yeah.
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:34.940]   That's exactly it.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.580]   Apple is so smart.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:41.860]   That's why when I had to buy a gold iPhone 7, I was so humiliated because this isn't even
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:43.500]   last year's color.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.660]   This is 2014's color.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.660]   Oh, how awful.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.660]   You're not even my friend anymore.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:50.660]   That's it.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.660]   We're over.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.900]   And yet you bought the clear case to show it off.
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.060]   No, this is going to be for the jet black one when it comes later.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:01.940]   Because I did in fact -- this is really a first world problem.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.380]   I did in fact buy both.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:09.180]   One so that I'd have one for the shows this weekend that would come on the 16th.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.700]   The best I could do was gold and then the one I really wanted.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.060]   When did you order it, Leo?
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.660]   I was even faster than Phil.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.660]   I got online.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:22.060]   I sat there at midnight refreshing the website, refreshing the Apple store on the iPad, both.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.060]   I got on the iPad at 12.08.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.860]   I made a note of it.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.700]   I said, "Mark this time.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.100]   We're in."
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.340]   And then start the clock.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:37.500]   And then I immediately went to iPhone 7 plus jet black and it said October 4th.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.500]   Immediately.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:39.500]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.340]   So I just tried ordering one just a few minutes ago.
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.300]   And one of the problems I had is I told it I have an AT&T phone.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.060]   I wanted an AT&T phone.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:51.060]   But it wanted to know my account number and my fear is that it will disable my current
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.180]   phone when the new one ships.
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.980]   And I just want to pop my own thing.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:54.980]   Here's what happens.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:56.540]   And I'll tell you because I did the same thing.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:01.420]   This is to get the phone I had actually buy it through AT&T which further humiliated
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.900]   me.
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:07.100]   So it comes and I'm going to Europe.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.100]   I don't want to use AT&T.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.100]   I have a T-Mobile sim.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.100]   I want to use T-Mobile.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.100]   Right.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.100]   Unlocked.
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.660]   I have my phone I'm bringing and I have a T-Mobile phone.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.820]   And so this is the AT&T phone.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:22.460]   It would not, I thought, well if I do this before I activate it, I won't like tell it.
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.420]   So I put the T-Mobile sim in and said, "Ah, ah."
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.660]   So I put the SIM that it came with back in.
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.300]   But what you could do Larry is take your old SIM and put it in.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.300]   No.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.700]   What's going to happen is it will deactivate the old phone no matter what.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.700]   But I can put it back in my old phone if I want to.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.700]   Yes.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.700]   But you don't think you could go both ways.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.220]   I don't think it's a magical SIM you're putting in here.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.660]   So it comes with a SIM in it.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.060]   You could activate it.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.060]   So I did that.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.980]   I activated it on my AT&T number.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.380]   And I wasn't sure this would work.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.780]   But in fact I was pretty sure it wouldn't work.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.780]   But I thought, "All right, it's activated now.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:55.260]   Let's just put the T-Mobile sim and see what happens in work."
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.740]   Now, you have an X is 5X.
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.580]   So that the phone you're all shipping.
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.700]   So you can get to Project Fi on that.
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.700]   Do you have Project Fi?
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.700]   Yes.
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:06.780]   I use that exclusively when I'm overseas.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.780]   Yes.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   Because it's just a great deal.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.060]   It's the same overseas as it does in the States.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:14.740]   And then when I get home, I put it on pause because I don't need it at home.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:17.940]   Because T-Mobile and Sprint don't work very well where I live.
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.020]   But I just activate it whenever I go overseas.
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:24.020]   I have heard lately, and I don't know, I've traveled overseas in a while, but I have heard
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:32.500]   lately that T-Mobile always offered low speed 2G for free plus unlimited international texts
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.100]   and inexpensive 20 cents a minute phone calls.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.900]   But I've heard from some that lately it's been 3G or better that you're actually getting
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.900]   faster speed.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.900]   So I'm going to bring it.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:43.740]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.020]   Should I bring it to Russia though?
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:46.460]   That's the question, Phil.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.180]   Well, should I worry?
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:51.820]   You should worry, but you should bring it.
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.180]   You're going to be the district gentleman there?
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.660]   That's not a good answer.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:55.940]   I mean, you should worry, but I should bring it.
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:56.940]   You're not going to not bring it.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:57.940]   What are you going to do?
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:58.940]   Well, I'll bring it.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:56:59.940]   Leave it on the ship.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:00.940]   You know, you should bring it.
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.940]   You should wipe it afterwards though, right?
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:02.940]   Or not.
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:08.740]   Then to DEF CON, the general wisdom is you should, or black hat, you should wipe it afterwards.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:10.180]   I mean, the general wisdom is wiping.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.180]   It isn't going to--
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.180]   It's not enough.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.180]   It's not enough, yeah.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.180]   So we're so rude.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.180]   Not with a cloth anyway.
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.180]   Like that's what Hillary Clinton is.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.180]   You were so rude.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.820]   I wiped my phone.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:25.100]   Anyway, Marshmallow, 18.7% lollipop at about 35%.
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.340]   This is what you were saying about the story.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:31.060]   I think like Apple tells such a good story that people think they know why they should
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:32.900]   upgrade as soon as it comes out.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.900]   And with Android, you just don't--
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.580]   Well, yeah, some have-- and the other difference is what we already mentioned, which is not
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.740]   everybody who has an Android phone even has the option.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.100]   But I think this is of eligible, right?
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.100]   Like the Apple--
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.100]   Oh, is this--
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:45.100]   This is of eligible?
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.100]   It should be.
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:47.100]   That would be terrible.
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.100]   It should be.
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:49.100]   It may be not, but it should be.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:50.100]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.420]   Which is ironic, because I think of Android as a phone that geeks you with.
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:57.340]   I mean, I use Android because I like the flexibility and the geekiness of it.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:02.380]   But you would think that, you know, a lot of Android people would be tech savvy and
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:04.100]   they would be wanting the latest and greatest.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.100]   I think there is both.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.700]   I think there is a lot of us, and I include myself who use it because we like to fuss
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.060]   around and do things.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.900]   And you have much more flexibility in an Android phone.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:19.140]   And then it's also-- and I would say this is probably the majority of owners, the cheap
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.140]   phone.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:21.140]   It's the cheap phone.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.140]   Many countries.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.140]   It's the cheap phone.
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.140]   Yep.
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:28.500]   And so there are a lot of people who have phones that can't go past, you know, fro-yo
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.380]   or gingerbread or jelly bean or Kit-Kat.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.380]   I just like--
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:37.860]   But even in this country, if you buy a phone and it's-- even if it's not a cheap phone,
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.460]   you may not be able to upgrade for a while.
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:44.460]   They don't-- you have to wait until they get around to it, which can take months or
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:45.460]   years, some cases.
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:46.460]   No.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:49.460]   My Galaxy S7 is not yet nougat.
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:50.460]   Right.
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:54.260]   I think I don't think I have any nougat phones except for the Nexus phone.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.740]   Nexus, yeah.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.660]   I think that for a lot of people, they don't upgrade because they already know how their
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.660]   phone works.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:00.660]   They feel comfortable with it.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.900]   They understand the ecosystem.
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.100]   They understand the user interface.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.620]   And they don't want to change that.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:06.940]   They don't want something to happen.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.620]   They don't want something that they don't understand.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:11.180]   And that causes a lot of people anxiety.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.980]   And so once you're comfortable with it, they want to keep it that way.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:18.620]   I think Apple does a great job of giving you all of these candies and bells and whistles.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:21.700]   And, you know, if you have an upgraded people that have upgraded are saying, "Well, this
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:25.100]   would be sent with lasers," or they sent a heart, but you can't see it.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.300]   And that makes people say, "You know what?
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.780]   I really want to send hearts.
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:30.100]   I want to be able to do what you can do."
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.380]   And so that increases people saying, "You know what?
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:37.420]   I might have a little bit of anxiety of having to relearn how to use my phone again, or some
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:41.900]   things maybe change during a different place, but these cool things make it worth that hump
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.100]   to be able to go over it."
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.940]   And so Apple does a great job of being able to publicize why you want upgrade.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:51.260]   Plus, if some iPhone users found out last week, there is a risk during an upgrade that
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:55.580]   makes something to go wrong, and there is that "Ain't Broke, don't fix it" mentality.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:56.780]   And I think about that.
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:58.860]   I never upgrade, for example, when I'm traveling.
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.900]   Because I want to be home or have backup phones if something goes wrong.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:06.420]   Isn't the case, though, that the Apple doesn't tell you about the update for a while.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:12.580]   So you can find it if you go and look in your settings, but it's usually a week or more
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.980]   after the update is available that Apple will then start giving you a notification.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.340]   And obviously, I would upgrade the minute it's available.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.220]   Yeah, so keeps have the ability to go, "Oh, let's say, let's see.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.220]   Oh, I just read it.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.220]   It's out.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.500]   It was on I'm or everybody get it."
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.260]   But then most normal people will not update in the first week.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.820]   And by the time Apple has fixed any massive problems, and they'll get the notification
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.660]   that I think Apple actually does that quite well.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:39.180]   But partly because they complete, they were in a position to completely control the ecosystem.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:43.100]   When they came out, they held AT&T's feet to the fire.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.300]   When Verizon won an iPhone, they held their feet to the fire.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:50.860]   So they have better deals, frankly, than any Android manufacturer has with the carriers.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.860]   And they benefit from that.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.460]   Let's take a break because I want to, there is, we were talking about messages.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.780]   There is something comparable coming from Google I'm very excited about.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.780]   And it may be coming soon.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:09.460]   But first, a word from go to meeting, be a meeting MVP with go to meeting, step up your
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.220]   meeting game, take them to the next level.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:15.940]   Instead of having a boring old conference call, use go to meeting.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.420]   It's just like a conference call bridge.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.940]   In fact, you can have an audio only call.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.220]   It's nice, though, as you can do it on your phone.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:26.460]   But you can also do it on your computer using VoIP with your headsets.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.260]   It's built into the go to meeting software.
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:31.100]   You can do it on your iPad.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.700]   You can do it on your iPhone or your Android device.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.700]   So you've got the audio.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.660]   But then, and it happens to me all the time, we're in a conference call.
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.660]   I say, "Well, let me show you."
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.620]   And I have the screen sharing, and I turn that on.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:42.740]   And they go, "Oh, yeah.
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:43.940]   I have a PowerPoint presentation.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   Let me show you."
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.220]   Or I'd like to see you.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.220]   Let's turn on the cameras.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.540]   And you suddenly have HD video.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.700]   And it's kind of getting more and more like you're meeting in person.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.740]   And that's what's so great about it.
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.660]   You're on the same page with screen sharing.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.180]   It's like you're in the same room with HD video.
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.380]   You could pass off presenter duties.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.260]   It's a great way to collaborate.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.180]   It's a great way to present.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.420]   It's just the easiest solution.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.860]   Once you install GoToMeeting, and you do it free right now, if you go to GoToMeeting.com,
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:16.380]   you can set up a meeting in seconds.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.980]   There's even an integration into Outlook, Microsoft Outlook.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.820]   So you send an email.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.420]   Your client will get an email that says, "Hey, we're going to have a GoToMeeting 9 o'clock
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.380]   tomorrow morning."
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.900]   When the time comes around, it's in their Outlook calendar now.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:29.900]   They get a notification.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.700]   They click the link, even if they've never used it or installed it before.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.540]   30 seconds later, the software installs.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.380]   They're ready to go.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.380]   It's so easy for them.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.740]   And that's important too, because if you're presenting to a potential client, if you're
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.180]   pitching somebody, you don't want to make it hard on them.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.020]   You want to make it a great experience.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.020]   It is.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.020]   It invariably is.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.020]   It's really awesome.
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.140]   One click recording, built in audio.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.820]   Toll free calls is an option.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:59.860]   And you can do things like have back channel chats, which is always fun when somebody's
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.860]   presenting.
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.900]   You can send private links and so forth.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.900]   It's good.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:04.900]   It's the best.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:05.900]   GoToMeeting.com.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.740]   Try it free for 30 days and step up your meeting game.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:13.060]   Be a meeting MVP with GoToMeeting.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:19.860]   I think they've been one of our best advertisers supporters since, I think since 2005 or 2006
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.500]   for a long time.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:25.180]   We're talking about the week's tech news and early edition, because it's a getaway day
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.340]   for me.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:31.660]   I'm heading out and I'm a little disappointed because I've been waiting for Google's version
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.540]   of messages, Google Aloe.
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:40.180]   They announced it at WWDC in June, and they said it'd be out by the end of summer.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.300]   Well, when is the end of summer?
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.300]   September 21st.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.300]   Soon.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.300]   September 45th.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.940]   It's a funny game.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.300]   Sometimes companies will play.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.300]   Is it calendar summer?
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.300]   Is it Labor Day?
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.700]   Well, it's obviously not Labor Day.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:59.100]   Ev Leaks, who's usually pretty good on this, he says, it will be out this week.
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.780]   Aloe is going to be very interesting because all the things we're just talking about with
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:08.340]   Siri in your ear and the messaging platform, Google can do, and I think it intends to do
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:14.940]   with Aloe, including automatically pull up bits and pieces of apps, even if you don't
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.340]   have it installed.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.580]   Evernote, for instance, I don't know if they're going to do this, but they could if I don't
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:20.940]   have Evernote on my Android device.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.380]   By the way, it's cross-platform Android and iOS, which I really like.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.980]   This is probably an Android-only feature, though.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:31.140]   If I don't have Evernote installed, I can ask for something for Evernote, and it will
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.860]   download a little small bit of Evernote just enough to accomplish that.
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.580]   And then after doing the task, say, and if you want the full app that's available, I
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.020]   think that's great for app developers.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.900]   That's a chance for them to get some exposure.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:44.380]   It's great for users because it adds capability.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:49.980]   Aloe becomes your ombudsman, your middleman, the guy.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:55.220]   This is one problem I had with the chat platform on Facebook, for instance, where I was interacting
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.340]   directly with the bots.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:00.460]   They got annoying after a while with Aloe, and I suspect Apple is going to do this with
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.180]   messages, too.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:04.460]   It represents you to the outside world.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.300]   Do you ask Siri or do you ask Google now for something?
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:12.940]   And it handles, "Oh, I'll make that reservation for you," or "I'll call that Uber for you."
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.940]   We'll see.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.140]   It's supposedly coming out soon.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.820]   End-to-end encryption, but you have to turn it on.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.500]   That's a little controversial, but I think I understand why.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:30.900]   Google Assistant built in, and yes, sticker packs, "Will they be as good?"
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.940]   Apparently, there are some...
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:39.340]   Well, according to this, condoms, butts, and nipples.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:44.500]   Once again, Apple has hased you out of the dirty gifs.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.220]   You can get them from Google.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.220]   I don't know if that's...
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.580]   Now, when you use the Assistant features, do you have to turn off the end-to-end encryption?
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.580]   Yes.
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:53.580]   And that's exactly why.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.580]   The Assistant...
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:57.220]   Otherwise, the Assistant's not encrypted, right?
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.220]   The Assistant's listening in.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.580]   It's not encrypted.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:05.740]   And I think that's why Google made it optional and off by default, because they would obviously
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.900]   like to hear as much as possible of what you're saying.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.820]   And I don't mean to cast dispersion.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.460]   It's not like you're spying on you, but that's how they get the functionality.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.660]   Well, that's how they sell your information so they have a...
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.060]   Well, that's one way of looking at it.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:22.700]   But when I arrive at the airport, why Android phone will pop up my boarding pass and say,
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.260]   "I see you're at the airport."
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.260]   We got this.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.260]   This was in Gmail.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.260]   Yeah, but we do.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.260]   I think I'm gonna see that with you.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.260]   I just thought that.
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.260]   That's great.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.260]   You're an iPhone user.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.940]   You just don't know.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:36.940]   It's a great feature.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.900]   So they're gonna use your phone number instead of your Google account to identify you.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.900]   Right.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.060]   And that's probably good for most people, but you and I, Leo, have multiple phones, right?
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.060]   Yeah, I don't like it.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.060]   And I don't know what's gonna happen.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.500]   Does that mean my Google voice?
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.380]   I do put my Google voice number on all my phones.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.380]   I don't know if that's gonna work.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.380]   Duo does that as well.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.580]   And it made it a little bit less useful.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:07:00.660]   One of the things that's Apple does so well is one person, one account, all devices,
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:01.660]   same.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.060]   Same you, yeah.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.060]   Yeah, same you.
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.060]   So what for instance--
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.220]   Let's do it with Google accounts as well, if it's an actual--
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.460]   Yeah, but they're not doing that, are they?
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.460]   They're using phone--
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.460]   Apparently not in this case.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.460]   So Apple, for instance, if somebody calls me on FaceTime, it rings all my Apple devices,
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.660]   whichever one's handy is the one I can answer.
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.660]   Google Hangouts used to do that.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:20.980]   I'm guessing you'll be able to associate multiple numbers, but I'm not--
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:21.980]   You can't with Duo.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.300]   And that's what's weird about Duo.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.020]   Duo is tied to that phone number.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.020]   They can't--
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.020]   Well, you can't take the very--
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.540]   I can only call that number.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:32.100]   The same thing with WhatsApp also.
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.220]   You have to type in your number.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:37.980]   And I tried my Google voice number, but it doesn't always work because it can't validate
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.820]   that it's really my number.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:45.340]   So again, there's probably a rare group of people that carry multiple phones around.
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.580]   But I'm always got at least two of them.
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:51.780]   Yeah, you know, I guess we're probably a little odd in that respect.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.780]   A little odd.
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:53.780]   Anyway, Leo.
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:54.780]   Maybe not.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.580]   I think a lot of people have a work phone and a home phone.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.580]   Hillary Clinton?
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.580]   She has.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:00.580]   How many 11 blackberries?
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.580]   I get a lot.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.580]   Yeah, really.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.500]   I'm pretty sure this is something that they're going to fix, if not at launch, then immediately
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   after.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.420]   Like, it's a very good thing.
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.420]   Ask Jeff Jarvis.
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:15.100]   They've said they're going to fix the Google Apps account, merge that with your personal
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.340]   account for years and not--
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.620]   And they're already messing with--
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:20.700]   They may be messing with Google Voice.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.820]   They certainly have made it hard.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.220]   You have Google Voice and Project Fi at the same time.
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.220]   It's depressing.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.220]   I love voice.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.220]   I love Fi.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.220]   I love Fi.
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.220]   Yeah, so.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:37.140]   Amazon's dot suddenly dropped in price to $50.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.780]   You want to buy one?
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:40.380]   I've got one in a-- here, wait a minute.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.620]   You're not using your dot?
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:42.620]   Oh, no, no.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.620]   I love my dot.
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.620]   I couldn't get one.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.620]   Are they back in stock?
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.740]   Yeah, so before you had to have a prime account and an echo, and then you'd say I want
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.740]   to buy a dot--
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.940]   I don't know those, but now you can buy it.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:52.940]   Yeah, and brand new.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:54.940]   There's some of them in six packs, dude.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:55.940]   I want six of them.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.940]   So here's my problem.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:01.820]   I have a brand new one I just bought, but I bought it 45 days ago because I can't return
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:02.820]   it.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:03.820]   Oh, that's-- and that's the old one.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:05.820]   So I paid $90 for this guy, right?
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:06.820]   That's good.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:07.820]   I haven't impacted yet.
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:10.380]   And the new $60 one, or the $50, I think, $60.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.380]   $49.99.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.380]   $50.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:14.580]   So what do you offer me for this?
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.580]   Nothing, right?
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:16.580]   Nothing.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.580]   You got the wrong dot.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.140]   I can-- no, I have four echoes now.
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.140]   I love the echo.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.140]   Me too.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:22.140]   Is that weird?
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   Is that weird?
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.140]   It has a gift.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.140]   Still a good gift.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.140]   You can give it to the gift, right?
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.140]   Give it to an ignorant person who won't know it's the old guy.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.140]   But I'm kind of self-attooing your own.
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.140]   Look at this.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.140]   They're saying make it a six pack.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.020]   This cracks me up.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.180]   You buy five, you'll get one free.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.700]   If you want one in each room, you really do.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.980]   Well, two echoes now, and that's the most common thing I use at home.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:46.580]   The only thing that's not good about the multiple echoes is you can't go from room to
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:48.940]   room and listen to the same music like you can with Sonos.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.140]   That's going to change next year though, right?
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.580]   Is it going to-- I hope so.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.860]   They say they're going to add Sonos capability.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.860]   That'd be great.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:00.860]   My problem is if you have too many echoes, they sometimes more than one hears you.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.860]   Exactly.
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:07.420]   So the echo in the kitchen and the echo in the gym respond to me.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.940]   If I said a timer, they both go off.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.660]   Or one of them says, "I couldn't hear you."
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:16.740]   They're having this weird three-part conversation with a robot.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:20.660]   However-- I really want to put the echo in my car.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.900]   You know, I tried that.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.660]   I actually-- I had the portable one.
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.660]   What do they call the one that's not really--
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.660]   The tap.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.060]   The tap.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.660]   And I actually paired it with my phone.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.660]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:32.660]   And so it had Wi-Fi.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.660]   And it kind of worked, but it kind of didn't work.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:34.660]   It wasn't reliable enough.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.660]   No, but I want to tie the dot into the audio jack of the car.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:38.660]   Right, exactly.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:39.660]   So you could talk to the car.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.660]   And then I just haven't talked to you.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.660]   I've been permanently wired in with power.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:43.660]   Right.
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.660]   No, I think so.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.660]   The problem is-- we have many people who've tried that.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.660]   Of course, when power-- you turn off the car, it powers down.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:51.660]   It has to restart up again, re-acquire Wi-Fi.
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:53.660]   And it goes through that whole thing.
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:55.660]   So you need a battery.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.660]   It gets a little complicated after a while.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:00.660]   Well, but the battery-- you know, as long as you drive your car,
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.660]   the battery should stay charged up.
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.660]   The car would recharge and you'd drive.
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.660]   Yes.
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.660]   But as long as the echo continues-- it needs to have a continuous power.
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:10.660]   Power, right.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:11.660]   Right.
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:14.660]   And so if you turn off the car and the echo loses power,
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.660]   that's not good.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.660]   So you need some sort of back--
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.660]   Oh, I have Android Auto in my car.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.660]   And some of you may have Apple CarPlay.
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.660]   And it kind of gives you the same experience.
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:27.660]   But not as reliably, I think, as the echo does.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.660]   At least not my experience.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:34.660]   I love it that we've got this race between these companies trying
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.660]   to get better at this.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.660]   This is a great area to really excel in.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.660]   Google, of course, has its hello there, apparently.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:44.660]   The rumor says announcing it on the fourth,
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.660]   which will do a lot of what the echo says does.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:50.660]   I think you're going to see on your mantle in your living room,
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.660]   you're going to have four or five of these devices.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.660]   I try to be crazy.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.660]   Sometimes I say, hey, Google, and I should be saying Alexa.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.660]   Yeah, right.
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.660]   I could feel you.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.660]   Hey, Siri.
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:00.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:00.660]   Exactly.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:04.660]   If I just said Alexa, and she lit up, Alexa, who is Leo Laport?
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.660]   You know that there are people listening on their echoes right now.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.660]   You can all have it answering.
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:13.660]   Do you American technology broadcaster in Austin?
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.660]   See that?
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:15.660]   Now we'll be now holding you.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.660]   That's from Wikipedia.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:17.660]   Yeah, that's how it does.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:21.660]   Anybody in Wikipedia can have that ego gratification.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.660]   I probably just turned every Alexa in the world.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.660]   Well, that's, yeah.
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:30.660]   We'd grapple with this all the time because, of course, our audience,
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.660]   unlike other television shows, for instance, our audience,
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:36.660]   they're all sitting there and going, "Hey, stop triggering me."
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.660]   "Yes, stop triggering my echo."
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.660]   You know, it's funny.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.660]   I don't know if you ever think about this, but I do a daily segment for CBS.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.660]   And I sometimes take some sound, some sort of natural sound.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.660]   And then a couple of segments where I wanted to use a siren because it would have worked
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.660]   really well for my segment.
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.660]   You can't.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:51.660]   It occurred to me.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:52.660]   Wow.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.660]   You were driving.
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.660]   You don't do that.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:58.660]   We have, I work for, my radio show is for a clear channel.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:04.660]   And I have to do training because some idiot, clear channel, disc jockey in the
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.660]   audience, played the emergency alert tone.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:08.660]   Oh, no.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.660]   Oh, no.
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.660]   And the company had to pay a million dollar fine or something.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.660]   Wow.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:19.660]   And now every six months, I have to do training on what not to play on the radio.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:22.660]   Is it any training on the FCC rulings also about drilling?
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:23.660]   Oh, gosh.
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:24.660]   I have more training.
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.660]   I have to be trained constantly.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:27.660]   Right.
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.660]   Does he still have a job?
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:30.660]   The DJ, I don't know.
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.660]   That's a good question.
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.660]   I don't know.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.660]   I think probably not.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.660]   That's a pretty bonehead thing to do.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.660]   But DJs, that's their known for doing that.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:42.660]   There was a guy in San Francisco who decided to tie up the Bay Bridge one day in the morning.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.660]   Not a good idea.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.660]   Not a good idea.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.660]   I don't know why he thought that was a good idea.
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:49.660]   A little break here.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.660]   But before I get to the commercial, I think we should see this.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:59.660]   This is a short compilation of some of the best moments of the past week on TwitchWatch.
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:02.660]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:06.660]   I could probably retire now, but I don't plan to because I like what I'm doing.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.660]   I don't know why I would do it myself.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.660]   But how quickly would that get more?
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.660]   I don't want to be the guy at the bar.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.660]   Say, "Hey, anybody got any tech questions over here?"
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.660]   Android App Arena.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.660]   I've got an awesome guest.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:19.660]   You may know him.
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:20.660]   His name is Ron Richards.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:25.660]   All the games inside Pinball Arcade are actual digitized versions of real pinball machines
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.660]   that are out there in the world.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:27.660]   Nice.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:32.660]   You've got real pinball players using Pinball Arcade as a tutorial bus, which is amazing.
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:33.660]   Tech News today.
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:34.660]   What?
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:41.660]   Forrester released a report last month that predicts 6% of jobs will be taken over by bots by 20/21.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:48.660]   The jobs seeing the biggest impact include those in transportation, logistics, customer and consumer services.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:53.660]   Surely the jobs for people who like to take a news story is used to cause mass panic.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.660]   Those can never be replaced by a robot.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:57.660]   A corner of the market on that.
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.660]   To it, making the world safe for technology.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.660]   Oh, they did.
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:05.660]   That was kind of cool.
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:06.660]   They beamed us in.
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:07.660]   I didn't know we...
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.660]   Is that part of the new studio?
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.660]   That's nice.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:11.660]   You can actually for that?
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:12.660]   Sure we do.
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.660]   That was fun.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.660]   That was Frederick Johnson.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.660]   If you missed this week's new screensavers, we had a great chime with Frederick Van Johnson.
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.660]   What's ahead in the week?
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.660]   I don't care.
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.660]   I'm leaving.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.660]   But Megan Moroney does, so let's listen.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:28.660]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:29.660]   Here's what's coming up this week.
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:32.660]   Mac OS Sierra comes out on September 20th.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:39.660]   The update is free and includes some fabulous new features, including Siri for the Mac, Apple Pay for websites and more.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.660]   Get it.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.660]   And if you like to add GIFs or even GIFs to your wordy tweets, you're in luck.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:52.660]   Our sources say that starting tomorrow, Monday, September 19th, Twitter will stop counting images, video and other media in its 140 character
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.660]   account limit in tweets.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:16:01.660]   In VR news this week, if you're in the UK or Canada, you will finally be able to pick up an Oculus Rift, even if you didn't preorder one.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.660]   Also, Amazon's Fire HD 8 ships this week.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:12.660]   It includes Alexa integration, a larger battery, more RAM and storage, and it starts at only 90 bucks.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:19.660]   And finally, if you were the proud owner of a Burning Hot Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and you want to get a new one without an explosive battery,
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:22.660]   replacement devices should be coming out this week.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:30.660]   And also this week, Samsung will reportedly begin capping battery charge on the Galaxy Note 7 at 60% with an over-the-air software update.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:34.660]   The phones are officially recalled, as you know, so stop using yours, please.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.660]   And if you're selling them, don't do that.
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.660]   That's illegal.
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.660]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.660]   Oh, that's part of the CPSC recall.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:42.660]   You can't sell it anymore.
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.660]   Does that mean you don't get as much battery life if it's capped?
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:46.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.660]   That's kind of a bummer.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.660]   Well, why are you still using it?
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.660]   You're not even supposed to turn it on.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:53.660]   No, no, no, no, when you get the new one and you've got the new one.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:54.660]   Oh, no, no, this is not for the new one.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.660]   Oh, just for the old one.
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:56.660]   Okay, that's good.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.660]   Because I would hate the idea that they did that.
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.660]   I know.
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:03.660]   I want to start the tagline, Galaxy Note 7, grab them while they're hot.
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.660]   I had one.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.660]   I loved it.
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:12.660]   I was very sad, but I was not going to -- in fact, I even thought it was safe, but I was not going to bring it.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:20.660]   Well, I was doing two ways for the day when the official recall came out, which I think was Friday morning, which is the same day that Apple released the iPhone.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:21.660]   Nice timing, huh?
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:26.660]   Well, the greatest, I could say, you know, you got Samsung Galaxy Note 7 that are exploding and Apple's --
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.660]   I turned mine in for $850, got myself a brand new iPhone 7.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:31.660]   How about that, huh?
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:32.660]   Well, there we go.
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.660]   Well, you can check.
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.660]   You can check if you have the exploding exciting.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.660]   They're still saying they want them all.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:38.660]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.660]   And who's going to really go with it?
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.660]   Oh, well, it says here it's fine, so I'm just going to keep using it.
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:49.660]   I think it's like 97% of America and US Note 7s are within the exploding category.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:50.660]   Really?
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:54.660]   I think it's the -- not that they will explode, but they're -- that they don't -- it's not that everyone --
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:58.660]   They were made at the -- their batteries were made at the center where --
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:17:59.660]   In the Korean, the Korean, yeah.
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:00.660]   -- exactly, yeah.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:04.660]   And they've always contributed to what actually is causing the problem.
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:09.660]   Well, that's part of the problem is as much as -- I think Samsung has done a good job on this.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:12.660]   They haven't been completely forthcoming as to what the problem is.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:13.660]   Exactly.
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:17.660]   Because we first assumed it was just when you charge it was an overcharging problem.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.660]   That's very common.
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:22.660]   But apparently, some people are saying, "No, no, it's just a person in the flames while I was using it."
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:24.660]   How many have actually done that, though?
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:26.660]   Seven, eight, something like that.
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.660]   How many do you have?
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:28.660]   How many do I have?
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:29.660]   No, no, no.
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.660]   How many -- I heard 92 is what they reported in the US.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:33.660]   Yeah, 92 now.
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:34.660]   Okay.
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:35.660]   Yeah, but that's what they reported.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:36.660]   So who knows?
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.660]   Well, I think it's accurate.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:40.660]   But there may be incidents they don't know about.
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.660]   Come on.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:46.660]   If your phone first claims you're going to tell them, "Shh, don't tell Samsung.
[01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:47.660]   I want to keep using it."
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:52.660]   Well, there's only things, you know, I've been known to fall asleep with the phone next to me on the bed.
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:53.660]   You imagine?
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:58.660]   Well, I'm going to get on a plane every airline now is saying, "Don't bring it on the plane."
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:18:59.660]   And I'm going to get on a boat.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:00.660]   And I have to charge it.
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:01.660]   I'm going to be on the boat for a week.
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:02.660]   I don't want to --
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.660]   You can throw it overboard in the boat.
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:04.660]   Yeah, oh, yeah, great.
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:09.660]   Well, the fear is if it happens while you're asleep.
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:10.660]   Right.
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:11.660]   Right.
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:16.660]   Or if your child is using your phone or if it's near something flammable, this is a really big deal.
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:17.660]   It's a really big deal.
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:18.660]   Now, they're saying --
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:19.660]   It's a big deal.
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:27.660]   And this is the most recent news that they're going to have new Safe Samsung Note 7s in stores by September 21st by this week.
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:28.660]   Amazing.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:29.660]   I don't believe that for a minute.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.660]   It's amazing if they can pull that off.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.660]   I just find that very hard to believe.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.660]   Don't they have to get them vetted?
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:39.660]   Don't they have to say, "Well, bring them to UL or somewhere and say, "Okay, see?
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.660]   It doesn't blow up."
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:41.660]   Right.
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.660]   I don't think you can just say, "No, no, we're fixin' here."
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:48.660]   I mean, unless they had a run, that was some kind of a different process.
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:49.660]   Well, they think they know what it is.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:53.660]   They think it's the -- because for the first time every Samsung was making their own batteries.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:57.660]   Most of the phones were made with Chinese batteries as they had in past years.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:58.660]   Right.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:03.660]   But again, Samsung hasn't been super forthcoming about all these --
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.660]   Right.
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.660]   First, I heard that it was one of the suppliers with its fault.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:07.660]   And now I actually --
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:08.660]   Was their own affiliate?
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:09.660]   Their own affiliate.
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.660]   Well, they're on affiliate, right?
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:12.660]   But not all batteries came from that affiliate.
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:15.660]   No, in fact, that's why I guess my phone was made in China.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:18.660]   60 to 70 percent of their batteries did, though.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.660]   Right.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:23.660]   But any phone made in China, apparently -- don't quote me on this.
[01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:27.660]   But according to the Wall Street Journal, they said any phone made in China had the Chinese battery.
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:28.660]   Those were safe.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.660]   Most of the team mobile phones had Chinese batteries.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.660]   They were safe.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.660]   The team mobile guy, in fact, told me, "Well, you know, this is probably okay."
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:39.660]   And I did say to him, "Well, is it your advice that I not exchange it?"
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:40.660]   He said, "Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.660]   You should definitely turn it in."
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:43.660]   He didn't want to be responsible.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.660]   But yours didn't overheat, though, right?
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.660]   Never.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.660]   And then the question is, why are thumb made in the same factory overheating in others or not?
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:51.660]   Well, no, no.
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:52.660]   We think that it's the ones made with the --
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:55.660]   But even if you had one made in that factory, it may not have overheated.
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:56.660]   Right.
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.660]   And in the case of that, a million phones is a very small percentage.
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.660]   Right.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:01.660]   In fact, I think Samsung said it was only one in 38,000, one in 32,000.
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:06.500]   So the question is, what is it about those phones that are causing it versus all the rest
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.980]   that aren't getting hot?
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.180]   You know, you could blame it on Sally.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:15.740]   She forgot, you know, she was a little hungover that day, and she forgot to put in the little
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.220]   thing that checks the temperature.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:20.140]   I mean, do we really care like why?
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.580]   It's such a low occurrence.
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:22.580]   They recall the thing.
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:23.580]   Right.
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.580]   You're going to get new phones.
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.580]   They're not going to explode.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:26.580]   Right.
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:27.580]   Hopefully.
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.580]   This is not like the most gripping story that's ever been put in.
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.580]   No, it actually -- it actually -- it does work.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:33.580]   It actually works.
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:36.820]   It's a huge story because it really does wreck consumer trust.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.820]   Right.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.900]   Like companies spend billions of dollars to try to build up their brand.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:44.660]   That it's safe, it's reliable, it works, it does not explode.
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.980]   Hard to spin exploding as a feature, right?
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:47.980]   Keep warm at night.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.980]   I think it's -- I think it's Samsung's brand.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:50.980]   It's --
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:51.980]   It's -- it's a premium.
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:52.980]   It's a premium.
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:55.380]   And it's an expensive -- they react it to it in a correct --
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.380]   They handled it properly.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.380]   Probably very expensive.
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:58.380]   Well, they didn't have much of a choice.
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.380]   You know, they didn't react really quickly.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:04.140]   Well, they reacted as quickly as they could, I would say.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:08.100]   They didn't go to the CPSC right away, but they did say, "We'll take them back right
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.100]   away."
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:10.100]   They said, "We'll give you a $25."
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:16.580]   You compare this to like, you know, airbags and cars being kind of malfunctioning for years
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.580]   and took along.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:18.580]   Right.
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:19.580]   But this is -- I have a car.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.180]   In fact, my car has a malfunctioning airbag, I'm told.
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.780]   But the replacement isn't available yet.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:28.420]   And nobody told me I could take my car back to the dealer and get a loaner until the new
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.420]   airbag comes out.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:30.420]   I'm still driving the thing.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.420]   Right.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:32.420]   So --
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:33.420]   Right.
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.420]   This was handled as well as could be, I think, handled.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:37.020]   It's just -- it's hard -- I think it's hard on the company.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.260]   And I think it's a lot of money.
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.260]   Well, that's the other thing is it's a premium phone.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.260]   Well, they rushed.
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.260]   They rushed to get the phone out.
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:43.260]   Is that why you think that --
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:44.780]   So, you know, they were trying to be Apple.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:46.260]   They were trying to be Apple to the punch.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.100]   And so they probably did -- they caught where they could.
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.100]   They couldn't cut in --
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.100]   Right.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.100]   They probably cut a little bit, tried to rush manufacturing.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:56.260]   They're probably working extra hours, a little bit more tired.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:59.300]   And then they didn't have the same amount of time that they would have in order to test
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.300]   the phone.
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.100]   So, yeah, probably some of them kind of went underneath the radar.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.700]   Will people buy Note 7s now?
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.260]   So here's my -- yeah.
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:19.900]   Or will people buy an iPhone 7 Plus instead of an Open
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:26.620]   completely different device?
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.620]   Right.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:31.060]   In another month or two, people are attention spans.
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.700]   Unfortunately, unfortunately are really short.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.180]   And this will no longer be a story.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:38.380]   There'll be some other interesting scandal that we'll be covering.
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.700]   And so people will go back to their phones and be happy with them.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.340]   It's barely a scandal now.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.340]   Or not at all.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.340]   It's not a scandal.
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:45.340]   Right.
[01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:46.340]   And it's barely a story now.
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:47.340]   Of course, it's not going to be a story in two months.
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:48.340]   Right.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:49.340]   They did the right thing.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.340]   They recalled them.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.460]   I bet you, though, they don't sell many Note 7s going forward.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:57.980]   They'll be the new Google phones come out in October 4th.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.180]   I think this will benefit cool as much as it benefits that.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:03.620]   It's definitely a big hit to the current product line and to the current brand.
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:07.340]   They made a mistake and now they're paying for it.
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:11.020]   But I don't think there's anything like un-virtuals and how --
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.820]   It's also a huge company.
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:13.820]   And they can absorb.
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:14.820]   Yeah.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:15.820]   Right.
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:16.820]   That's exactly my point.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.260]   If it were a smaller company, I would worry about the dying of the result of this.
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.460]   Blackberry, this would be it.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:22.460]   It'd be all over.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:23.460]   Oh, of course.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.180]   Maybe all over anyway.
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.380]   Blackberry goes under because of the Note 7.
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:28.380]   That's all.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:29.380]   That's the story.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:33.420]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace, the place to make your most beautiful site
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:38.500]   ever, but not only beautiful, but beautifully engineered, whether it's a portfolio or a
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.340]   blog or you're selling because every Squarespace site comes with commerce.
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.380]   It's hosting plus the software.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.420]   And they work so tightly together.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:50.300]   You get a really virtuous circle here.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:54.860]   So for instance, one of the reasons Squarespace sites never go down is because the software
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.980]   will automatically spin up new instances whenever they're banned with, you know, when
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:00.540]   you see a lot of traffic.
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:05.420]   And so they can handle giant jumps in traffic that no other hosting company can handle.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.860]   They also have really smart engineers.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:12.820]   So the designs -- and I think Squarespace is famous for just the beautiful designs on
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:13.900]   their templates.
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:14.900]   They look great.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.780]   Under the hood, everything's mobile responsive.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:21.700]   So it looks -- in fact, when you upload an image to your Squarespace site, the software
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:27.300]   automatically makes nine different versions of the image for any possible size screen.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:30.460]   Every screen, it looks great as they resize perfectly.
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:35.500]   The e-commerce is one of the few places where the e-commerce kind of matches the look of
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.500]   the site.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:39.260]   It's not a separate shopping cart just hanging off the side of it.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:42.300]   So you can create, manage, and brand your store in a beautiful way.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:45.740]   They now, by the way, support your merchant card.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.100]   They support payments.
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.100]   They help you with shipping.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.020]   They have analytics for commerce.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.740]   You can see the traffic of visitors in real time.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.140]   You can see abandoned checkouts, device filtering.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.140]   So, you know, oh, we sold twice as many to iPhone users.
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:00.620]   It's really a great platform.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:05.660]   If you're interested in creating a page that's like a news page, they have these great magazine
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.740]   templates now with grid-style landing pages.
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.940]   So you can, this is all the rage.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:15.540]   You see this in the verge and Yahoo Tech, for instance, browse through all the posts in
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.540]   one place with infinite scroll.
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:22.300]   You can have related posts if you want at the bottom that gets your users to read more
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:26.300]   author profiles, integrated search in the header so they can find stuff.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:31.700]   I mean, this is really stuff that if you were to go to a designer and an engineering team,
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.260]   would cost an awful lot of money.
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:35.220]   I know I've done it.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:39.420]   You get it all very affordably as part of your Squarespace subscription.
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:43.820]   By the way, if you've created three or more active Squarespace websites, you now can join
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:50.020]   the Squarespace Circle, which gives you advanced guides and optima support and longer trial
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.900]   periods for new projects, up to six months.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.460]   That is awesome.
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:57.420]   Squarespace has also added domain names.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.660]   They sell domain names.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:00.300]   You'll get a free one with an annual purchase.
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.500]   They've always done that.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:07.380]   But you can also go there to buy one of over 200 TLDs, of course.com.net.org, but some
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:11.340]   of the wild wacky ones.biz and so forth from Squarespace domains.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.260]   And this is a really nice feature.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:17.260]   They'll give you a clean, spam-free parking page until you're ready to start building
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.580]   that site.
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.020]   That is sweet.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.020]   Squarespace.
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.580]   I want you to go right now, join the million Squarespace customers who get the best hosting,
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:31.260]   the best software at the best price with e-commerce, with mobile responsive design.

[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:35.980]   offer code TWIT.
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:36.980]   Do me a favor.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.980]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:38.980]   You'll do yourself a favor, too.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.980]   You get 10% off.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:42.140]   Squarespace.com.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:45.340]   Here's the--thank you to the chatroom.
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:46.340]   Here's the DJ.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:47.340]   Bobby Bones.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:52.820]   I guess he's a well-known syndicated country show.
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:28:00.860]   In 2014, he broadcast the EAS signals and cost his company, my company, a million
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.420]   dollars in fines.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.380]   They could have given you a wraith.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.380]   He's still working.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.380]   He's still working.
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:07.380]   He's still working.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.380]   They like him.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:10.060]   He is--well, he's a star.
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:11.060]   And you know what?
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.980]   If you're a star, DJ, you can do--it is now the biggest country music show ever.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:19.220]   Well, maybe the publicity was good for him.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:20.980]   Everyone knows his name now.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:22.180]   Oh, Bobby Bones.
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.180]   Who doesn't?
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:25.260]   Who doesn't know Bobby Bones?
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:28.380]   Maybe the emergency tone sounded better than the musicals.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.380]   You don't like country music?
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:30.380]   No, it's not a fan.
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.780]   Not a fan of the twang, the torch and the twang.
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:35.660]   And I just--I'm just really fond of test tones.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:38.620]   You're like the fax machine recordings.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.900]   Two million people watched football on Twitter on Thursday night.
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.540]   That's amazing to me.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.820]   Blows me away.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:48.260]   I thought, why is Twitter streaming football?
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:52.340]   Now it wasn't all at the same time, two million.
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.500]   You know, that was spread out over the game.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:29:00.100]   But still, that's a surprising number of people watching football on Twitter.
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.100]   Did anybody--
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:04.260]   I can't really think of people that are at work or have to be doing something else or
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:05.460]   having a family meal.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:09.900]   And so they're sneaking their phone underneath the table so they can watch without anyone
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.700]   knowing that they're watching the series.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.580]   I can see that people would be watching it on Twitter.
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:19.380]   The average cat was 243,000 at any given time.
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:23.140]   2.3 million--oh, okay, now wait a minute though.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:28.100]   The average watched 22 minutes, but 2.3 million watched at least three seconds.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:29.100]   Oh, come on.
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:31.100]   I don't know if I can--
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.100]   No.
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:34.020]   That's when you didn't know it was football.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:35.020]   What's this?
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:36.020]   Oh, moving on.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:39.260]   Three seconds is the longest I've ever watched football.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.460]   I think the idea is--
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.300]   You might have been counted in the numbers.
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.900]   Yeah, you were.
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:46.860]   The idea is that if football, it's fun to watch with the community.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.060]   I mean, that's one of the things Twitter is kind of cool is a lot of people.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:54.140]   I mean, for a long time, I would only watch the Academy Awards with the Twitter stream
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:56.140]   running, the snark running in the background.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:59.740]   I can't do it in the West Coast with some of the other war shows because they're not
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:03.220]   live, but with the Oscars you could do it.
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:04.220]   So I think that's Twitter's right.
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:07.700]   I think that's because the Oscars are kind of dull without, you know, I like the badger.
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:08.700]   Actually, right.
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.300]   Or Ricky Gervais, if he's doing anything, I'll watch, but I just watch his clips.
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.300]   Right.
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:16.580]   I remember the presidential debate, the first one between Romney and Obama, and I'm watching
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.980]   it thinking Obama's blowing it.
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.700]   And I kind of felt that right, but when I went on Twitter, it confirmed because all
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:27.020]   my friends, many of whom are Obama supporters and some aren't, confirmed that he was blowing
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.020]   it.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:31.740]   It was kind of a nice validation to realize that I was observing this the way other people
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:32.740]   were.
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:35.100]   Things have changed in four years, my friend.
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:38.740]   I think it's interesting though, because that can actually change public opinion.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:39.740]   Absolutely.
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:44.300]   We can actually change the way people feel about something just by having enough of a
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:48.660]   group that say differently than your own opinion, slowly your opinion will sway because
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.900]   of that, you know, group trial.
[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:50.900]   And I bet you.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:54.620]   I bet you some people were thinking about that with the debates coming up.
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:59.340]   I mean, because if you can move a small public opinion in a presidential election as close
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.100]   as this one is, it can actually have a difference.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.100]   I really like the internet.
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:06.300]   Which candidate of the two major candidates, actually of all four candidates, which one
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.300]   uses Twitter best?
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:11.260]   Oh, yes, they're most best or most?
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:12.980]   Well, what does best mean?
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.780]   Well, he's sensitively.
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.700]   He's very effective on Twitter.
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:17.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:18.700]   He's a Twitter.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:19.700]   He's the Twitter candidate.
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:25.380]   I mean, I know Hillary does tweet, but I mean, they're just bland tweets, you know, normal
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.380]   campaign tweets.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.380]   Right.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.940]   I don't know if Jill Stein tweets.
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.940]   I don't, I'm sure he does.
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:34.700]   I don't know if Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate tweets.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:35.700]   I'm sure he does.
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:38.940]   But who's the master of Twitter?
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:44.340]   I would say arguably of all Twitter, not just political tweets, but of all Twitter.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:45.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:47.500]   That's possible.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.660]   You could be a much, you might even follow this.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:54.860]   You might even say he was created, some ways created by Twitter.
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:56.860]   11.6 million followers.
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.860]   That's amazing.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:01.820]   That's more people than watch most television show than any given time.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:05.580]   Doesn't mean that's 11.6 million fans or people who are.
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:06.580]   No, they aren't.
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:07.580]   I follow.
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:08.580]   I follow them.
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.580]   I follow all the candidates.
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:10.580]   It's the most interesting feed on Twitter.
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:11.580]   Absolutely.
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:12.580]   You never know what's going to happen.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.580]   Today, I didn't know that.
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:16.700]   He said, "Today's happy birthday to the United States Air Force."
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.420]   I wouldn't have known that if Warren for Donald Trump.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:21.460]   You see, it's educational.
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.180]   It's educational.
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:28.180]   I guess Twitter now is on Apple TV as well.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:30.940]   I just actually just got the Apple TV update.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.140]   What does that look like?
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:36.580]   It's a pretty decent sit back on your couch experience.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:37.580]   The whole screen is Twitter?
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.420]   Or is it like a sidebar?
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:43.260]   It's the whole screen, but they're really trying to optimize the media, the watching.
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:46.420]   I guess with Apple TV, you couldn't be an inset.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:48.820]   You have to take over.
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:57.540]   On the Xbox, I can, for instance, watch NFL and have my fantasy stats on a sidebar.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:59.860]   I think you might be able to do that with Twitter.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.020]   That's what they should be able to do.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.180]   That would be interesting.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:04.340]   You're watching a show and you're seeing the Twitter feed.
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:06.100]   That's what you did, Larry, right?
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.100]   You had your tablet or your laptop open.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:09.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.860]   I just keep my laptop or my phone or whatever than watching events that I want to get opinions
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.860]   on.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.860]   Right.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:18.380]   Probably better on a second screen, though, by the way.
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:20.900]   You're better of having the feed on your phone or your tablet while you're watching
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:21.900]   on TV.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:26.580]   You can control what you want to pay attention to when, instead of having things scroll by
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.580]   right as part of the game.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:31.780]   The other thing is, if I watch the show with my wife who does not want to know what my
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:36.260]   Twitter friends think, she just wants to watch the show, it would be very annoying if the
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.500]   feed were on the television set.
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:42.580]   It's kind of my private little thing on my phone or my computer, and she watches a TV.
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:43.580]   Right.
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:44.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:45.580]   It would be distracting.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.340]   Having someone trash your favorite character.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:54.380]   Facebook also very much wants to be that go to social site that you have side by side.
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:34:01.660]   It has never really, I think in my mind anyway, taken the place of Twitter in that regard.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.020]   They're gathering debate questions.
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:06.180]   We've got a debate coming up.
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:10.980]   I'm not sure if these questions will be used to the debate or not.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:14.140]   They were in fast, the Republican debates, right?
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:15.980]   They had official deals with the networks.
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:16.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:17.980]   They were so dopey.
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:18.980]   They did the same thing with YouTube.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:22.620]   They got, now a question from YouTube.
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.700]   Why do you part your here on the left?
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:30.500]   I mean, I really felt like this was really not a good idea, but I guess it maybe made
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.540]   people feel like they were part of the process or something.
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:35.540]   I don't know.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:40.020]   Facebook's vice president of product management says newsfeed curates, curates, interesting
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.020]   choice of word.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:45.100]   2,000 stories a day for users.
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:50.860]   We make them for you, but only 10% of them are actually read.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.620]   I never even noticed it.
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.580]   I know they're up there on the right hand side, but I'm not looking for them.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:56.580]   Is this the trending story?
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:57.580]   Is that what this is?
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:58.580]   The trending story.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:01.540]   The new speed story.
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.020]   Newsfeed is different.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.020]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.020]   You're in the middle.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.660]   The trending one is the automated one.
[01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:07.660]   Right.
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:08.660]   That's the one I pay no attention to.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.900]   It's the one that cares.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.740]   On the, wow, listen to this.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:19.020]   On average, people in the US spend 45 minutes a day on the Facebook newsfeed.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:23.100]   Slowly and steadily over time, people are spending more time reading more, liking more,
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.260]   and commenting more.
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:29.900]   That's what Facebook's trying to do, increase engagement with that newsfeed.
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:33.700]   They're doing a good job.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.500]   The thing about Facebook is it's for everyone.
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:39.940]   It's not just for geeks or political junkies or people who are intensely interested in
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.100]   a particular topic.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:45.860]   Twitter is, it just seems like everybody I know is on Facebook.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:48.860]   It's different from what I originally thought Facebook was going to be.
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.620]   I'm going to go see pictures of my family and friends and their kids and stuff like
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:53.620]   that.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:54.820]   I really thought that's what it was going to be.
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:59.660]   Then gradually, it just became this hodgepodge of stuff I'm going to, and I think this is
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:01.940]   what Facebook's trying to do, of stuff I might be interested in.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:05.180]   They algorithmically tune it to make it stuff I'd be interested in.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.180]   I spent more time reading it.
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.700]   It's a mix of everything.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:11.300]   It's like a little cocktail party on wheels or something.
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.420]   They've managed to do a bunch of things pretty well.
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:16.340]   Really reinvent themselves a few times.
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:18.780]   They relevant, better than Twitter's been able to do.
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:19.780]   Much more nimble.
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:24.020]   I think Snapchat's the real surprise thing that came out of almost nowhere.
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:27.340]   The funny thing about Snapchat is since it's so personal you don't see it.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:29.260]   You don't know what's going on in Snapchat.
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:31.020]   Which is part of the brilliance.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.660]   You have followers, but you're not really sure who's seeing it.
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:36.580]   You're not really sure how many followers people have.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:41.820]   But I really think the stories on Snapchat are pretty great.
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:47.140]   I'm impressed with how the news organizations, the brands, have they really taken to making
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:48.140]   stories.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:51.020]   That discovered channel has been huge for Snapchat.
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:52.660]   It's non-trivially good.
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:57.300]   Do you think Instagram's attempt to copy it has been paid off?
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.780]   Not yet, but we'll see how that goes.
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:03.380]   I think it's not a bad idea for them to pursue it because it's been so successful
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.460]   for Snapchat.
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:11.940]   Feds are, well according to Wired Magazine soon will be able to legally hack you.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:12.940]   Anybody.
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:13.940]   Great.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:14.940]   Yeah, nice.
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:17.140]   It's probably not hacking if it's legal.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:19.420]   Well you tell me if it's hacking.
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:25.740]   The Justice Department is planning a vast expansion of government tools.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:29.860]   Under a new set of rules the FBI would have the authority to secretly, now you tell me
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:31.260]   if it's hacking.
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:37.580]   You could probably use malware to access thousands or hundreds of thousands of computers belonging
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:40.140]   to innocent third parties, even crime victims.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:46.660]   This would be legal according to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:50.700]   The government could hack a million computers or more with one warrant.
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:51.700]   Oh great.
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:53.300]   Now they only do it in the information.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.860]   I don't see anything that could go wrong there.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:56.060]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.060]   It doesn't.
[01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:02.260]   They use that information against you if they manage to find out you're doing something illegal.
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:03.260]   Well this is what they say.
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:07.820]   They need this power to investigate a network of devices infected with malware and controlled
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:08.820]   by a criminal.
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:15.660]   But you know many of us, well not me, but many of you, your computers are without your
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:21.100]   knowledge occupied by malware which allows a bad guy to use you against other systems
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:24.380]   with DDoS attacks as a botnet.
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:28.860]   So apparently they're asking for permission to examine your computer to see if you have
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:29.860]   a bot on it.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:30.860]   How do you feel about that?
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:34.540]   I'm sure that they won't use anything else that's on your computer against you if they
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:36.020]   still happen to find it.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.820]   You know I don't think the snark is the right way to handle this.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:42.660]   I think they need to be able to combat botnets.
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:48.300]   It's obviously pretty dangerous to expand this authority, but we should have pretty hardcore
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:53.940]   rules about what they can and can't do, who sees it, who doesn't, what are the rules for
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:55.500]   evidence gathering.
[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:58.660]   Like this is a real thing that we need to confront.
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:04.820]   If Congress doesn't weigh in December 1st, this new rule goes into effect, seems unlikely,
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:06.980]   Congress is going to do anything.
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:12.660]   I do understand why the FBI would love to be able to be proactive in fighting these
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:13.660]   botnets.
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:14.820]   We'd all like them to succeed in this.
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:15.820]   This is a massive problem.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:20.380]   Just like by definition of what a botnet is, you have to be able to say like these are
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.380]   the, here's a million computers infected with it.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.380]   We need to do something.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.380]   Why do we need the FBI?
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:27.860]   I've just got a call from India the other day telling me that my computer was affected
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:29.700]   to you from Microsoft.
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:39.180]   So I'm going to put myself in the shoes of federal, you know, law enforcement agent.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.180]   Somebody's very sophisticated about technology.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:44.740]   We would like, let's say what we would like to do is create a, I'm not going to call it
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:45.740]   malware.
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:46.740]   That's wired's term.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:50.580]   I'm going to create a tool that automatically spreads throughout the internet.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:54.420]   It looks at your computer and examines it for a bot.
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:59.580]   If it finds when it does some forensics to figure out who the bot's contacting, what
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:02.260]   the bot's up to, and then deletes the bot and moves on.
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:03.260]   Would that be okay?
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:06.580]   It would be okay with me as long as it asked me for permission in advance.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:09.140]   No, no, I can't ask you for permission in advance.
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:12.860]   Well, no, no, if I'm a victim of a botnet, I might, if I'm a potential victim, I'm just
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:14.420]   average Joe citizen.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:17.860]   I might want the government to help me keep blocks out of my computer.
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:18.860]   Well, it's not going to know.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:24.260]   I mean, if it needs to ask you for permission in advance before it can look or before it
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:25.260]   does anything.
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:31.260]   Well, what I'm saying is I would be willing to allow some trusted authority that I trusted
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:36.660]   if the government qualifies to help me keep bots out of my computer.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:42.740]   What I want to do, just like I don't want criminals prowling him around my backyard.
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:43.740]   That would be a good thing.
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:49.780]   I agree if it's the, Congress, Congress doesn't have the technical knowledge in order to make
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:53.620]   these decisions so that they're actually protecting the privacy of the people that are going to
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.740]   be having this.
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:59.940]   In comparison to if a company say, Apple said, listen, we would like to systematically,
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:03.060]   every once in a while, check your computer to make sure that you do not have any malware
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:04.060]   on it.
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:06.500]   I would have a completely different opinion on this.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:11.580]   But because we know that any government will want to have more power in order to protect
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:16.740]   you, but then that power could be used against the same people that they're hoping to protect.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:22.020]   And then to control the way that people vote, sway public opinion, and also be able to monitor,
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:27.820]   which we already know that they are doing at a vast, expansive place in a very closed,
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.180]   enclosed kind of way without our knowledge.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:34.300]   I think that they've already set the precedent of not being able to feel, to have the public
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:35.860]   feel comfortable and trusted.
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:36.860]   Well, like a TSA.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.860]   Now, just change your opinion.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:42.620]   And if I tell you that this article I'm reading from Wired, this opinion piece, was written
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:46.380]   in part by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:48.620]   He is a very much a member of Congress.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:51.300]   He's actually one of the smartest in terms of technology.
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.020]   He serves in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.860]   He's worried about this and his--
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:59.500]   I think that's a change, but he believes that Congress is not going to act on this.
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:03.660]   Also, Matt Blaze, who's a professor of computer information science at the University of
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:08.820]   Pennsylvania and Susan Landau of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where she also teaches
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:10.580]   cybersecurity policy.
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:14.180]   So these three people are pretty serious about all of this.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.580]   They're very concerned.
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:21.580]   They also say the FBI statements to date don't inspire confidence that it knows what it's
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:22.580]   doing.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:27.900]   One FBI special agent testified that a tool was safe because he had tested it on his home
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:33.180]   computer and it, quote, "did not make any changes to the security settings on my computer."
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.180]   End quote.
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:35.180]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:37.460]   Obviously, that's not enough.
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:41.100]   On the other hand, I do think appropriate-- I agree with you, Phil, and appropriately
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:46.460]   giving them the tools to do this kind of thing with appropriate privacy guards is not a bad
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:47.460]   thing, but the problems--
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:51.140]   If we believe that they are not violating their own privacy policies and standards,
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:54.100]   then that was part of the problem with the whole Medicaid issue, Snowden--
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:57.580]   I mean, they really want to do this and I'm wondering why they really want to do this,
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:58.580]   right?
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:42:59.580]   There's lots of things they could do with it.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:04.820]   It would be useful to think about how would you be comfortable with the situation being
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:05.820]   handled?
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:08.660]   It's easy to say, we don't trust the FBI.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:11.140]   I don't particularly trust them by default either.
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:12.860]   But you should.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:13.860]   Exactly.
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:14.860]   That's like you're not supposed to.
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:15.860]   Right.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:17.980]   The government goes through our stuff every time we got on an airplane.
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:22.540]   By the way, you had marijuana on your bag and they found that, they would arrest you.
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:26.020]   That's different because you've gone out in public and you've given permission.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:28.060]   Same thing as driving.
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:33.620]   You are using these public transportation systems and part of the deal is you agree to
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:35.540]   give us some rights to use them.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:37.900]   But my point is that you're in your own home now using your own computer.
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:40.100]   You're connecting to the internet, which is a reason.
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:44.140]   The reason you're going through a metal, you're getting inspected, you get in the planes
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:45.660]   to make sure you don't have a weapon on board.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:49.900]   It's not to make sure you don't have some other illegal substance that may remain dangerous.
[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:50.900]   A botnet's a weapon.
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:53.020]   Connecting and infecting computers to the internet is a dangerous--
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.020]   Right, but my point is, well, I'll have--
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:56.700]   People understand, but they broaden the search to--
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:57.700]   Let's say, discover something else.
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:58.700]   Other stuff, yeah.
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:03.140]   And it could be something like terrorism, which is a horrible, dangerous crime, but still,
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:04.380]   would they be able to act on that?
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:08.260]   There does have to be a limit on any fishing expeditions, obviously.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.180]   And the Supreme Court has ruled on things like this.
[01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:17.300]   In fact, there's quite a famous ruling involving police officers investigating reports of a
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:22.140]   bullet being shot through a wall, seeing stolen stereo equipment, looking at the serial numbers
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:24.340]   and arresting the perpetrator.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:27.900]   And it was thrown out by the Supreme Court because they said, "You were there to investigate
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:32.180]   the bullet, not check the serial numbers on the home stairs.
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:34.340]   You exceeded your authority."
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:37.220]   Did they see the stereo through the bullet hole?
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:41.060]   No, they actually went into the guy's apartment and said, "Did you shoot a gun and, by the
[01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:44.340]   way, where'd you get that stereo system?"
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:45.340]   And I'm sure--
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:46.340]   This is an interesting balance.
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:49.140]   Hey, we got to take a break because I have to get out of here pretty soon.
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:54.660]   And I want to mention our great sponsor, Casper, a maker of amazing mattresses.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:57.980]   It's really interesting how this has become a category, right?
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.060]   This is reinventing-- This is what I love about the internet.
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:06.180]   Reinventing the things we do in the normal-- in the normal corpus of events, but using
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.260]   the internet to make it work better.
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.660]   Now, often that means eliminating the middleman.
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:14.500]   But in this case, it's more than that because, of course, we've all been putting up with
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:18.900]   this idea that you can go lie on a mattress for five minutes in a brightly lit showroom
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:23.940]   with a salesperson glaring at you and know, "Oh, this is the right mattress for me, baby.
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.380]   I'm taking this one home."
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:29.740]   Casper, because they don't have showrooms, has found a better way.
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:31.220]   They had to find a better way.
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:34.500]   They let you get this beautiful mattress.
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:40.140]   It's engineered to perfection made in the United States, a springy latex foam, supportive
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:43.540]   memory foam, so you get a beautiful sleep service, award-winning, in fact.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:47.740]   They got the 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award.
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:51.260]   And then you get 100 nights to try it.
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.260]   100 nights.
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.020]   And if you don't like it, no problem.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:57.060]   They'll come and get it and take it away and refund you every penny.
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:59.100]   It costs you nothing.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.860]   Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards.
[01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:06.100]   You can tell, by the way, when you open the box, it's a very compact box and your mattress
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:08.660]   comes out and it smells fabulous and it breathes.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:10.660]   It is the best mattress for hot summer nights.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:11.660]   It's cool.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.020]   It's made in the USA.
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.020]   Shipping is free.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:17.660]   Returns are free in the US or Canada.
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:18.660]   It's an amazing mattress.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.900]   What do you do with your old mattress though?
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:24.260]   Well, there's a great article in the New York Times, actually.
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:27.260]   Interesting that you should ask this Sunday.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:31.180]   What they did is they bought mattresses and they returned them.
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:35.620]   In most cases, now this was the problem was they didn't have Manhattan, where it's hard
[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:37.700]   to find charities to take mattresses.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:42.860]   But in most cases, they try to find a charity, a homeless center, that kind of thing.
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:44.100]   They don't resell it.
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:47.300]   They just give it to the charity, which is, I think, kind of cool.
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:50.380]   In any event, it's off your hands and you've got your money back.
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:51.380]   I don't think you're going to return anything.
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.380]   You're going to love it.
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:55.500]   No, I'm thinking, when you replace your mattress, like I've got a king-sized mattress.
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.500]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:58.420]   If I were to buy something, the store would take away the old one.
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:00.140]   I wonder what I would do with my old mattress.
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:01.980]   If I don't take it, I don't know.
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:03.780]   If they'll take it, will they take mattress?
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:04.780]   Sure.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:06.780]   I'm trying to steam them.
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:07.780]   Maybe.
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:11.420]   Maybe you could just not move your mattress when you move and get a casper at a new place.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:12.420]   Do you know?
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:13.420]   Uh-huh.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:14.420]   Oh.
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:15.660]   One of our audience members is bringing.
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:17.820]   You just stack it up like the princess in the pee.
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:18.820]   Oh, because more comfortable.
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:20.820]   He's at the launch yourself on sitting back.
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:21.820]   Well, you need a ladder.
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:23.820]   Don't fall off.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:26.860]   Go to Casper.com right now.
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:31.860]   You'll get $50 off your mattress purchase if you go to Casper.com/twit and use the promo
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:32.860]   code "twit."
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:36.060]   It's already a great deal on a mattress that's going to be even better.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:38.460]   You can use your old mattresses to line your VR room walls.
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:39.460]   There you go.
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.180]   You can bounce off the walls.
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.180]   I like it.
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:43.540]   My studio to absorb the sound.
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.540]   Perfect.
[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:46.540]   Actually, the Casper would be great for that.
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:47.540]   Casper.com/twit.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:48.540]   $50.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:49.540]   You can sleep on the wall.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:50.540]   You're doing it.
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.940]   Hey, we've had a lot of fun.
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:53.940]   I don't know.
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:56.940]   Do we cover every story you guys care about?
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:59.780]   Um, I think we got it all.
[01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:04.500]   I'm just looking at this US tech firms, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter, urging Congress
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:11.020]   to support the government's plan to give control of the DNS system to ICANN.
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:13.860]   I thought there, I guess the Commerce Department still has oversight.
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:16.820]   I thought that that happened years ago.
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:23.260]   ICANN will be in charge of the non-profit ICANN.
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:25.660]   Oh, I see.
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:33.420]   Will go out of the Commerce Department's control October 1st unless Congress votes otherwise.
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:35.260]   There's this whole conspiracy theory.
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:39.140]   The UN wants to take over and the Russians and blah, blah, blah.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:42.260]   No country should control the internet.
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:44.020]   I think this is appropriate.
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:47.380]   This is controlling, not even the plumbing, but the way we name the plumbing.
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:48.940]   It is the most boring.
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:50.300]   I mean, I've been to ICANN meetings.
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:52.700]   It is the most tedious and boring thing.
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:56.860]   If the UN wants to take it over, if the Russians want to take it over, I mean, it doesn't control
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.860]   content.
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:01.460]   I mean, obviously, we don't want any government controlling where we can go on the internet.
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.460]   But I think the internet is a global medium.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:09.140]   The US government doesn't make sense for the US Department of Commerce to control that.
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:14.220]   I mean, the only way to think about that is that, is it broken now?
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:15.220]   Right.
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:16.220]   Kind of a big deal.
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:17.220]   Is it broken?
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.220]   Is it working?
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.220]   It seems to work.
[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.220]   Right.
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.980]   So there's an argument to not screw around with it.
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:22.980]   Right.
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:24.580]   And giving it to the UN is screwing around with something.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:29.580]   Well, no, I mean, what they're really saying is technically the US has some authority.
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:32.580]   But when we're talking about the internet, it's not pretty well under that authority.
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:36.940]   But when Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Amazon, Cloudflare, and Yahoo!
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:37.940]   All agree.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:38.940]   Yeah, it's about time.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.660]   I think we can say these guys know what they're talking about.
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:42.660]   I'm happy to--
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:43.660]   To you.
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:44.660]   --all for it.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:45.660]   I'm all for it.
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:46.660]   Hey, Phil, great to see you.
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:47.660]   Great to see you.
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:48.660]   Thank you.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:49.660]   Thanks so much for coming on the show.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:50.660]   Come back soon.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.660]   Thank you.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.660]   Anytime.
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:53.660]   What are your investments that you're really excited about?
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:54.900]   Anything you want to talk about?
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:50:02.300]   Well, my investment hypothesis is this is basically two possible futures for this world.
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:07.700]   The world can move to become more like Star Trek or the world to become more like Mad
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:08.700]   Max.
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:09.700]   I vote for Star Trek.
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:10.700]   I vote for Star Trek too.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:11.700]   Oh, me, Star Trek.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:12.700]   Yeah, and that's kind of my job.
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.060]   So I want to invest in things that make the world more like Star Trek.
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:16.060]   I love that.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:17.060]   That's great.
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:20.380]   And the other folks at Journal Catalyst are giving me enough rope to do that.
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.380]   So I'm pretty happy.
[01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:25.420]   That is a great philosophy.
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:26.940]   I support you in that.
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:27.940]   Thank you.
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:29.380]   Can we get the holodeck anytime soon?
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.980]   You know, probably in the next few years we'll have something similar.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:35.060]   Probably it'd be something you have to strap onto your face for now.
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:36.260]   Oh, I don't want to strap it on.
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:38.900]   I just want to live it.
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:44.980]   One of the things that exists in Star Trek I think is most things are much more beneficent.
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:48.740]   They're made in the interest of the people.
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:51.220]   Like mattresses in Star Trek.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:55.260]   When you buy a mattress, it's probably not this slimy thing that somebody's ripping you
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:56.260]   off.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.820]   And so actually I think something like Casper, which is not one of our best.
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.420]   It's a Star Trek fruit future.
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:03.060]   Well, it's getting us in the right direction.
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:06.620]   The idea that you can do something like buy a mattress or open a banking account without
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:10.380]   feeling that someone's ripping you off is a big deal.
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:11.380]   I agree.
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:13.300]   That's the kind of thing I'm interested in.
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:14.300]   Great to see you again.
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.300]   Come back soon.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.300]   Thank you.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:17.300]   Georgia, you're coming down here.
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:18.300]   I don't know if I'm going to be here when you're in town.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:19.300]   You're going to the Yosemite conference.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.300]   Oh, no.
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:21.300]   Really?
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.300]   I don't know.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.300]   That's really sad right now.
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:24.300]   I want to see you.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:25.300]   It's like March.
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:26.300]   March, I'll be here in March.
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:27.940]   I'll make a point.
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:28.940]   Okay, good.
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:30.500]   I'll be staying for like two weeks.
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:31.500]   I'll be in the air.
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:33.740]   At some point, I'll crash the area.
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:35.580]   Catch Georgia's work.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.500]   Of course, at imore.com.
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:40.220]   And let's not forget, is it anxiety videos?
[01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:42.500]   It's anxiety dash videos.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:43.500]   That's right.
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:44.500]   Dash.
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:45.500]   I always forget the dash.
[01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:46.500]   Yeah.
[01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:47.900]   We're dealing with anxiety, sleep issues, depression.
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:53.180]   We have some new ones on boundaries and consequences, parenting, some other stuff like that.
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:55.980]   So you want to take your therapist by trade.
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:57.740]   She's not making this stuff up.
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:51:59.300]   She's a trained professional.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:00.300]   Yes.
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:01.300]   I can see people going, well, what are you doing?
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.300]   Well, what do you know about it?
[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:04.540]   Well, she knows a lot about it.
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:08.980]   And they have some great videos that are well worth, especially the sleep video.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:10.460]   Get the sleep you've always dreamt of.
[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:11.900]   But look at all this new stuff you're doing too.
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:12.900]   That's fantastic.
[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:13.900]   Yeah.
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:14.900]   I like boundaries.
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.100]   I think boundaries are a big one.
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:21.700]   Boundaries and consequences is wonderful because it teaches you how to help other people treat
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:22.700]   you.
[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:24.300]   We teach people how to let us be treated.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.300]   Yes.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:31.100]   And so it just keeps all your relationships happy because you're not undermined or angry
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:35.180]   but not able to share that because you created a safe boundary and a consequence of someone
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.180]   walks over that.
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.180]   Right.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:38.180]   So everyone should do that.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.860]   And I don't think people think about it or talk about that at all, but that is a great
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:45.460]   way to contextualize it so that you protect yourself in a way that not only protects yourself
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:47.620]   but is responsible about your relationship so that they're good.
[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:49.620]   And it's not about just parenting.
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:52.860]   That's about love relationships, work relationships.
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:54.580]   This is something that everyone should do.
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:58.780]   And I think that very few people even know that they have a right to have a certain level
[01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:02.180]   of interaction with someone else or a consequence to that.
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:03.180]   Right.
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:06.020]   I love this comment in the chat room from Dr. Wigs.
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:07.500]   Oh, that Georgia Dow.
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:08.500]   I've got that bookmark.
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:09.500]   I didn't know you were on Twitter.
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:11.500]   Yes, that Georgia Dow.
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:14.500]   Not just A Georgia Dow, the Georgia Dow.
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:15.980]   What other Georgia Dow is he following?
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.300]   I guess there must be others.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:18.300]   He's the mother one.
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:19.300]   There must be others.
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:20.600]   I'm also going to be speaking at Coco Love.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.600]   It's our last Coco Love.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.540]   And I'm going to be the keynote speaker and I'm going to be talking about helping people
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:27.540]   get more connected.
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:28.900]   And that's Coco Love.
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:29.900]   I love the name.
[01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:30.900]   You're going to love.
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:31.900]   Yeah.
[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:33.740]   Is there Coco involved?
[01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.460]   There probably will probably be Coco there.
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:37.460]   Where is that in Montreal?
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:39.180]   That's going to be in Philadelphia.
[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:44.020]   And I think that the tickets are on sale until the 23rd of September and it's October
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:45.020]   14th to 16th.
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:46.020]   And it's a lot of fun.
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:47.660]   I might be in Philadelphia that week.
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:48.660]   Really?
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.220]   I'm planning a conference.
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:52.740]   I'm putting an event on February 7th in Philadelphia.
[01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:54.740]   So, say for you, it's going to be this year.
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:55.740]   It's the city of Georgia.
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:57.340]   I'll just there on Thursday.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:58.340]   It's lovely.
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.340]   Lovely city.
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:00.340]   Oh, and I love doing conferences.
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:03.140]   So, everyone should go to a conference if you've never gone to conferences before.
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:04.380]   Well, this is another, this is like Yosemite.
[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:05.380]   This is another Apple conference.
[01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:06.380]   Exactly.
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:08.940]   Go to the Constitution Museum right across from the Liberty Bell.
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:09.940]   It is awesome.
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:10.940]   Oh, wow.
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:11.940]   Oh, really?
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:16.340]   You know what's cool about this is with the demise of Macworld Expo, all of these independent,
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:19.500]   wonderful, very personal events have sprung up.
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:20.500]   But I think that's...
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.260]   In some ways, that's better than having one centralized event.
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:25.860]   Oh, Macworld Expo turned out to iPhone case Expo.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:26.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:27.860]   That's the last few years or so.
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:28.860]   Oh, my God.
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:29.860]   A new iPhone case.
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:30.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:31.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:32.860]   Good.
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:33.860]   All right.
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:34.860]   Cocolove.org.
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:41.140]   Larry Maggid, you'll find him at connect safely.org or safe kids.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:42.140]   Or Larryworld.com.
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.140]   Or Larryworld.com.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:44.860]   And of course, regularly on CBS Radio.
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:45.860]   Thank you.
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:48.060]   You've heard that voice over and over.
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:49.060]   Oh, God.
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:50.060]   It gets so tedious.
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:51.060]   I was replacing it.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:53.260]   It was a sad percent ago and I hear you all the time.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:54.980]   Every day at 350 in the afternoon.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:58.340]   Must be when I just get off the air or something because I hear you every day.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:54:59.340]   And you do a great job.
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:00.900]   Thank you, Lou.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:02.060]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:08.900]   We do this week in tech on Sunday afternoons, 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern time, 2200 UTC.
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:11.180]   You can always watch live at Twit.TV.
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:13.660]   But you can also get on-demand audio and video after the fact.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:15.300]   You can also be in the studio.
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:17.580]   What a great studio audience.
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:19.060]   You guys are fabulous.
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:23.380]   Not a peep out of you the whole time.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:26.420]   Because tickets at Twit.TV will put a chair out for you.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:31.100]   And if you can't make it in studio or watching on the stream, you can always get it on demand.
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:34.700]   Because every one of our shows is available for download at Twit.TV.
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:37.700]   Or wherever you get your podcasts.
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:40.340]   Next week, Karsten, who's filling in for me next week?
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:41.340]   Jason Calicanis.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:42.340]   Jason Calicanis.
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:44.740]   That'll be interesting.
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:46.340]   He's putting together his own panel.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:47.340]   Oh, boy.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:48.820]   That'll be fun.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:49.820]   Jason's the greatest.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:50.820]   We'll look forward to that.
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:55.420]   We'll have a venture, I think a venture investor focus on that one.
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:58.020]   And then the following week, is it Becky Worley is doing the show?
[01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:59.940]   Becky Worley's going to be filling in for me.
[01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:02.220]   So some great twits coming up.
[01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:05.500]   But I am headed out for adventure.
[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:09.100]   So I'm looking forward to it.
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:11.460]   My wife is saying, come on, the car's out.
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:12.460]   Your ride's waiting.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:13.460]   It's waiting.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:14.460]   It's waiting right now.
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:15.460]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:16.460]   I'll see you next time.
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:17.460]   Another Twit.
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.460]   Is it the cam?
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:19.460]   Bye-bye.
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:23.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:25.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:27.460]   Do as a twist.
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:30.040]   (upbeat music)
