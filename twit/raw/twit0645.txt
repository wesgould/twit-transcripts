[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.560]   Of course, we're gonna talk about that silly video
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.320]   that chairman of the FCC made to defend his rulings
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.320]   on net neutrality, the new $5,000 IMac Pro,
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.680]   the Disney Murdoch deal, and the Fire TV hack.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.720]   That's all coming up next.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.440]   On Twi-

[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.040]   this weekend tech, the show where we get together
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.840]   with some of the most interesting tech journalists
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.360]   in the country and talk and chew over
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.680]   to the fat over the tech news of the week on my left.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.960]   The technologizer, Harry McCracken
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.720]   always a thrill to have Harry on the show.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.160]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.000]   - Great to be here.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.840]   - Been a while.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.680]   I've been enjoying, as I said,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.000]   I've been enjoying your Twitter.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.760]   - Remember to plug Fast Company though?
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.680]   - Oh yes, now on Fast Company.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.360]   Fast Company.com.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   We don't have as low or third up.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   Let's put up a lower third
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.840]   so you get a special billboard.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.680]   There you go.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.520]   - Ta-da!
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.360]   - There you go.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.400]   @Harry McCracken on the Twitter.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.360]   Haven't seen Dan Gilmore in ages.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.120]   Dan is a great journalist.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.880]   It was a long time at the San Jose Mercury News.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.480]   Now is kind of promoting citizen journalism.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.800]   And where are you these days?
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.680]   - At the moment, I'm home in the Bay Area.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.480]   - Oh, welcome back.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.320]   - Yeah, I am part of the faculty
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.960]   at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   and Mass Communication at Arizona State,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.440]   where I go periodically and working on new project
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.720]   that's called the News CoLab to do experiments
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.560]   to help improve essentially the place
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.240]   where supply and demand meet and the demand side too.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.880]   It could be really really fun.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.360]   - I have to say this year is really hit home for me
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.760]   how important journalism is,
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.840]   how important the fourth estate is.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.320]   The fourth branch of government is more than ever.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   And I think it's actually been a, believe it or not,
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.560]   a good year for journalism.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.000]   But it's also important year for us to solve these
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.360]   thorny problems of how to make journalism work
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.760]   in the internet age.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.120]   - Jan, how to make us the audience work better too.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.880]   - Yeah, we might need a little help there as well.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.960]   - Yeah.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.680]   - And speaking of people who need help,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.800]   Owen J.J. Stonodakta is here
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.120]   by qmz.com.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.680]   Hey J.J.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.400]   - Hey, so first of all, I'll shout out to the chat room
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.560]   always a bunch of great people.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.720]   And my wall art is coming back.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.760]   I just painted the walls.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.600]   I got new wall.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.440]   So wall art's coming back.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.280]   Don't worry about that.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.640]   And I'll be changing up every episode of one next year.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.040]   Secondly, Leo, just so you know upfront,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.280]   so it's on record.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.200]   Every time you throw to me for a statement,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.680]   there's going to be a $2.25 charge.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.000]   I got to get ahead on this SEC thing.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   So I'm trying to bank up some money.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.520]   Anybody who comes to my house,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.080]   you want the Wi-Fi password?
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.240]   That's going to be a $10 charge also.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.880]   Okay, if you share the Wi-Fi password or somebody else,
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.840]   you're responsible for their $10 charge.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.680]   I'm just putting it out there to the public.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.080]   So everybody knows the rules.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   - You got to make a profit.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.920]   - You got to make a profit.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.760]   - Hey, I'm just saying completely.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.800]   - It's not about making a profit.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.200]   I just got to pay for this Netflix.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   May start slowing me down,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.000]   start charging me extra Facebook.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.680]   I got to start early, Uncle Leo.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.920]   We got to give this a swap.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.000]   - So of course, Thursday or Friday,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Thursday I think it was the FCC passed the long expected
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.440]   revoke revocation of the net neutrality regulation
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.760]   that had been put in place in 2015.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.720]   The title to regulation and basically turned back
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.480]   the clock on net neutrality.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   It's been interesting to watch the reaction.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.080]   And it does, just as the vote did,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.320]   it does kind of break down along party lines.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.200]   There are a lot of people,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.040]   I even had a conversation on the radio show today
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.760]   with somebody who said,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.120]   but you don't want the government to regulate the internet.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.040]   And of course you don't,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.480]   but that's not what we're talking about.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.600]   We're talking about the government
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.400]   regulating internet service providers.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.320]   And I think maybe part of this is kind of,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.080]   part of it is ideological.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.440]   I mean, there are certainly people
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.640]   who don't want regulation,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.960]   don't like government regulation.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.640]   I can understand that.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.840]   In fact, I remember the debates
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.920]   that the Electronic Frontier Foundation had over whether,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.960]   they would come out in favor of a regulation,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.600]   of a title to regulation of the internet
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.920]   because there are certainly people on the board there
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.160]   who thought that no government intervention
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   in the internet was needed or necessary.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.200]   But I loved Larry Lessig's tweet.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.440]   I'm gonna see if I can find it because,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.640]   I think he kind of crystallized it for me.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.580]   And certainly Larry has the standing to comment on this.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.080]   Let's see, he's @lessig on the Twitter.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.360]   Let me see if I can find his tweet here
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.960]   'cause I think it was a good response to people say,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.400]   "Well, but wait a minute,
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.520]   "we don't need government regulation.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   "We haven't had it for years, the net did just fine."
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.880]   He made the point that, well, we have had net neutrality.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.280]   The net was born neutral and there it is.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   There are plenty of laws protecting net neutrality from day one.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.960]   He was responding to Ted Cruz's statement
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.880]   which I think reflects accurately
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.480]   the conservative point of view on it.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.000]   Let me see if I can find it so I can read it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I see it on the screen but I don't have it here.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.920]   Did I skip by it?
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.000]   He's been very active.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.080]   There it is.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.720]   Ted said snowflake, believing online propaganda.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.520]   Here he quotes the quote, snowflake,
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.640]   "OMG, without net neutrality, the internet is gone.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.960]   "Informed observer," says Ted Cruz, apparently.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.600]   "Ted, you know the FCC issued that rule in 2015.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.000]   "The internet grew up wonderfully free
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.280]   "of government regulation
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.720]   "and this restores the status quo."
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.760]   Snowflake, nevermind.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.200]   It's kind of nice Ted can have conversations with himself
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.880]   in which everything works out well.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.840]   But Larry pointed out that the ignorance in this tweet
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.720]   is astonishing.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.560]   The net was born neutral from the beginning.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.360]   The FCC and others fought to keep it neutral.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.120]   The 2015 rules assured its neutrality.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.760]   Then the clueless or corrupt took that protection away.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.800]   If you think that there is reasonable argument
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.440]   for some government regulation,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.960]   keep the water safe, the air safe to make sure
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.360]   that the butcher's scale delivers a pound of hamburger
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.640]   for a pound of hamburger and not three quarters of a pound
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.440]   or the gas pump gives you a full gallon
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.560]   when you think you're paying for a gallon.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.240]   Then you might agree that we need people
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.120]   to keep an eye on businesses like the internet service
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.840]   providers to make sure that they follow the rules.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.960]   I think of the FCC as a referee representing our interests
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.000]   in the face of business.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.880]   Whose interests face it are to make money?
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.040]   And that's how we want it.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.600]   We want businesses to be profit focused.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.580]   What went wrong?
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.520]   Why are we sitting here with something
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.440]   that has been protected since day one on the internet gone?
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.280]   Let me, I'll start with you, Harry.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.280]   And by the way, if you think my analysis of this
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.120]   is mistaken, please set me straight.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.040]   - Well, we have a chair of the FCC
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.320]   who was opposed to the 2015 law.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.440]   I mean, that's the most fundamental--
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.400]   - So what happened was we hadn't had a rally.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.840]   The Verizon sued the FCC saying,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.400]   "You don't have the standing to do this.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.960]   "Congress didn't give you permission to do this."
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.080]   And the courts were very conveniently said
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.600]   that the judge almost whispered it.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.520]   By the way, you have the authority,
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.240]   but only if you declare that internet service providers,
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.960]   broadband providers are common carriers.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.600]   You can regulate common carriers.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.200]   You have to declare them common carriers
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.280]   using Title II of the Telecommunications Act.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.360]   So the FCC went back, debated it.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.960]   Remember, we had big comment session.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.120]   And I think at first, Tom Wheeler,
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120]   who was the chairman of the FCC,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.600]   didn't like this idea, was Republican,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.520]   didn't like this idea, but he was convinced,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.120]   okay, Title II regulation,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.960]   that's the tool we have as the FCC.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.360]   We're gonna do something we call light touch regulation.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.080]   We're not gonna take advantage of all the features
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.680]   of Title II, but we are gonna use it
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.520]   to ensure net neutrality past that 2015.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.720]   And that's been the law of the land.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.880]   But there have been previous things.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.760]   In fact, prior to that, I remember AT&T got us,
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.320]   got a fine from the FCC because they blocked FaceTime.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   - There were several cases.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.360]   There was a ISP that prevented Vonage,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.560]   telephony calls from going on its network,
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.040]   and they got in trouble too.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.280]   We were very concerned, was that companies would use
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.600]   their position as an internet service provider
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.280]   to block competitors, or to try to extract more money
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.120]   by saying, we're gonna charge Google or Netflix more money
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.920]   to reach our subscribers, a toll road,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.680]   to prioritize traffic in some way.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.560]   And so the idea was that the FCC's the referee
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.160]   in this matter, and we'll try to keep that fair.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.400]   - And the case for this not being a disaster
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.760]   is if companies that do that sort of thing,
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.440]   and abuse their power do get in trouble,
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.120]   'cause there aren't any trust issues
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.560]   with things like AT&T preventing
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.400]   a competitive service from running.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.800]   - Sure, if you have any trust regulation.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.000]   Chairman Pai said we're gonna have
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.720]   the FTC monitor net neutrality going forward.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.680]   The FTC said we don't have the technical chops to do this.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.400]   We have an enforcement arm.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.480]   The FTC could step in if an internet service provider says,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.360]   you're gonna get 20 megabits down and you only get 10.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.560]   That's unfair advertising.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.200]   But there's a lot of technical behind the scenes stuff.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.640]   - Right, and that is the scary thing is
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.400]   there might be stuff we just don't know about happening.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.480]   And Pai's video, which he made,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.680]   which I assume we'll talk about.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.520]   - We're gonna play.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.760]   - And a glassed over the stuff that we need to be concerned
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.560]   about and suggested that if Instagram works,
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.240]   then there's no issue here, which is not true at all.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.600]   - Yeah, I mean, it's very easy.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.360]   Well, this is frankly, I found this the most insulting thing.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.400]   - It was really patronizing, and he came off as a total bozo.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.280]   This is a AgiPai seven things you can still do
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.680]   on the internet after net neutrality.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.600]   He's holding a Fidget Spinner, a gun.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.440]   - I'm a jee-pie.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   I'm the chairman of the FTC.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.560]   Recently, there's been quite a bit of conversation
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.000]   about my plan to restore internet freedom.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.520]   Here are just a few of the things that are--
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.600]   - Wait a minute, let me pause for a moment.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.520]   Internet freedom is restoring internet freedom?
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.880]   That's good news.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.920]   I'm in favor of internet freedom.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.880]   It's actually the freedom for internet service providers
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.720]   to do well in the whole world.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.920]   - It's not Verizon and ATMT and Comcast.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.240]   - No, our freedom, their freedom, okay.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.720]   - People just do things on the internet.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.200]   After these Obama era regulations are repealed.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.240]   - Oh, by the way, they love using the Obama name.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.840]   And that's one of the reasons that a lot of people think,
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.920]   oh, this is from 2015.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.200]   This has been the status quo forever,
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.360]   as Larry Lessig pointed out.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.680]   This is not Obama era.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.480]   Painting it with the Obama brushes a way to get some people
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.400]   to say, oh yeah, we want to get rid of that.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.240]   - I am your food.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.480]   - You can still Instagram your food, or I'm sorry.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.520]   You can gram your food.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.840]   - He's so hip, he's so wither he uses the food.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.040]   - You can still gram your food.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.880]   - What though?
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.480]   Does anybody call it gramming?
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.760]   Anybody?
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.280]   You know what, it's really offensive?
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.720]   Government, our tax dollars were spent
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.840]   to make this propaganda crap.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.200]   - Well, it was on the Daily Caller site, I think.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   I'm not sure who paid for it.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.640]   - Well, maybe the Daily Caller paid for it.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.480]   - I'm not sure.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.640]   I mean, he had to take his time to make this.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.440]   - Let's point out, we are paying Adjut probably a salary
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.720]   to put Sriracha on his Cheetos.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.560]   - It's disgusting.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.400]   - It's quality.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.680]   - Right, real selfie, or just a...
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.040]   - So insult.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.960]   - You can still post photos of cute animals.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.800]   Like puppies.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.960]   (crowd groans)
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.360]   (laughs)
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.160]   - You can still shop for all your Christmas presents online.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.000]   - Yes.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.560]   - Got the bulk deal in Fidget Spinners.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.160]   - Is that a Chromebook?
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.000]   All right, just check.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.360]   - Yes, those eclipse glasses are so cheap.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.640]   - Oh Lord.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.840]   Isn't this what you want your elected officials?
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.280]   He's not elected, he's appointed to look like on the holidays.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.000]   If I didn't think Adjut Pie was an ass before,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.280]   I really think he's an ass now.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.000]   - Yeah, he just spent that amount of time
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.640]   trying to make a serious case for his stance.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.480]   - Yeah.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.040]   - And you know, Ben Thompson gave the best case I saw
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.400]   for this potentially not being a disaster.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.640]   But he's one of the few people I was saying
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.480]   who actually knows what he's talking about,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.320]   who...
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.080]   Ben...
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.920]   - He knew it with a somewhat open mind.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.720]   - Ben realized that he used the wrong headline for his article.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.360]   He said why Adjut Pie is right.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.800]   And he actually wanted to change that afterwards.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.720]   - And Ben's piece is long and complicated
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.560]   and then full of a subtle...
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.640]   - I could sum it up.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.840]   Ben's piece says, if there's competition,
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.800]   you don't need the FCC to referee this.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.400]   - And there's not enough competition in this country.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.240]   - There's not.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.080]   - In this country.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.560]   - And Ben's in China.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.840]   Maybe he doesn't understand that.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.400]   Dan, what do you think of all this?
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.640]   What's your opinion?
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.840]   - Oh God, the insult to your intelligence
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.080]   that this represents when people like Pie
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.920]   make these statements that are just false.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.480]   What's at stake here is really, really pretty simple.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.960]   And that's going to be who decides
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.800]   what bits of information get to your devices
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.200]   and my devices and the public's devices
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.080]   in what order, at what speed,
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.480]   or whether they get there at all.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.560]   Do you decide, do we decide out here?
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.560]   Or does Comcast decide?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.320]   Or Verizon, or Time Warner Cable,
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   or whatever they're called now.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.440]   That is really what's at stake.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   And as of this week, barring court overturning it,
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.920]   and certainly Congress won't,
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   it's the internet companies, the carriers
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.560]   that will be able to make those decisions.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.960]   And I think one of the problems with all this
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.360]   is that it has become partisan,
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.720]   and that's just mysterious.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.240]   Because I would have thought Republicans
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.800]   would favor a world of competition,
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.600]   and now they're voting for a world of no competition.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.920]   Because in a lot of places,
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.480]   there is absolutely none,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.080]   or at most two real competitors in a market.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.520]   It's very, very puzzling.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.720]   And we're going to, over time,
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.520]   I think see some terrible impacts from this.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.120]   And it's a bad day.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.800]   - And Ben says, we should,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.560]   I mean, I really want to clear Ben's name.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.760]   Because he's not against this.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   - He's not a price empathetic.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.280]   - Nor is he, he says, allow me to state this point plainly,
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.240]   I'm absolutely in favor of net neutrality.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.280]   To believe Chairman Pia's right is not
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.520]   to be against net neutrality,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.240]   rather is to believe that the FCC's 2015 approach
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.080]   was mistaken.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.800]   Now, I think Ben's misunderstanding
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.200]   what Agit Pia's agenda is.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.960]   It's not to change Title II regulation.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.280]   And by the way, I think it's safe to say we all agree
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.960]   that there's no question that broadband providers
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.320]   are not information services,
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   that they are in fact, title to style carriers, right?
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.000]   - Well Comcast certainly thinks that's an information
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.560]   provider because they're buying all these movie studios
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.240]   and TV networks and so forth.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.600]   - Yeah, well that does muddy the waters,
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.000]   but to the degree that they are in that position,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.160]   that makes them even more of a danger because
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.400]   they are now both playing both sides.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.040]   They're competing with YouTube.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.240]   - And AT&T would like to be a content owner.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.080]   - Right.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.400]   - They'd like to own Time Warner.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.240]   So yes, it totally is.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.080]   - Is that what this is about?
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   - Is that these guys are becoming content providers
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.040]   and they want to kind of tilt the plane fuel.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.360]   - That's part of why it's so dangerous
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.600]   because they are competing with the other companies
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.320]   who's a bit so they are delivering
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.560]   and they have a much larger conflict of interest.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   If they'd much rather you watched their streaming service
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.640]   then Netflix or YouTube.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.480]   - Yeah.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.680]   All right, I've saved the best for last.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.760]   - I'm sure O doctor is completely in favor of a vagit pie
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.960]   and what he's up to, right, Owen?
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.440]   - I am 1,000% in love with that man.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.320]   First of all, no flake.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.440]   That video is not meant for me.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.560]   So it doesn't insult me.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.720]   It doesn't make me feel bad.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.960]   That's a marketing ploy to pander to doofuses
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   that will believe him.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.800]   That's not me.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.720]   That's not the base I usually identify as a player.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.400]   - You know, Graham, your sriracha Cheetos?
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.040]   - I don't even know why that means you feel
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.280]   any which way but loose.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.440]   I mean if you are, then you're too worried
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.600]   about Instagram if that made you feel some sort of way.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.960]   Who cares about that video?
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.440]   That video, that statement,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.880]   it's marketing to people that don't know any better.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.240]   I personally understand one that this was a vote and a change.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.400]   You can appoint another chairman when you get another president
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.520]   and you could change things again.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.000]   So maybe you have to suffer for a few years
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.160]   but legally things could change and happen.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.520]   So it's not like this is the last thing
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.800]   that's ever been done on the internet
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.680]   and it's the way it's gonna be for the rest of time.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.320]   I personally appreciate this administration.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.360]   I appreciate moves like this
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.600]   and I'm gonna give you the perfect example why.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.320]   I have a friend, I'm not gonna say his name,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.760]   went to high school with him.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.440]   He is a pothead, works hard, got three kids, great guy
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.680]   but he just likes to play video games to smoke weed
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.760]   and take care of his family.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.880]   Now he's researching net neutrality, FCC.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.560]   He's reading articles and calling me.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.240]   He knows about the budget, the tax bill.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.960]   He knows about the education bill.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.040]   This is a guy who wasn't registered to vote until this year.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.840]   35 years old, he's lived his life,
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.080]   never voted for anybody, never read nothing,
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.520]   never cared about nothing.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.720]   Now, this person, like a lot of people are like,
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.760]   whoa, whoa, whoa, because now this administration is so,
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.280]   the news is about political shows
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.520]   I'm trying to make it real simple.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.720]   This administration wears its heart on the sleeves
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.440]   when past administrations, they screw you over a little bit
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.440]   but they were smart about it and they pat you on the back,
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.000]   make you feel good, see you, accept things.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.280]   This administration is a bulldozer that is for sale
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.840]   and people can see that it's blatantly for sale.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.320]   And so now more people that are regular average Americans
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.960]   wanna know what's going on because when you see net neutrality
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.520]   and internet, people that would have never cared before
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.600]   now care because they're like, whoa, wait, what?
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.560]   So personally, like I said, I'm not super worried about it.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.480]   I'm just gonna charge my $10 fee when you come to my house,
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.160]   start stacking up these chips just in case they start messing up
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.240]   because again, people don't understand when they say,
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   oh, oh, and there's competition.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.600]   I live in a small town.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.800]   I just moved to cross town.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.440]   This town is the smallest town in New Jersey.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.840]   On the other side of town, I had Fios and Verizon.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.040]   I always had Verizon.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.000]   I moved over here.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.480]   There's nothing but Comcast.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.520]   I can't, like, I can barely even get dish network out here
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.200]   because they just don't come out here
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.080]   because nobody has it.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.240]   Everybody has Comcast.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.760]   So some places don't even have two options
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.200]   in any part of their town.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.600]   That's the difference with cell phones.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.040]   Cell phones, yeah.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.240]   Everybody started giving out free unlimited internet
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.760]   because anybody could go get anybody's cell phone.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.920]   That's what competition is.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.960]   They're like, oh, man, everybody's moving to T-Mobile
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.240]   'cause they're giving away Netflix and free internet for $40.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   Next thing you know, for Verizon
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.720]   who's been killing people for years,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.320]   it's like, all right, we'll give you a crappy
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.800]   unlimited 45-hour plans.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.640]   Are happy?
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.480]   You make you happy?
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.200]   So, like I said, I'm super excited about these times.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.680]   I'm not that worried about it.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.080]   I'm not that upset about it.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.560]   That video is amusing to me, but it doesn't upset me
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   because I have faith in the future.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.280]   I like the fact that people are route up.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.880]   I like the fact that people care.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.680]   And when they care, they vote.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.720]   And when you talk about Republicans,
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.920]   Republicans do what they get paid to do.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.320]   What lobbyists tell them to do is what they do.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.040]   Parties and principals have changed.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.480]   They're not what they used to be.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.400]   Now we are a country of funding.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.280]   And when you get funding, that's what you buy by.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.040]   So, let's cut out the funds.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.880]   Let's cut out these votes.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.720]   - I agree, yes, I agree.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.080]   - If we can change anything, we wanna change.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.680]   - Long term, the only, and by the way,
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.480]   it's not just Republicans, Democrats take plenty
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.320]   of money from the trough.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.200]   - Oh, yeah, no, no, I'm just saying.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.480]   - I think the only, and by the way, Larry Lessig,
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.560]   who we were quoting early on, feels the same way.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.560]   Remember, Larry was, he ran for president in 2016.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   Didn't really do very well.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.480]   But he had for a long time been campaigning
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.960]   against digital rights management, copy protection
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.160]   on music and so forth.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.000]   And he realized he's never gonna get anything done
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.520]   in Congress ever unless we got campaign finance reform.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.880]   We need to get money out of politics.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.760]   So he ran for president in 2016
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.240]   on the strangest platform ever.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.640]   He said, "If I get the nomination,
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.680]   "I will pick a really good vice president,
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.160]   "somebody who should run the country, not me.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.880]   "My only job, my only, if I get elected,
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.520]   "day one, I will do campaign finance reform.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.040]   "You're never gonna get the people who benefit
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.320]   "from the current campaign finance laws to change them."
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.200]   And of course, that's Congress.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.160]   He said, "I will do campaign finance reform,
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.520]   "revisine, let the very good vice president run the country,
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.320]   "but we will have made a huge difference
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.240]   "by taking the influence of money out of politics."
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.640]   I don't know how doable that is.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.040]   I doubt it'll happen in my lifetime.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.440]   But I guess the one thing,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.520]   I like it that you're an optimist, Owen,
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.440]   and I guess the one thing that's optimistic about all this
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.920]   is exactly, you're exactly right,
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.800]   is that all money buys you as votes.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.880]   The reason politicians need to raise money
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.480]   is they need to campaign for votes.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.800]   The ultimate currency here is not dollars.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.720]   The ultimate currency is your vote.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.320]   And if more people vote, more people become informed,
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.080]   and more people participate,
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   then I don't have nearly the worry that we have today.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.400]   I agree with you, Owen.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.720]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.960]   - So if you're a person who said,
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.720]   "Oh, I'm not worried about this,"
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.120]   and you campaigned on it,
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.280]   then the next time your election comes up,
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.120]   people are gonna be like,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.280]   "Hey, they're charged me 35 hours a month for Facebook."
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.360]   And you back this?
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.840]   No, you're out.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.200]   Whoever you are, you're out.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.360]   So again, this is a situation
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.800]   that I fully believe will fix itself.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.840]   - I hope you're right, I do.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.600]   You agree, Dan, you think it's all gonna be better in two years?
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.560]   (Dan laughs)
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.400]   - No.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.080]   (Dan laughs)
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.600]   I think it's gonna be a lot worse in two years,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.800]   but the part I agree with is that
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.560]   some of the stuff's getting people to pay attention,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.160]   which a lot of the people weren't,
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.560]   but you can lock a lot of bad stuff into place
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.400]   in a real hurry,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.440]   and watch what, for example,
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.760]   the administration and the Republican party
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.880]   are doing with judges.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.480]   They're locking in a generation or two
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.040]   of extreme right-wing judiciary,
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.120]   which is not likely to be on the side
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.920]   of things that we're talking about.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   So I'm optimistic only in that one level,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.960]   but I think we're in for some pretty difficult times ahead.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.200]   - Well, we need to, this is our opportunity.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.680]   This is our moment, our Hamiltonian moment.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.240]   All right, enough, we've talked about it,
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.200]   I had to bring it up.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.520]   I think certainly we've made our case,
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.160]   you need to make up your own mind,
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.680]   but I think we've made a strong case for why we believe
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.400]   that there needs to be somebody playing referee
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.760]   in this game,
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.620]   and getting rid of the referees is not the answer.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.080]   Letting the ISPs, the broadband providers,
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.440]   decide what's good and what's not
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.120]   is not the answer by any means.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.520]   We'll be back, lots more to talk about
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.560]   in just a second, great panel.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.400]   Harry McCracken, the technologizer from FastCompany.com.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.280]   Great to have you from the Walter Cronkite School
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.440]   of Journalism, Mr. Dan Gilmore, legendary, Dan Gilmore.com,
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.640]   G-I-L-L-M-O-R.com.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.200]   And it's nice to have you in the Bay Area.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.480]   So do you spend most of your time in Arizona,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.560]   or you come--
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.040]   No, no, I've been here pretty much all along.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.960]   Yeah, I go there part time.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.000]   So it's kind of an honorary position.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.840]   You don't have to.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.400]   No, I do a lot of work.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.240]   Okay, okay.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.680]   I want a job like that.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.760]   I'm gonna move to Hawaii,
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.680]   and I'll just phone the shows in everybody.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.520]   You don't mind, do you?
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.920]   No, I can stay there.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.600]   Oh, and J.J. Stone, he is also here,
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.080]   even though he wants everyone to know,
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.000]   he is not on medication.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.320]   No, I'm good.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.640]   He's suffering along with us.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.240]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.360]   from Quick and Loans.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.920]   I know that interest rates are starting to go up.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.600]   The Fed has raised him a quarter of a point.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.840]   I think they said they're gonna do that three more times
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.880]   next year.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   Maybe it's a good time to look at refinancing your house,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.800]   lock in that low interest rate you've got,
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.520]   or even a lower interest rate.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.320]   Maybe you ready to buy a home.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.080]   Excuse me, now's a good time to do that.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.440]   And either way, I want you to remember this,
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.440]   rocketmortgage.com/twit2bookmarket.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.840]   Save the day.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.920]   Put a little post-it note on your screen.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.880]   Because when you buy a house,
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.920]   the biggest purchase you're ever gonna make,
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.440]   you're gonna get a mortgage,
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.520]   unless you're doing really well,
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.960]   in which case you don't need this ad.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.840]   So you can just go have a cigar and burn some money.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.320]   But if you're gonna get a loan to buy a new house,
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.080]   you wanna make it, you're a geek,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.680]   you wanna make it easy, you wanna make it fast,
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.720]   you wanna make it simple,
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.640]   you wanna get the right loan for you.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.760]   And that's how rocketmortgage works.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.160]   It's created by quick and loans,
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.360]   best blender in the country.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.960]   Number one in customer satisfaction,
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.560]   on mortgage approval, mortgage servicing.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.880]   Mortgage approval, eight years running.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.960]   They just got the JD Power customer satisfaction,
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.240]   number one award again this year.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.560]   I think that's awesome.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.200]   And because they're so technological,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.800]   they're very savvy company.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.600]   They realized that the mortgage process
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.800]   was really kind of in 19th century.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.040]   They thought we need a technological revolution
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.520]   that's client focused, that's easier,
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.640]   and they created rocket mortgage.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.200]   You can do everything online,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.680]   you don't have to go to the bank,
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.800]   you don't have to go to the attic and get paperwork,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.240]   you don't have to find your pay stubs,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.920]   your check statements, all of it can be done on the phone.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.880]   And because it's computerized,
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.080]   literally on the phone, in a browser on the phone,
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.160]   it's computerized, it's very easy for you.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.760]   Answer some basic questions you know the answer to.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.040]   They have trusted relationships
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.040]   with all the financial institutions,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.760]   so they can get all the information they need.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.720]   They'll crunch the numbers,
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.240]   and literally within minutes,
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.680]   come back based on your income,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.400]   assets, and credit with the right loans for you.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.920]   You choose the down payment,
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.880]   you choose the interest rate,
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.280]   you choose the term, you're approved, that fast.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.760]   This is how you wanna do it.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.280]   And by the way, they've got great rates.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.320]   I was talking to somebody yesterday,
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.480]   refied through rocket mortgage,
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.400]   he said at best rate I could find anywhere.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.360]   I went to, he shopped around, shop around,
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.320]   although you won't enjoy the process.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   Rocket mortgage, from quick and loans,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.560]   that's the process you want.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.640]   Apply, simply understand fully mortgage confidently,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.040]   and if it's time to refi rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   That's rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.760]   You can actually go there and start the process
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.120]   and then pull the trigger whenever you find that house
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.960]   that you want.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.000]   Equal housing, lender licensed in all 50 states,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.520]   and MLS consumer access.org number 30, 30.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.640]   And we thank you for their support.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.840]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans,
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   rocketmortgage.com/twit, and the number two.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:58.120]   It's funny how a net neutrality has become a hot button
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.160]   for the political discussion.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.920]   I get so many tweets from people saying,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.840]   "Oh, you're wrong, it's the wrong idea."
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.680]   Even the FCC's own CTO warned that net neutrality
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.320]   would cause problems.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.840]   You saw the letter written by the 30 men and women who,
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.720]   yeah, 30 men and women who built the internet,
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.840]   who continue to run the internet saying,
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.000]   "This is a bad idea."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.840]   There's a great consensus among the didgerati.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.920]   There just doesn't seem to be a great consensus nationwide.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.000]   - But there were millions of fake people
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.400]   who contributed state-
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   - Two millions.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.760]   - This is the attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman,
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.840]   says there were two million fake accounts created on that FCC.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.880]   And who did that?
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.720]   That's what I want to know.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.560]   Where did they come from?
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.600]   - As I know, we don't know.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.240]   There is a great site you can go to the check to see
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.880]   if you're one of the fake people.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.520]   - In fact, the FCC's actually actively blocking
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.080]   Schneiderman's investigation.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.480]   They're not helping.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.040]   Which, again, this bothers me.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.720]   If this agency were acting in our interest,
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.040]   wouldn't they want to know what was going on?
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.600]   They basically ignored the comments.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.240]   They had no interest in the comments.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.920]   They didn't care what you think,
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.560]   which is also frustrating.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.400]   This week, moving on, Apple announced a $5,000 computer.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.520]   That's the starting price for the new iMac Pro,
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.120]   Slate Gray.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.560]   Did y'all order one?
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.880]   Anybody?
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.320]   - I got six of them on the run.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   (laughing)
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.680]   - It's kind of fun, actually.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.520]   You know what?
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.360]   I didn't order one.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.000]   I thought, maybe I should get one for review.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.640]   And I thought, no, they got it to Marcus Brownlee.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   I don't need to review it.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.880]   Marcus will review it.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.480]   And it really is more appropriate for people
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   who are going to edit high-def 8K video and stuff like that.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.280]   And that's pretty much who they kind of handed it out to.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.040]   - People who want 128 gigs of RAM in some cases.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:50.880]   - Yeah.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.280]   The 5K only comes with a SCAT.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.120]   What is it?
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.960]   32 gigs of RAM?
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.800]   - Meezy.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.640]   - Meezy.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.320]   Let's see, I'm just kind of curiosity.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.920]   I want to get, you can't yet get the promised 16-core.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.480]   So the most we can, let's see,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.800]   yeah, most we can do is 10 cores.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.000]   Two terabytes of storage, why not?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.120]   128 gigs of RAM, why not?
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.720]   Okay, what else can I do?
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.680]   And I'm going to beef it up because it's not the fastest,
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.560]   Zion.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.240]   Let's put it, let's get the, what's the fastest one?
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.520]   Well, this is something people should point
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.320]   at pay attention to, by the way.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.600]   The fastest Zion is cheaper, because it's 8-core.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.360]   The 10-core is 3.0 gigahertz.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.480]   That's as fast as it goes.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.320]   Which points out, this may not be the fastest
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.160]   I am at for you.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.080]   This only makes sense for somebody who's doing
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.440]   multi-core stuff like editing 8K video.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.280]   Well.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.520]   This is for the folks who spent a lot of time
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.240]   saying that Apple had basically forgotten about them
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.720]   and abandoned them.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.400]   This is part of this two step program of apples
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.360]   to show that's not true, with the second one
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.280]   being the new Mac Pro.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.000]   Which, and by the way, we don't know when that's coming.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.280]   That's what I decided, I was,
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.640]   'cause I got it up to $11,599.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.240]   And then I decided not to buy it.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.520]   But that's if you'll load it, right?
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.760]   And it's going to be even more when they have
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.440]   the newer processors available later.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.040]   So I decided I'm going to wait for the Mac Pro.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.360]   But is that a fool's errand?
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.600]   All they said about the Mac Pro is not this year.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.080]   Well, in general, I'll be interested to see
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.880]   how many super serious video editing kind of people
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.440]   went and iMac, 'cause it's historically.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.880]   They like to choose their own display
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.720]   and maybe upgrade it on a different timetable
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.680]   than the computer.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.160]   They like to expand ability.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.880]   They like being able to stick gigantic hard drives
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.800]   inside of their computer.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.480]   They liked all the stuff that the classic Mac Pro,
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.040]   the ones before this last one,
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.720]   the little trash can.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.560]   Trash can.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.920]   - I had a trash can.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.040]   It was a doorstop for a while.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.680]   And then I gave it to Nathan Oliver.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.760]   - How many people bought the trash can?
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.280]   - I mean, they're just messing up in this market.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.040]   Again, they are trying to cater
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.000]   to that certain finite group.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.280]   But I mean, for P's sake, when you look at the product itself,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.000]   like I can go put that stuff in any other machine
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.880]   for like $1.99 and they want like $8 million.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.320]   It's just, it's kind of excessive right now
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   what Apple's doing, especially when they're not offering
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.240]   something a little bit better.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.560]   I mean, again, the trash can, it looked cool,
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.360]   but it wasn't functional for the professionals
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.200]   that needed to use it.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.840]   The new MacBook Pro is a consumer book pro.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.920]   They've got emojis and little swipe things
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.760]   and touch screens and stuff.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.600]   I don't want that.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.880]   That's not what I need in a professional device.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.000]   And you want to charge three grand for it
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.400]   and you're making it for high school kids.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.040]   They're just, I don't know what's going on over there
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   right now, Apple.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:34.880]   It's really weird.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.520]   - It's not an outrageous price though.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.120]   Some people have specked out a Windows machine
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.800]   with similar specs and it was a little less expensive,
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.120]   but it wasn't hugely less expensive.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.440]   - Okay, that's true.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.400]   Windows looks a lot cheaper,
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   but the more the same you make them,
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.160]   the closer they get and Windows ends up being
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.400]   maybe a little bit cheaper.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.680]   And it's a lot of the time it's possible
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.840]   to find a Windows machine that's a little bit more expensive.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.760]   - Right.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.840]   - Yeah, it's usually the RAM that starts coming around
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.680]   with that device.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.000]   Once you start, like when you get capped out at RAM,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.160]   you can put 64, it's very comparable.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.200]   I'm just being facetious
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.520]   'cause I'm annoyed with the device.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.360]   So, don't give me--
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.600]   - We actually, you know, I mean,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.800]   we put our money where our mouth is.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.760]   We traded in our Mac Pros and got Windows,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.560]   you know, Dell Workstations running Premiere
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.120]   because we just didn't know what Apple's plans were.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.200]   This was a few years ago.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.080]   - And are you any happier or less happy?
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.480]   - Doesn't matter. - Doesn't matter.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.240]   - That's the point, right?
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.360]   It doesn't matter and it's kind of--
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.200]   - Kind of a Adobe.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.920]   - Yeah, well, I'm not thrilled with Adobe.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.960]   That's for other reasons.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.040]   Adobe seems to be going down a bad path too.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.880]   - But that's the same experience.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.680]   - It's going to be a pro, creative pro, isn't it?
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.200]   - But Adobe software is the same experience.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.160]   - Oh yeah, Premiere does everything we needed to do,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   absolutely.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.360]   I think there are people who need Final Cut Pro
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.720]   and if you do, one thing that's true,
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.840]   there's gonna be a new version of Final Cut Pro 10
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.120]   and it's gonna be tuned to work with this 10 core.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.080]   I'm at Craig Hunter who is a developer,
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.320]   he's doing an AR app called Theodolite.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.320]   Got a review unit.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.360]   This is one of the reviews that I, you know,
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.600]   kind of more trusted 'cause he did a lot of benchmarking.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.720]   He tried out computational fluid dynamics on it.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.560]   And what he found is what you would expect,
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.080]   which is that if it's a single core process,
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.520]   it's not gonna do as well.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.120]   But because it's a slower chip,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.400]   he compared it to other Macs, which, you know.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.560]   But for multi-core, you're gonna really have a huge advantage.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.080]   And so yeah, I mean, it's, if you know you need it,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.280]   then you need it and probably you're willing to pay for it
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.720]   because he points out that compilation is so much faster
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.920]   for him that 'cause he's got an app with 20 to 30,000 lines
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.280]   of code and 120 different source files.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.400]   So that makes a big, yeah,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.640]   that makes a big difference to him.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.240]   Vector processing, he did a bunch of benchmarks.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.920]   So this is a good, for people who wanna know,
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.760]   HRTapps.com.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.800]   He says his wallet burst into flames.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.320]   - Apple's PR strategy was pretty smart though.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.640]   They, they, they, they, they loan these to the people
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   who know what they're talking about.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.160]   - Not so much of the publications, right?
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.000]   - Right, right.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.840]   - After the verge of the gadget.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   - Rather than do the computer sites,
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.480]   they loan them to actual human beings who do this stuff
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.720]   and have a deep knowledge of it.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.080]   And you know, the reviews they got back were generally,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.520]   I think were fairly favorable,
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.560]   although they pointed out this was not a panacea for everybody.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.480]   But I think, but for some of the grumblers,
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.720]   that looks like it will make a difference.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.560]   - Yeah.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.520]   Every time I criticize Apple, people say,
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.360]   yeah, the most valuable company in the world,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.760]   somebody did the calculations.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   And Apple apparently makes $1,447 a second.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.320]   Is that right?
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.400]   Yeah, $1,444.76 per second,
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.560]   which in fact makes it quite profitable.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.040]   - And their revenue from these machines
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   is gonna be a rounding error,
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.440]   even if they're really successful.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.280]   - They are gonna sell that many and they don't want it.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.680]   That's not the point.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.560]   - But they probably don't like being beat up constantly.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.400]   - Right.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.040]   - So they're unhappy with them on the internet.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:55.880]   - Right.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.800]   - Let's see, Apple spent a little of that money
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   on a company called Shazam, a $400 million for Shazam.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:12.400]   Shazam, actually that was apparently a bargain-based price
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.760]   because they were valued even higher than that.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.840]   Shazam, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.680]   Shazam, at least the public-facing business of Shazam
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.480]   is figuring out what songs they're hearing right now.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.280]   - I don't know how they make that much money.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.520]   I mean, certain things I don't use as average user.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.760]   Anytime I've ever used Shazam,
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.960]   I don't even click through because once you play a song
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.880]   and it recognizes or even a show,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.680]   it'll bring up to iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, wherever.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.120]   And it's like, oh, do you wanna buy it?
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.400]   And you can click right through the app
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.480]   and it'll take it to you.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.720]   And since I pay for Apple Music and Spotify,
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.200]   I just back right back out
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.400]   and then go put it in my playlist.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.720]   And I never, since Shazam never even gets a click
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.760]   or anything from me.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.120]   So I guess they get the view from the app.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.040]   But I'm like, how do they make this much money?
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.720]   Especially now when you could just say,
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.960]   you could talk to Siri
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.600]   and Siri will just tell you what song is playing.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.680]   You don't even have to like fully go into Shazam.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.360]   I mean, I guess they're partnered, or whatever.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.000]   I just don't know how they make so much money.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.320]   I don't- - I don't-
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.920]   - Maybe Apple would make more
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.800]   'cause they have Apple Music.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.480]   But after we looked at this on MacPrick Weekly this week,
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.680]   I think we came to the conclusion
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.280]   that it wasn't really for Shazam the product,
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.320]   but that the Shazam team was pretty sophisticated
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.160]   and that it probably was for the engineering talent.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.840]   That just tells you how much engineering talent
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.640]   is worth $400 million.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.000]   - Yeah, hopefully they'll do what Google did
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.360]   with the new Pixel phones,
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.040]   which they have a Shazam type feature.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.160]   - I know, isn't that funny then?
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.200]   - So you just pull out your phone?
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.520]   - To me that devalues Shazam
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.960]   because my phone is always listening
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.120]   and will tell me what I was listening to.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:40.960]   - You don't even need to ask.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.000]   Can if Apple does that at some point?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.280]   - Put that on the iPhone.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.760]   But the problem is that the Google phones
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.000]   have an always on screen, the iPhone screen dims.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.760]   - Yeah, Apple needs to start doing stuff
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.680]   with an always on screen,
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.680]   which I assume they will do at some point.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.080]   - Well, that would be interesting, wouldn't it?
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.240]   - Yeah, they'll have three years behind, so they'll get it.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.680]   - They'll invent it in about 2019, you think?
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.680]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.520]   - The always on screen.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.840]   - It's thinner and lighter than ever before.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.120]   - Actually, I'm gonna defend the iPhone X.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.040]   I really think it's a beautiful phone.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.560]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.240]   But I have to say, I've noticed something,
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.440]   ever since I got Android 8.1 on the Google Pixel 2,
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.680]   Android 8.1, this was, I don't know,
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.840]   maybe Dan, with your long history in technology,
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.160]   you can remember, I can't remember a company ever doing this.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.760]   Google never announced it, but they built in a chip.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.600]   There's a DSP, dedicated DSP for photography
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.320]   in the Pixel 2 that wasn't turned on when it shipped.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.040]   They never told anybody about it,
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.920]   and it just got turned on with the release of Android 8.1.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.640]   And the pictures got noticeably better.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.040]   It was a really interesting,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.520]   I can't think of a company ever doing that before.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.600]   - Maybe we haven't been told before.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   - Yeah.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   - But cameras these days are essentially the software.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.120]   That's what distinguishes them.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:12.120]   The chip that's, the processing stuff is important
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.440]   and you get more power doing it, but increasingly software.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.680]   That's why Apple's phones have had better cameras
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.360]   for a long time, they were better at it.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.720]   But Google really caught up.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.200]   One thing I'd like to see Apple do with some of that money,
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.000]   it makes every second is pay its fair share of taxes,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.680]   but that's also a strange request in our current world.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.240]   - Actually, it's not because--
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.680]   - They're not the only one dodging.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.480]   - Everybody is, but didn't Facebook this week announce
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.680]   that they were gonna start paying their taxes locally?
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:50.680]   They're not gonna use the double Irish tax strategy
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.000]   that Apple, Google and many others had used?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.280]   I thought that was very interesting.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.480]   Remember that this strategy, this double Irish
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.720]   with the Dutch sandwich, I think that's what it's called,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.720]   is not illegal, although the EU has started to go to countries
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.080]   that do this in particularly Ireland and say,
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.760]   no, you got to charge taxes, you can't not charge taxes.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.560]   The reason Ireland was getting the cash inflow
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.000]   from all these companies is they had close
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.400]   to zero corporate taxes.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.720]   The EU has demanded that Ireland go back to Apple
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.040]   and ask for the money.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.200]   And maybe that's why Facebook is doing it.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.920]   - Well, it'd be a competitive advantage.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.840]   And Facebook has enough money to pay the taxes.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.160]   Apple does too.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.720]   At some point, this is all going to end up
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.440]   with massive bills from Europe if they don't.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.280]   - So you think it's that?
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.880]   I thought it might be that Mark Zuckerberg
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.720]   is running for president in a couple of years.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.400]   He doesn't want people to come at him saying,
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.280]   you don't even pay your taxes.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.400]   - Is that not what the president says he doesn't pay taxes?
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.720]   - I don't know what the president says he doesn't.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.120]   - That's not a real issue.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.440]   - That doesn't hurt, huh?
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.160]   - That doesn't seem to, yeah, it's not been an issue.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.240]   - Facebook--
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.440]   - You're not the way that it should.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.600]   - Anyway. - Facebook paid in taxes
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.960]   in 2014 in Ireland, $6,000.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   - It seems incredible to me. - In taxes in Ireland.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.800]   - Seems fair.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.120]   In the US, it's got a bill,
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.400]   it's battling with the IRS for $5 billion
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.200]   plus interest in penalties
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.560]   due to global operations reported by the Irish Unit.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.200]   So it is kind of in a little bit of trouble.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   And I guess it's legal until somebody says it's not.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.240]   - The European Commission has ordered Apple
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.400]   to pay 13 billion euros,
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.520]   that's about 15 billion dollars in back taxes.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.160]   Apple's agreed to put that money in escrow
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.480]   while it appeals.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:54.560]   The EU says Ireland gave it unfair deal.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.200]   Ireland's also appealing by the way.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.680]   - It's--
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.320]   - I don't know a question of part of my ignorance,
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.960]   but does Facebook do a rev share
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.480]   with the ads that they put on videos now?
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.680]   Facebook do a rev share.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.920]   You mean with publishers?
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.760]   - Yeah.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.960]   - Did they not do that?
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.880]   - Historically they didn't,
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.080]   but I thought they'd been a gun dabbling with it at least.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:17.920]   - Oh, dabbling,
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.280]   because that's more of a concern to me
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.080]   when you're out there running these ads
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.040]   and not paying or sharing the money
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.880]   that you're forcing ads upon.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.720]   I don't know.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.680]   There's a lot of things that we could worry about.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.520]   People not getting paid and skirting funds
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.240]   and paying people their fair share of things.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.560]   So, but it's the American way.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.840]   That's the way the laws are written.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.400]   And so, it's not cheating until you get caught.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.240]   So.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.040]   - They don't have it fully in place like YouTube does,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   that's for sure.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.920]   - Yeah, but they said, this year I think they said
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   they were to start doing it.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.680]   I don't know, I don't know what the current state is.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.280]   They're also telling publishers now
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.200]   to put mid-roll ads in, right?
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.640]   And pre-roll ads, they're really pushing publishers
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.520]   to do more advertising.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.520]   - Hey Leo, I have to make a disclosure
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.000]   if I'm gonna talk about Facebook at all.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.800]   And that is, they are one of the funders
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.160]   of the new collaborative lab that we started
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.080]   at Arizona State.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.800]   So, just that has to be disclosed.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   - I'm glad you did that.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.120]   And Jeff Jarvis does that every time we talk about Facebook
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.160]   on Twig as well, 'cause he's part of that Facebook initiative,
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.400]   the journalism initiative.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.560]   Is this related to that?
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.520]   - There are another of the funders.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.360]   - Okay.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.280]   - The news integrity.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.360]   - News integrity initiative, that's right, yeah.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.880]   But I trust both you and Jeff, I know that you're not gonna stint,
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.000]   you're not gonna hold back in criticizing Facebook.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.080]   - Well, yeah, we agree on little, but--
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:44.920]   (laughing)
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.760]   - That's what--
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   - When it comes to getting public better informed
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:56.920]   and trying to slow down this plague of misinformation,
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   we do agree on that.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.160]   - Yeah, something needs to be done, that's for sure.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.320]   - I think it's interesting, I wonder if Apple and Google
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.920]   and others who are using the,
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.040]   actually Apple stopped using the Irish,
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.240]   double Irish with a Dutch sandwich, I'm just like saying that.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.520]   And has now started bearing money in the island of Jersey.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.800]   And because the financial news,
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.480]   financial press hasn't yet dubbed that anything,
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.720]   I'm gonna call it the Jersey Fudge.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.560]   And so they've moved from, (laughing)
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.360]   and I only call it that for one reason.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.680]   We have a friend, a viewer who lives in Jersey
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.160]   is watching right now, calls himself Jersey Fudge
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.600]   and brings us Fudge from Jersey,
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.040]   apparently they have very lovely cows in Jersey.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.680]   And a lot of Apple money, all of a sudden,
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.400]   billions of dollars, pouring, and guess what?
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.160]   What do you guess Jersey's corporate tax rate is,
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.120]   the Isle of Jersey?
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.240]   Well, we just take a wild guess,
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   what's there, how much they charge companies?
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.080]   Zero, of course.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.840]   Why else would you put your money there, right?
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.960]   Apple doesn't, I don't imagine Apple makes a lot of money
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.880]   in Jersey.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.440]   Cows don't buy a lot of computers.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.840]   And I agree with you, so I agree with you, Dan.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.280]   But Apple is quick to point out, yeah, well,
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.000]   but it's legal, so we're gonna do it
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.760]   because it's our fiduciary responsibility
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.420]   to our shareholders to maximize profits.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:16.440]   There was a time when companies actually
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.640]   had some interest in the public good,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.320]   that seems to be long gone.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.320]   It's disappeared, yeah.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.160]   Well, I'll qualify that.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.320]   They wish to appear to have an interest in the public good.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.960]   No, I think there were actual,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.480]   there have been companies over our history
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.720]   that cared a lot about the communities
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.840]   that they were based in and did a lot of good things for them.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.000]   And there are, I think, still a lot of corporations
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.520]   that have a corporate conscience of some sort.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.360]   We just do live in a time when people are,
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.640]   every incentive is to please shareholders
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.720]   and top executives and law and otherwise,
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.280]   and hardly any incentive to do anything else.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.120]   - Yeah.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.280]   Also, we're more of a global economy.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.920]   Before, when you used to make jackets down the street
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.760]   and everybody worked at the jacket factory,
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.960]   it's like, oh, this is 100% made here.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.240]   Apple says, "designed in California,
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.400]   but they're not making these devices."
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.600]   So they've got to send stuff out there,
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.520]   all sorts of stuff, their ship is stuff back in.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.160]   And basically America is now just a service center.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.840]   We don't make anything anymore.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.600]   We just sell stuff to each other over and over and over again
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.920]   and feed each other pieces.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.920]   So the stock in caring about your community and your people,
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.720]   it's different because the mega-corpse are global brands
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.640]   that literally just outsource all the work.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.760]   So it's like, well, you don't even really work for us.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.000]   So you do a pass a phone over to somebody
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:47.840]   and swipe a credit card.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.720]   You didn't slave away at a factory building this stuff.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.000]   So it's a different mindset and it's different mentality.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.760]   And that's why people here don't get as angry about it
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.800]   as they should because if they did,
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.120]   then that tax situation and other things
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.400]   and jobs would change blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.440]   - Blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.040]   Blah, blah, blah is kind of sums it all up, doesn't it?
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.880]   - Pretty much.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.140]   (laughing)
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.880]   - Let's see, Apple launches its podcast.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.160]   As long as I'm in the Apple section,
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.520]   I can stick with Apple for a little bit.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.840]   It's podcast analytics service and debate.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.680]   We will not be using this.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.080]   I'm not sure why Apple is doing this.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.080]   I think a lot, the problem I have with this
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.040]   is only about half of our listeners,
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.120]   half of you listen on iTunes.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.560]   So this won't be valuable analytics material for us,
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.080]   although I don't know, maybe.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.520]   - I'd like to say analytics
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.920]   when the people watching their creative content.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.760]   - Yeah.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.600]   (laughing)
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.280]   - Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.600]   You mean like Planet of the Apps?
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.440]   - Yeah.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.760]   - There is a show, huh?
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.400]   - Oh man, I forget they just bought something recently.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.920]   Oh, I've just read it.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.840]   They looked interesting from Battlestar,
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.320]   Glactica, they bought something from their,
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.000]   man, I'm sorry, I'm butchering it 'cause I can't remember
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   what it is, but they bought something
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:10.880]   that looked interesting.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.640]   Let's see if they actually put something interesting
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.360]   on their service for Apple music.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.240]   - Subscribe.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.880]   - They ordered a space drama from Ronald D. Moore.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.280]   - There we go.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.600]   - Is he the Battlestar, Galactica guy, is it?
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.400]   Who is he?
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.240]   - Yeah.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:33.120]   - I'm afraid I'm just not up on my--
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.680]   - Me either, again, just hoping to talk about it.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.160]   - Yeah, he's the mastermind.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.040]   Ooh, he's the mastermind behind Battlestar, Galactica.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.120]   He helped Shape TV as we know it.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.360]   - Wow.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.800]   - And hopefully he can do something for them
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.160]   that makes my 9.99 or 15.99 a month worth it.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.760]   'Cause everything I've tried to watch on there
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.480]   is just garbage.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   - Apple's ordered an entire series to be created
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.960]   and written by Moore along with two executive producers
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.240]   of Fargo, which was also excellent.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.080]   - That's interesting.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.800]   - Yeah, and Gadget reports the series
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.920]   will explore what would have happened
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.520]   if the space race between the US, Soviet Russia,
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.560]   and the West of the world hadn't ended.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.640]   - That sounds like fun.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.480]   - Yeah.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.320]   - Yeah.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.160]   - I've got something I'm interested in.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.000]   - See, Apple is gonna spend a billion dollars
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.480]   on original content, which sounds like a lot
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.440]   until you find out that Netflix spent $8 billion this year
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.600]   and is on track to spend even more next year
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.440]   in the year after.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.960]   This has become, isn't it interesting,
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.880]   the year of original content?
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.120]   All of these services realize that they can't rely
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:37.080]   on Hollywood and movies to propel their services,
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.280]   their subscription services.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.200]   So they're all making their own stuff.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.240]   They also realize they can't afford it.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.880]   - It's expensive. - It's expensive.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.720]   - Yeah.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.680]   - If you make your own, not only do you pay the money in-house,
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.200]   you keep it for yourself or you're exclusive
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.080]   to bring people to you, but then if you ever wanna sell it
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.920]   to a network station later on down the line,
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.480]   you're like, "Hey, you want this old punisher run?
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.520]   "Here you go.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.560]   "It's all finished.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.840]   "We had it on Netflix for 10 years.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.080]   "Nobody's watching anymore.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.240]   "You wanna put it on TNT?"
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.200]   - That is a long tail, baby, long tail.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.040]   - Here you go.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.880]   - Hey.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.560]   - Enjoy it while it laughs.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.400]   - Really?
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.080]   You think this is just a blip?
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.760]   This is a bubble?
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.920]   - Well, there's some bubble piece to it, mainly because
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.920]   I think probably I have a list of seven or eight things
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.320]   that look pretty good that I would like to watch.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.840]   If I get to three of them, it'll be amazing.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.680]   - I think that's the-
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.520]   - I think that is a problem for us as viewers.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.020]   It's overwhelming.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.560]   - I think it's a problem for people that live
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.480]   where you live and do the job that you do,
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.680]   because again, out here in regularville-
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.520]   - Yeah?
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.920]   - What's it like in regularville?
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.440]   Do you have a TV?
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.720]   Do you guys have indoor plumbing yet?
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.560]   Let me tell you something.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   Me and three of my friends this week alone,
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.360]   we watched all the Jean-Claude Van Damme on Amazon
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.720]   in a day, six episodes talked about it.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.640]   I watched all the crack will start up season two
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.200]   in about a day and a half,
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.040]   watched the punisher and two day like-
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.640]   - Yeah, but you had kidney stones.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.800]   You had an excuse.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:10.280]   - I work from home and I got a screen on with work
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.880]   and I'm watching the punisher on the other side.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.480]   Me and professionals in your journals,
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.680]   you got a research to do, yeah, an important job.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.280]   For regular people, that's why binge watching is-
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.120]   - That's what's-
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.120]   - TV on your average, how much TV a day or a week be sick?
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:28.680]   - I personally watch, I just wanna say horrible,
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.320]   I watch like four or five hours TV a day on average.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.160]   - I do too.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.720]   - I get home, I'm exhausted.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.560]   I turn on the TV, I'll binge the crown
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.800]   or we'll binge dark or we'll binge,
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.960]   you know, there's a lot of bingeing involved.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.280]   - I'm just saying, people be watching stuff, I don't know.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.120]   I might be my-
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.760]   - Last night, I wish you'd been over.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.080]   I was watching the crown,
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.320]   Lisa and I were watching the crown,
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.920]   it was getting a little slow.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.200]   I said, I'm gonna make oatmeal cookies.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.680]   And we had oatmeal cookies and we watched the crown.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.500]   - At the same time?
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.100]   - At the same time.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.880]   - See, it's winter time here too.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.800]   - Winter time here too,
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.720]   so me and my daughter are watching Family Matters
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.800]   and Doogie Houser.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.000]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.480]   - Four hours of Doogie Houser, 13 episodes.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   - Here's, I'll tell you who believes in streaming.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.480]   - Doogie, watch Doogie Houser.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.920]   - I'll tell you who believes in the future of streaming.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.360]   Disney.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.840]   Disney just did a deal with Rupert Murdoch
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.840]   to buy the video assets, 20th Century Fox, Sky TV,
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:29.080]   the Hollywood film studio from Rupert Murdoch
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.760]   for $66 billion.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.320]   There's a very scary picture of Rupert Murdoch
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:38.920]   with Bob Iger and the dome of St. Paul's in the distance.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.760]   That is, if you don't spend that kind of money,
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.560]   unless you think that you need a content,
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.420]   you need a content, why would Disney buy this?
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:52.520]   Is it, as some said a belief in streaming,
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.160]   one of the assets they get,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.400]   which I think is very interesting,
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.800]   is all the local sports nets,
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.720]   the Fox sports nets all over the country.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.240]   They don't get Fox news, they don't get politics.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.240]   - Don't get F-1, don't get F-2.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.840]   - Don't they, I thought they did.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.240]   - I don't think that's part of the deal.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.080]   Am I mistaken?
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.520]   - I think they're not getting the Fox network
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.600]   and they're not getting Fox news,
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.880]   but I thought they were getting almost everything else.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.400]   - Oh, you're right, assets that are not part of the sale
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.480]   will be spun off as a separate business called New Fox.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.880]   New Fox, that'll be Fox TV, Fox News, Fox Business,
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.640]   Fox Sports and the regional stations.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.680]   So you're right. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.000]   - So that's a separate asset, a very valuable asset, right?
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.200]   - The sports stuff. - Yes, sports sports.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.320]   - I mean, Disney, it believes in the future of streaming,
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.560]   but they believe in this future
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.080]   that's quite different from what we have now
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.840]   because they believe in running their own streaming services
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.680]   and not-- - That's what they're doing.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.640]   - Not doing that, Fox. - They took all the stuff
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.680]   off Netflix and said, no, no,
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.000]   we're gonna put all the Disney stuff
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.840]   and they're gonna make their assets so valuable
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.440]   that people will pay for Disney TV.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.520]   - And after the steal is done, they will control Hulu
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.400]   'cause they'll own 60% of us. - Again, Hulu too.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.320]   - That's right. - And that sounds like
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.920]   they're re-imagining Hulu as a place
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.040]   for the stuff they own that would not be appropriate
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.560]   on a Disney-centric service, which includes a lot
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.840]   of the Fox stuff that-- - FX, do they get FX?
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.360]   - Yes. - Okay, so that's a great source of--
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.320]   - The adult-ish Fox stuff. - Right.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.760]   - They imagine Hulu as being the home for that.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.600]   - I wasn't even thinking about streaming so much
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.840]   is that they, with this purchase and acquisition,
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.680]   they pretty much own the box office.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.920]   There's so many movies that are made
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.560]   that are flop franchises like Warner Brothers
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.120]   can't get DC out of its own way since the Dark Knight
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.600]   and Batman, they can't make the money they want.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.400]   They get Star Wars and that's a billion dollar project
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.520]   like that, Marvel, Infinity Stuff, billion dollars,
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.360]   just like that.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.720]   Now like, oh yeah, you guys screwed up X-Men,
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.720]   another billion dollars, we could fix that.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.200]   Like they're-- - They have so much--
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.800]   - They become, as the Atlantic magazine said,
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.640]   the Death Star of TV.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.280]   They are now the biggest planet in the solar system.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.200]   By the way, the acquisition also reunited
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   the Star Wars franchise 'cause Fox owned episode four,
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.520]   the first Star Wars movie, and they owned some Marvel assets
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.280]   that-- - They did a deal with Marvel
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.880]   before Marvel was mattered all that much in movies,
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.560]   which is why they had a bunch of this.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.720]   - So how long before we see Hulk
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:20.200]   in the Millennium Falcon with Chewy together at last?
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.240]   - On the planet of the apes.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.600]   - On the planet, why not just put it all together?
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.840]   - I think they, I figure Disney will.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.640]   Clearly we're gonna see a new Star Wars movie
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.040]   every single year forever.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:34.640]   - The theme parks will have all these new franchises in 'em.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.760]   - I have a lot of faith in Disney's ability
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.800]   to destroy the Star Wars franchise.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.320]   - Have you seen The Last Jedi yet?
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.160]   Now no spoilers, I promise anybody watching,
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.800]   we're not gonna tell you anything.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:49.480]   - I haven't, I'm gonna wait 'til I don't have to be
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.280]   in a theater with lots of people--
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.160]   - Wait for cable-- - Talking on their phones, yeah.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.760]   No, I won't wait for cable, but it's--
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.120]   (laughing)
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:56.960]   - They're not, they're not--
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:57.800]   - They're not in theater on their phones,
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.080]   they're nerds, they're fans,
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.680]   they're all looking at the screen and,
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.920]   oh, oh, oh.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.800]   - That's true, there was nobody on the phone.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.720]   Although when we saw it, we saw it Thursday at 6 p.m.,
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.040]   we saw the first public showing in Petaluma,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.320]   and the projector died about 10 minutes into it.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.480]   - What?
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:15.240]   - Ooh, that was a bad moment.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.480]   If I'd been the theater manager,
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.320]   I would have been very afraid.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.160]   - Right?
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.600]   - It was kind of funny 'cause we were sitting in the back row
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.320]   so I could look in through the window,
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.640]   and so I'm looking at the projector,
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.640]   and it's a computer, right?
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.160]   They get the movie on a hard drive,
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.720]   they plug the hard drive into the Christie projector,
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.160]   it's a DLP projector,
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.840]   and it's basically a giant,
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.000]   like a two refrigerator-sized computer
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.840]   with a projector and a big stovepipe
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.400]   coming off it to get the heat off.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.920]   And so she's wearing this nice little blazer,
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.000]   she goes and she's opening the door,
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:45.880]   and she's like, "You could tell."
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.880]   She's like, "I don't know."
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.280]   And then I really started to worry
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.000]   'cause she then she got on the phone.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.040]   So I figured she's talking to the tech support guy
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.080]   in Dallas.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   - I just went off, I don't know.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.040]   - So I thought we're going home,
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.640]   we're not gonna see the rest of this movie,
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.080]   but they rebooted it, and they got,
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.400]   and they started the movie over,
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.880]   so we got to see the first 10 minutes twice.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.640]   But what was interesting is,
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.280]   this is a weird crowd,
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.320]   this is a crowd of paid extras,
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.600]   see the first public showing.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.000]   While the theater's dark,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.920]   some guy had on his, he had an Android phone
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.440]   with a Peacup projector,
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.800]   and he had episodes, the last Star Wars,
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.560]   on it, and he was projecting the Force Awakens
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.760]   on the screen, like this big.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   (laughing)
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.200]   And people are cheering and they're watching it.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.400]   You know, you put it up there and there's the crawl.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.880]   - Right, episode seven.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.720]   - And it was...
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.560]   - Super nerds.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.400]   - That's nerds, so they weren't on the phone,
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.280]   they were really, then it started up,
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:49.240]   we watched the whole first 10 minutes again,
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.480]   and then it died again about halfway through.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.040]   Oh my God.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:56.280]   - So, Celia, I got a question about the,
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.360]   Disney's clearly gonna start its own streaming service.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.200]   - Yep.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.120]   - CBS decided that the, apparently,
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:08.680]   the best way to get people to sign up for theirs
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.680]   was to do this new Star Trek series available only on streaming.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:17.120]   - Is this the Tarantino one?
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.440]   No.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.280]   - No, it's Star Trek Discovery.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.120]   - It's a new Star Trek story.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   - And I just wonder, so at what point
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:29.200]   are people gonna say...
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.040]   - It's too fragmented.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.960]   - Yeah, right, I'm gonna subscribe
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:35.920]   to 400 different things at $20 a month each or $10.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.760]   - You're gonna replace your $200 cable bill,
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.120]   which is also already crazy,
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   with a $60 internet bill, plus 20,
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.680]   you're right, $25, $15, $12 subscriptions, whatever.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.440]   I just gotta notice Netflix is going up to 13.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.040]   - Actually, what am I saying?
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.840]   The Comcast will save us, they'll just...
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.760]   - Oh yeah, there you go.
[00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.920]   - Take it all the way.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.640]   - Do you want the entertainment bundle?
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.400]   It'll be cable, we're gonna have cable like you.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.880]   - They're reinventing cable television.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.200]   - Yes, but it's in the first principles.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.600]   - Interactive cable, there's gonna be a button.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.760]   - Whatever happened to that.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:17.760]   - Buy this.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:18.560]   - Do you remember that?
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.200]   Interactive cable, that was gonna be all the rage.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.040]   Two-way cable.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.920]   - Several times, like in the seven days,
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.440]   and then the early 90s.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.320]   - I remember they did, I think it was Comcast
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.080]   at a trial in Florida, where so you had a remote
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.920]   and the cable was two-way, so you could interact.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.720]   And what they found is only thing people did
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.400]   is they bought postage stamps.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.480]   That was like the only surface
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.840]   they really were interested in.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.360]   Was it complete flop?
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.200]   We don't have, there is no interactive cable,
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.000]   is there in the country?
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.240]   We have the internet, we don't need it.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.520]   - Yeah, and the old days people thought
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.720]   that we would be doing all this through TV.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.560]   - With a remote.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.480]   - And we do it all, but we don't do it through TV.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.320]   - Right.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.400]   - Well, side note before we pay some bills on Kaleo,
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.520]   'cause we gotta pay some bills.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.120]   - You see the blue sheet come out, don't you?
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:02.960]   You know it.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.440]   - I just also wanna say, this is not a very positive,
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.800]   popular thing to say in this type of show,
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.840]   but that's why the real movement of the world,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.000]   the only reason people buy fire sticks right now
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.320]   is because that's what you said.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.360]   They're not paying all these subscription fees
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.280]   and all these things.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.160]   That's why we're gonna talk about it later,
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.800]   but that's why they buy Amazon Firestick.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.240]   The only reason anyone ever will buy an Amazon Firestick
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.200]   is because the power that it gives you
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.720]   of hacking it and getting everything you want for free.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.440]   So, America, America.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.200]   So, if paid these bills, we'll talk about Amazon.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.440]   - There's the answer to Dan's.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440]   - There's the stuff down the road.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.000]   - There's the answer to Dan's conundrum.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.360]   Just become a pirate, Dan.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.880]   - Everything is available.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.160]   - Average people are doing it.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.080]   I know people that aren't computer savvy
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.880]   and they're at the softball game talking about,
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.280]   hey, you want a Firestick man,
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.240]   just order one off Amazon 40 bucks.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.080]   I put it on there for $5.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.800]   So, I mean, I'm like, wait, you not use a computer?
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.200]   Like, you can read?
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.040]   Oh, wow.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:01.880]   (laughs)
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.280]   So, I mean, there's, there's,
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.760]   people are, average people are finding a way
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.400]   because they're tired of being nickel and dime
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.680]   by all these services.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.000]   - Well, do you know where there's a winner?
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.840]   - Look at this, installing Cody
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.440]   on an Amazon Firestick.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.280]   What, here's a--
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.640]   - Oh, Cody, of course, right.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.480]   - Yeah.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.360]   - People are also asking, says Google,
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.880]   what free channels do you get with a Firestick?
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.200]   How do you download Cody to a Firestick?
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.240]   How can you hack Fire TV?
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.480]   Here's a five-step hack on YouTube for--
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.640]   (laughs)
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.640]   - It's Amazon is gonna fix that.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:34.960]   - Amazon's gonna fix that.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.200]   Amazon's gonna fix that fast.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.280]   They're gonna block it.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.920]   I'll bet you they block it.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.800]   - It's been going on for four years.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.880]   When are they gonna block it?
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.120]   Like, at what point did they say,
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.400]   hey, we gotta stop this?
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.760]   Oh, maybe we don't block it
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.520]   'cause we keep selling Firesticks.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.880]   And that's the only reason people are buying a Firestick
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.840]   over a Chromecast or Apple TV
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.920]   or anything else is a better device.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.520]   Oh, because they can hack this.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.280]   That's the reason they haven't done it.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.800]   It's been a long, Cody's been going on for a while now
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.240]   and it is a wide gangbusters.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   - I have no idea this was going on.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.880]   I've missed everything.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.760]   I don't know if it's gotten critical mass
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.200]   and certainly Amazon has its own content
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.760]   and has to deal with Hollywood,
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.240]   which if this thing got big enough,
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.560]   and I know Cody's been out there,
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.320]   but if this got to be really big,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.680]   I got a feeling Hollywood would just force them
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.520]   to shut it down.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.640]   - Have we done a know-how yet
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.360]   on how to hack your Firestick?
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.280]   - Well, again, I know it's the reason
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.680]   Amazon doesn't care 'cause you get Amazon Prime.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.920]   So when you ordered your Firestick,
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.440]   you probably got the Prime for free.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.000]   So you're already paying for Amazon videos
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.120]   so they don't care again.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:37.960]   - You know. - 'Cause you're watching
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.800]   your content.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.720]   - I think the FCC should step in.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.960]   - They should. - Somebody should do something.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.800]   I'm just telling you,
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.080]   like I said, when I was at a softball game
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.760]   and a dude that I went to high school with,
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.720]   this dude, God bless him,
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.400]   he picks up recycling for a living.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.760]   He's not a bright guy
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.920]   and he's out there slanging Firesticks
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.000]   at the softball game.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.840]   And I'm like,
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.040]   - Are you selling the packed Firesticks
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.320]   at the kids softball game?
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.120]   - All day he's flipping them.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.400]   The dude's making $120 a week flipping Firestick.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.920]   - This is impressive. - And again,
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.360]   he's not a bright guy.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.040]   - You know what?
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.520]   You want to know how impressive they are?
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.240]   Go on to let go app, type in Firestick.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.640]   Go on to the Facebook marketplace
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.840]   and type in Firestick.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.000]   And you will see people with stacks of 15, 100 of them
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.480]   saying preloaded,
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.680]   holding unlocked, blah, blah, blah,
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.280]   $60, $80.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.280]   This is an epidemic.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.120]   I mean, again, you've been journaling live
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:30.960]   and doing a real job.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.400]   I'm living over here and people stealing stuff land.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.960]   And it is like Donkey Kong.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.680]   - I'm going to take your word for it
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.320]   'cause this is bigger than I thought it was.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.160]   - Well, I guess--
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.520]   - Remember though, when people were hacking
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.840]   like the DirectTV and they would put different cards in,
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.680]   remember that?
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.040]   And then DirectTV, it was like a cat and mouse game.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:52.680]   DirectTV would send a pulse down that would break it.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.920]   And then you'd buy a new hacked card
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.040]   and then you'd put it in.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.640]   And eventually the smartest thing DirectTV did is
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.960]   they did some sort of,
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:04.960]   they sent out the patch bit by bit
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.920]   and they all of a sudden they bricked,
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.720]   they bricked everybody all at once.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.240]   One evil Christmas Eve, I'm making it up.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.120]   Maybe wasn't Christmas Eve?
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.320]   It feels like it should have been.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.480]   They just broke everybody's DirectTV,
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.360]   hacked DirectTV.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.000]   - But don't look on any open market
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.480]   and see how many are stacked up for sale.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.400]   - No, I'm looking. - It's incredible.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.760]   - What should I pay for this though?
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.880]   I mean, they range in price from--
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.360]   - $60 is the good price.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.800]   $80, somebody is ripping you off.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.560]   - Here's a $37 one.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.960]   - Remember the old school Apple TV,
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.280]   the big one with the hard drive?
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.120]   - Yeah.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.280]   - If those two were popular,
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.120]   people would boxy.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:37.960]   - You can have those, yeah.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.800]   - You can have the boxy on that,
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.480]   which sort of sounds like a very early version
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.320]   of what this is.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.160]   - It is, exactly.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.880]   I remember actually hacking the Apple TV.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.200]   Yeah, and then eventually--
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.760]   - But now it's so easy, anybody could do it.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.200]   You can learn again in three minutes.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.080]   - Even this guy who is not a bright guy, I hear.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.040]   (laughing)
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:53.880]   He's not a bright guy.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.000]   I'm not gonna say his name 'cause that's insulting,
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.320]   but I mean, when I say not a bright guy out,
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.400]   that's me being kind.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.560]   And again, he's just selling it, explaining it.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.400]   - What's--
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.360]   - What if he's listening?
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.800]   He's not that bright, he's not listening.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.480]   I have no fear in my life of him listening to any episode of--
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.560]   - Let me ask you, 'cause this is a measure
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.400]   that we used to use.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.920]   What's the tooth to mouth ratio?
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.880]   Does he have all his teeth?
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.880]   - Oh, he works for the state.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.720]   He's got all his teeth.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.560]   He's got good insurance.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.400]   - Oh, he's got good teeth.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.800]   - Yeah, he picks up blue bins and recycling
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.640]   and puts him in a truck.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.640]   That's the--
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.760]   - Oh, he works for the state.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.680]   Oh, he's got a great, he's a union job.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.520]   - Stop playing.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.960]   - This is a little side business.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.600]   - I'm dropping him off in a recycling business
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.360]   to people doing it on a better house.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.840]   Hey, I can get your free TV.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.760]   You want CBS discovery?
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.920]   I got you.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.040]   - This actually was prosecuted in England, not here,
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.720]   but in England, the judge said he let him off.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.040]   He avoided prison, the Cody Box seller,
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.680]   but the judge said others may not be so lucky.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.520]   So, you know, I'm just saying.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.600]   - Remember the old days where you would get
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.440]   like a pirate cable box and--
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.280]   - Yeah.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.120]   - Yeah.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.800]   - A cable company you had in 1983.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.160]   - Let's, this is, I'm learning so much on this show.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.680]   I can't wait to go home and have,
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.160]   I have a fire stick, just I never opened it.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.600]   Now I know what to do with it.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   ♪ A whole new world ♪
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.320]   (laughing)
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.080]   ♪ House of channels just for you ♪
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.040]   - Can Amazon, I mean, they could push out an update
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.200]   that would change the fix.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.600]   - Again, why would they?
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.920]   It's the only reason people buy this device.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.360]   Go ahead and read the blue sheet, we got stuff to do.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:40.040]   - However, I did buy an Amazon, a Kindle Fire,
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.560]   because I wanted to put a different operating system on it
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.080]   and they broke that in a hurry.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.480]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.480]   - I'm just wondering if Amazon sells hacked fire sticks.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   - 'Cause, nope.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.800]   'Cause that would be a really interesting kind of,
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.040]   let me see if they just search for a hacked fire stick
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.120]   on Amazon.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.440]   Wouldn't that be funny if they--
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.320]   - That's for like Amazon Cody Fire Stick.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.720]   - Oh yeah, Cody, 'cause that's the key word.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.720]   Cody, 'cause he doesn't come with Cody,
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.200]   and Cody, by the way, is completely legitimate.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.800]   Yeah, but they do sell a Kindle edition book,
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.000]   learn how to install Cody on Fire Stick.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.560]   (laughing)
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.880]   - If you're not too bright.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.160]   - There's actually so many books.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.840]   Cody on Fire Stick.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.960]   Look at all these.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.720]   There's a ton of books.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.000]   - And you don't eat, the best part is,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.880]   you don't even have to buy a book, it's on YouTube for free.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.400]   You can watch how to do it.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.080]   - Yeah, 'cause this guy's not pretty quite good in readable.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.280]   He's like, I see image, I copy image,
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.080]   I type in the code, it works.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.240]   - That's amazing.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.080]   - Here's the best seller.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:37.920]   - Kindle Unlimited.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.640]   - Kindle Unlimited, I already get that,
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.080]   so it's free for Kindle Unlimited.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.400]   Thank you, Amazon.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.600]   Making it easy.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.000]   You know, oh, and I'm starting to believe
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.840]   your conspiracy theory in Amazon.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.640]   - Look, and so like I said,
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.640]   you guys live in a world of smart people
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.560]   and the bubble and life.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.800]   I'm out here with Joe Schmo.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.240]   I know how stuff gets down.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.480]   Can we get to this ring?
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.040]   It's very important to me, Leo.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.640]   (laughing)
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.120]   I'm wearing it right now.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.040]   This is it, this is the Motive Ring.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.440]   I love this thing.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.960]   So you've all worn fitness bands and so forth.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.680]   Well, as technology has advanced,
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.360]   it's possible now to put all of the functionality
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.280]   of a fitness band into a ring, the Motive Ring.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.520]   In fact, this is kind of better
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.400]   than the average fitness band.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.160]   It's got a heart rate.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.800]   It connects with your phone wirelessly over Bluetooth.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.600]   You're gonna love the fact that the charge
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.360]   lasts three days and it's got two days of onboard memory
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.360]   so you don't have to have your phone sync.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360]   It'll sync automatically with the Motive Ring.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.320]   And actually I should launch the Motive software
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.400]   'cause you can find out so much
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.080]   about what you're doing, about what's going on.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.880]   This is so awesome.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.000]   M-O-T-I-V.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.960]   And I love the sleep tracker functionality
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.600]   because frankly, I don't wanna wear a watch to bed, right?
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.680]   That's uncomfortable.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.720]   A ring, not such a big deal.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.800]   So you can see how you slept.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.760]   You could see when you've been active.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.120]   You could see if you've been good or not.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.040]   No, no, that's Santa Claus, that's something else.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.080]   This is a, oh, no active minutes, no active minute.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.160]   Oh, there, whoo, active minutes, 94 active minutes.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.360]   I walked seven miles that day.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.400]   Look at that, 40.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.080]   And then I slept, but I only slept for five hours, 22 minutes.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.640]   You could see your sleep.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.040]   You could see your sleep trend, my seven day sleep trend.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.200]   All of this, 81% restful sleep,
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.000]   and one hour restless boy dog, I know about that.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.240]   Restless sleep.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.320]   This is awesome.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.560]   Unlike a bulky wristband, it's just 0.1 inches thick.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.640]   It weighs almost nothing.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.480]   It's very light.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.920]   You can get it, see the two colors.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.720]   I have the black one, a slate gray they call it.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.760]   And there's a rose gold one.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.760]   Waterproof, I wear it in the shower, no big deal.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.000]   It's made of ultralight titanium.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   It's actually waterproof up to five atmospheres.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:49.840]   That's, what is that?
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.040]   That's like pretty deep.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.080]   That's like 100 feet deep.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.360]   That's very deep.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.520]   So you can wear it all the time.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.360]   It's very comfortable.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.400]   They actually, when you order it,
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.560]   they'll send you a ring sizing kit.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.240]   So you can try on a range of sizes
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.480]   and pick the sizes right for you.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.600]   I got it just right.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.440]   According to the American Heart Association,
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.000]   I hate bad news for you.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.200]   We adults, we need about 150 minutes a week
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.640]   of moderate intensity aerobic activity
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.800]   to maintain good health.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.600]   The mode of ring makes it really easy.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.640]   This would be great for your new year resolution
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.800]   to get in shape to take care of yourself.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.040]   And it gives you, it charges.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.120]   See how that, it's so cool.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.440]   I go back a little bit in the charge.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.360]   So it's got a little USB dongle.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.520]   You get two of them.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:31.720]   You put it in, I have one plugged into a USB plug,
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.680]   but you can also plug it into your computer.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.840]   And then you just charge it up.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:35.760]   It's got a little magnet thing.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.360]   Charge is really fast.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.560]   So basically, I charge it every morning when I get up,
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.920]   after I measure my sleep, I get up.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.400]   When I get in the shower, I put it on the charger.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.400]   It's fully charged by the time my shower is done.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.280]   And now I got another two days or three days to go.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:54.080]   But if I just kind of top it off every day, that works great.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.200]   We've got $20 off your first order.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.360]   I've been wearing this now for a month.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.040]   I love this thing.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.920]   It's the activity tracker that's always on and always on you.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.920]   Visit mymotiv.com, M-Y-M-O-T-I-V.com.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.040]   And then to tweet, check out to get $20 off.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.880]   Mymotiv.com, promo code TWIT.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.920]   And I think it looks kind of jazzy, kind of nice.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.400]   Megan has the rose gold.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   That's also very pretty.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.840]   Very nice holiday gift.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.680]   Yes.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.040]   If you don't buy me one for Christmas, I think I might buy one.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.280]   The best thing you said with that was the sleep tracking,
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   because you're right.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.840]   I've had FitBitch, M-A-B-Waj, and I always take them off
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.720]   because they just--
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.720]   I don't want to wear those to get my sleep.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.400]   But a ring, I would think that might--
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.000]   that would be great because if you get the right size,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.480]   it feels good.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.480]   You won't even notice--
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.320]   You don't notice.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.400]   --people sleep with rings on all the time.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.360]   You don't notice it.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:44.880]   It's really cool.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.640]   That's great.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.400]   Thank you for that votive support.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.520]   We could probably get one sent out to you, Owen.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.400]   I'll talk to the people.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.360]   You want rose gold?
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.520]   Oh, I got to get your size and all that.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.040]   Lee Silly, mail you.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:55.440]   All right.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.440]   All right.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.440]   I'll send you a Cody fire stick to it.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.000]   Oh, no, actually, you got the--
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:01.640]   I'll send you a--
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.120]   And I am not a bright guy.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.760]   I'm just saying.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.080]   Look, I wish you would know this guy.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.920]   I'm about to just video tape a conversation with him
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.960]   and send it to you, personally.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:12.480]   Would you post it?
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.920]   So you can understand what I'm saying,
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.720]   because I'm trying to be kind by saying it to Charlie--
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.600]   Is he like crazy--
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.400]   --googling, I'm like, hey, yo, doctor.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.240]   How you doing?
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:25.720]   He is a beer drinking good old boy, just sports guy.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.040]   And he's the kind of parent that wants to kill other people's
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.600]   kids, like their kids, bro.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.360]   Calm down.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.040]   So he's just a very interesting guy.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.480]   Nice guy, sweet guy, slang and Cody.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.720]   It's the American way, side business.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.800]   Do you have you seen the first--
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.360]   Last Jedi, what are the--
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.480]   what are some of the movie--
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.400]   I did see it.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.320]   Saw an opening night without my child,
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.480]   because I'm a horrible parent.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.600]   Oh, you are a horrible parent.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.200]   You like it?
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.760]   I like-- it's a great movie.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.760]   It's a good Star Wars movie.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.160]   Yeah, I kind of say that, too.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.760]   They messed with some of my Star Wars stuff
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.240]   that as a purist, I find a huge problem with--
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.920]   And I'll tell you one thing that's not a spoiler,
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.760]   but it's just one statement.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.200]   The girl said, God's speed.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.000]   And I said, wait, aren't we supposed to say,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:12.960]   made a force with you?
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.880]   Who's talking about God?
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.360]   There's no God, it's the Force.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.080]   It's the dark side.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.280]   There were some lines in the script
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.520]   that I feel like Ryan Johnson maybe isn't the best writer ever.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.560]   And I was just like, what's good fun?
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.200]   The funniest line to me-- and this is not a spoiler.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.120]   I promise you, we're not spoiling anything.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.240]   But when you watch the movie, listen for this line.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.520]   To me, this like, landed--
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.160]   is I want to-- is it--
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.840]   I want to punch this beautiful city right in the mouth,
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.560]   or something like that.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.280]   I was like, what the hell?
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.400]   I want to punch a hole in this--
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.920]   I want to punch a hole in this beautiful city.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.520]   You remember it.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.200]   I was like, what the hell is that?
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:50.640]   But--
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.520]   But again, great action, great stuff you wanted to always see.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.040]   There's like one scene that--
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.440]   I'm not going to spoil it, I'm not going to say no about it.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.520]   There's one scene in this movie that you've always
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.640]   wanted to see any time you've ever watched "Star Wars,"
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.520]   and you get it, and it is amazing.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:08.960]   And did you like the diversity of the cast?
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.520]   Well, there's-- I mean, one of the heroes is Asian.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.240]   Finn's back, he's black.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.960]   I think the big heroes of--
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.400]   actually, mostly women is the big heroes in this, right?
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.680]   Women are the new wave, and that's great.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.320]   I mean, again, as far as diversity goes,
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.080]   when you're in outer space and you're
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.640]   going for multiple planets, one would
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.720]   hope there's diversity.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.280]   There's a lot of--
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.800]   There's a lot of different looking folks.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.560]   --like a different kind of fantasy.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.520]   There's people, black, people, brown people.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.080]   I love the Rabbi Bartender.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:39.640]   Wasn't that great?
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.640]   Remember that?
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.240]   Yep.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:41.720]   No.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.520]   I made that up.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.200]   You liar.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:43.800]   You didn't see it.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.040]   I disagree with you.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.040]   You was-- oh, trust me, I saw it.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.040]   Trust me, I saw it.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.080]   So what I've been playing with, and I really like--
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.600]   and we were talking about the Google phone when they updated
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.040]   Android 8.1, they secretly snuck in AR stickers
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.680]   into the application that really, really work well.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.800]   And there are a bunch of, as one would think, Star Wars
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.300]   tie-ins.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.600]   That's a BB-8.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.200]   And it really does-- I mean, look, it's a simple thing.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.320]   But you see in the shadow on BB-8,
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.720]   and it does look like it's actually
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.000]   on the surface of the desk.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.880]   There's a pork, which is kind of like a bird.
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:21.960]   Good eating, too, by the way.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.880]   Mighty good eating.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.280]   Look at that.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.080]   It's so cute.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.360]   And it's-- I think there's audio on this, too.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.200]   I don't know if I turn it down.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.880]   There's a walker.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.040]   And you can make these bigger.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.200]   You could actually make them giant.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.720]   And they shoot and stuff.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.880]   I think it's kind of fun.
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.320]   This is other stuff.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.040]   I made a floaty balloon with my daughter's name on it.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.880]   That's not really a balloon.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.080]   It's not really in the space, but it looks like it, right?
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:46.920]   That's pretty good.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.520]   Not bad.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.600]   It's funny, because Apple, of course, got all--
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.240]   there's a Stranger Things tie-in, too.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:57.120]   Apple got all the attention for AR and AR kid.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.760]   Now, interestingly, Google, I think, is responding to Apple.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.160]   Here's Lisa interacting with a stormtrooper.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.880]   She doesn't promise she can't see it,
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.280]   so she doesn't know she's kicking in the butt.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.960]   He's going to-- he's not going to-- he's not going to--
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.520]   he's not going to be happy about that.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.640]   But isn't it-- I mean, it's pretty amazing.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.760]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.560]   A lot of fun to play with.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.480]   Let me see if I have some more.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.640]   No, I don't.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.000]   That's the Google AR stickers that
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.720]   come with the new Google camera.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.080]   I think.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:31.920]   Do I have the--
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.840]   I'm waiting for my new Pixel to come.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.920]   I'm trying with all my heart to switch over from Apple.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.320]   This will do it for you.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.120]   I got-- well, I got my Pixel, and then something
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.560]   was wrong with the microphone.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.560]   Oh.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.680]   So I had to send it back, so I'm waiting for them
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.880]   to send me another one.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.520]   Like, I just got-- I switched out my MacBook Pro,
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.840]   and I am now on an HP Spectre.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:58.160]   And it's maxed out, and I think it's beautiful.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.000]   And I'm talking about-- Isn't that HP Spectre gorgeous?
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.640]   That's a really thin one, right?
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.200]   Yes.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:02.700]   Yes.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.840]   I love that laptop.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.840]   I have last years.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.520]   It's a ram.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.640]   Why get a Mac bank?
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:10.320]   All of the-- all of the speakers, it's-- the speakers
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.960]   are actually really nice on this thing, too,
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.760]   for a laptop that's this thin.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.760]   I'm thoroughly impressed with it and happy.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.880]   I built a tower in the middle of the summer.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.160]   I think I told you.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.000]   Well, you're all in this.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.640]   You're kind of dialed out of Apple, huh?
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.240]   I'm-- yep.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:28.240]   And on the left, to get rid of is my Mac Mini.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:31.200]   And then I'll be-- and I'll be good?
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:31.760]   Apple has a--
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.000]   I still got to keep an iPad down.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.680]   Apple isn't up to-- they have Mac Mini in like four years.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.120]   It's so small.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:36.680]   No.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:37.640]   That's a great computer.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.360]   I wish Apple would-- they don't really
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.880]   seem to be very interested in Macintosh anymore, I have to say,
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.320]   despite this Mac Pro.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.800]   So Google, I think, is having such success
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.120]   with this kind of poor man's AR, much like ARKit on Apple.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.160]   They created kind of a responsive ARKit.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:58.240]   ARCore, they had a much more sophisticated hardware-based
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.160]   augmented reality system called Tango.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.320]   Nobody adopted it.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.720]   There were only a couple of Tango phones.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.680]   And now Google's actually shutting it down.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.200]   Kind of.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.360]   I mean, they had been working in for years.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.080]   And just-- we did a story just, I think, a couple of months
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.200]   ago based on some demos we got of the hardware that
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.600]   supported Tango.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.880]   So it seems a little bit sudden that they've essentially
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.200]   shifted to doing something far more comparable
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.400]   to what Apple has been doing, which does not involve a lot
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.240]   of dedicated, specialized hardware.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.040]   It's just software.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.880]   And it is about as good as Apple's ARKit stuff.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.240]   Stuff doesn't quite hit the--
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.520]   solidly hit the table.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.360]   There is shadow.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.400]   But I think the point is it's good enough.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.480]   And I think Google realized is nobody
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.800]   wants to buy a bigger, heavier, more expensive phone
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.880]   with Tango hardware.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.000]   And when just doing it in software with the existing
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.160]   cameras is good enough for a little--
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:54.640]   Tango came out of the same era as Project AR, which
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.760]   were the smartphones.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:58.120]   There were little modules you could piece together
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.320]   to design your own phone, which they also killed this year.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.360]   I thought that was really cool.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.720]   That's one of the only people that liked that.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.640]   Every time I try to talk to my back, they're like,
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.320]   that's a horrible thing.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.960]   I'm like, I just want to see it.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.440]   I mean, I don't know if what I do with it,
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.520]   but it looked like it was cool.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.160]   Like Lego phone accessory stuff.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.120]   I love the idea.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.160]   You know what's depressing?
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:21.600]   If you go to the Tango site, get.google.com/tango.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.960]   You get a 404.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.880]   They didn't even--
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.240]   they just took it down.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.560]   And March 1 of 2018, it'll be dead dead.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.600]   But come on, Google.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.360]   Put just a little thing.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.000]   It says, oh, thanks for coming.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.880]   Glad you enjoyed it.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.360]   But we're not going to do this anymore.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:43.120]   But instead, no, just 404.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.440]   And this is, by the way, the number one
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:49.160]   results search result I get when I search for Google Tango.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.200]   It's a non-existent Google website.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.800]   Oh my god.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.760]   Google's got to be careful.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.680]   They're really getting a reputation for just abruptly
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.760]   killing technologies.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.240]   And I think what happens is that people then just
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.120]   don't invest in any Google technologies,
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.240]   because they go, oh, I don't know how long this is going to last.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.120]   When do they get tired of this one?
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.440]   I've done it again.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:17.440]   You want to see the top search trends of 2017?
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.440]   This is the most depressing video ever.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.000]   Thank you, Google, for making me sad.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.160]   I'm going to have to walk you through it
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:25.080]   because it's just music.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.440]   This year, more than ever, we asked.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.960]   Here's the things we searched for.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:34.120]   How wildfires start.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.120]   Oh boy.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.280]   How far can North Korean missiles go?
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.200]   Oh boy, how much will the wall cost?
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.680]   Geez, how many refugees in the world?
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:44.880]   Google, how do hurricanes form?
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.560]   How are Babi made?
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.680]   How to board up a window?
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.440]   How to calm a dog during a storm?
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.360]   How to help flood victims?
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.560]   How to help refugees?
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.760]   This is going to get happier, right?
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.280]   How to help Puerto Rico?
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.800]   How to help Mexico?
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.680]   How to help Las Vegas?
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.320]   How to help-- oh, hey.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.560]   Grenful Tower, Rohingya, Syria, Somalia.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.400]   How to make a protest sign?
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.880]   Geez, always.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.520]   I mean, I'm going to ask the question.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.600]   I didn't see how to put Cody on Amazon Firestore.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.440]   I don't really believe this list per se.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.040]   I mean, not to bring a call back to the--
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:24.720]   Is it the number one?
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.040]   I mean, Google's going to say, look, it was depressing here.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.200]   We just have to tell the truth.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.080]   Oh, here's the positives.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.200]   I'm out to watch the eclipse.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:30.720]   There you go.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.440]   OK, here we go.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:31.960]   That was good.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.400]   How not to buy glasses that will blind you on Amazon?
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.840]   No, they didn't-- how to make a difference.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.400]   How to take a knee?
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.720]   How to be a strong woman?
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.720]   Ellen?
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.800]   Is there all the me too?
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.000]   How to be a good parent?
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:47.520]   Aw.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.040]   People Google that?
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:49.640]   No.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.560]   And if you do, I think you maybe
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.880]   should reconsider this whole child thing.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.560]   Hey, Google, how do I be a good parent?
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.080]   Because I got a kid on the way.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.040]   How to be fearless?
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.240]   This isn't a real list then.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.160]   This is them just doing stuff.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.600]   I don't know.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.720]   Now Google's responding with the Google Max.
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.400]   I don't know.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.920]   Are you uplifted by this, depressed by this?
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:13.520]   I don't know.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.320]   It's an interesting challenge if they found out
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.000]   that's what they had to make exciting and inspiring
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:18.960]   rather than depressing.
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.440]   The final search had to move forward.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.680]   This is almost political.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.440]   It's really close to a political statement.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.600]   That is going to be all like all Taylor Swift.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.800]   I think that's the truth.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.360]   That would have been more accurate.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.840]   I'm wondering if it's stuff like that.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.520]   Like this whole thing is just a propaganda, whatever
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.600]   you want to call it.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.720]   Oh, we're people that care about people
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.280]   and people wanted to know how to help everybody.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.360]   And these-- OK.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:42.960]   OK.
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.720]   Just tell me you're making a commercial.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.880]   And I'll be fine with that.
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:50.000]   But don't tell me this was the most searched stuff in 2017.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.200]   This was the year in many ways that Silicon Valley and Google
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.200]   and Facebook and Microsoft and Amazon, people
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.960]   soured a little bit, right?
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.920]   In fact, Aaron Griffith has a good article about this.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.680]   Silicon Valley isn't the hope of the world anymore.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.120]   Do you agree, Dan?
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.640]   Hasn't been for a long time.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.200]   And the difference I think this year
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.680]   is that Silicon Valley is starting
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.840]   to be like the Wall Street in 2009.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:26.920]   It is, isn't it?
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.800]   And that's-- I didn't think it was
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.360]   going to get this far because I didn't really
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   think that the tech people had quite the 10 years
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.040]   that they proved to have at this point.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.520]   But I think they finally know they have a problem.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.640]   And hopefully we'll start working on it more seriously.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.480]   But it's been depressing.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.920]   When this article was first published on Back Channel,
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.120]   the Wired's Back Channel, the title was,
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.040]   "Tekki's Still Think They're the Good Guys.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.320]   They're Not."
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.120]   But I note that it has now changed to the other tech bubble.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:05.600]   Do you think people were like pissed off that she said that?
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.640]   I don't know.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.480]   But I think the message is clear.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.440]   What happened this year?
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.480]   Was it the unicorns?
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.480]   Was it Uber?
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.840]   I think it was a combination of things.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.120]   I mean, certainly Uber is part of it.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:35.640]   But there's a general awareness that social networks have
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.200]   played an incredibly culpable role
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:44.600]   in the kind of degrading of everything in our conversations,
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.600]   in our politics, in the way we relate to each other,
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.200]   as well as doing lots of great stuff.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:58.600]   And I think that the response until recently had been well,
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.840]   and it really wasn't us, and we can't do anything about it.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:06.360]   And I would say also we've got to be careful that we get
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.600]   what we ask for if we really want them to be the editors of the internet.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.040]   I don't.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:18.680]   But there's this general sense that the tech business partly
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.160]   because it's so damn rich.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.720]   And a lot of people throughout this country and the world
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:31.720]   are starting to feel there's something that the power is a little too great.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.240]   Thank you, right.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.480]   In Silicon Valley in 2016, remember in San Francisco,
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:44.440]   people egging the Google bus protesting outside Kevin Rose's apartment,
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.240]   blaming him for what was happening.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.800]   I was about to say, this has been, again, when you live outside of it,
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.800]   it's been a long time coming that this has been going on.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:57.480]   People have been upset with the valley and tech bros for a long time.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.000]   But when you're that rich, you're above it,
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.720]   and you think that you are the good guys, but you're not.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:05.720]   Average people can't afford to live and are living in a shack to serve your burrito
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.000]   because they didn't learn code and you're moving them out of their apartments
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.120]   so that you can have some kid come in and do whatever you want him to do
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.560]   and make stuff that doesn't make any sense.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.600]   I hope you get acquired.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.600]   I mean, it's really a weird thing.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.640]   You got both dagas and companies coming out just doing dumb stuff and paying hard PR people.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:26.200]   So yeah, it's great to live on an island where you think that you're the coolest person in the world
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.960]   and people are giving you money for your idea and maybe you make it, maybe you don't.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.960]   But it's not a reflection of the country.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:37.320]   And as far as the internet being the facilitators for negative connotations,
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.600]   conversations, guess what?
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.880]   There is a guy, forget the baseball game, but the guy blew the call.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.960]   He got 10,000 letters in the first week, 100,000 letters in his lifetime by how he messes up.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.040]   People, people always been ignorant rude.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.480]   They just had to put a standpoint.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.600]   Now they can just click into the world.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.160]   >> It's too easy.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.120]   >> So easy.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:59.720]   >> The world is full of the worst people in the world and the best people in the world.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.480]   >> It's a good, unfortunately.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:01.880]   >> Unfortunately.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.640]   >> You hear a lot more from the worst people.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:09.080]   >> I hope it's a 60/40 ratio because I know there's 10% of the good people just saying,
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.240]   look, I don't even want to be bothered with that.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.680]   But I mean, the world's always been a good and a bad place to internet.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:18.120]   It just lets you see it if that's what you choose to see more so than not.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:22.920]   But people are generally inherently good and hopefully things work out and the blum.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:26.920]   >> The bad news for Uber, which really kind of started in the spring with the Susan Fowler,
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.720]   a blog post that brought down Travis Kalinik continues.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.840]   In the Waymo-Uber case, a letter has been revealed now.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:42.440]   By the way, a letter which came from an Uber employee who has backed down a little bit on
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.080]   some of the claims in actual court testimony.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:51.640]   But the former security employee at Uber said in his letter, this is the kind of thing that was
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:51.960]   going on.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.800]   This comes from Amirah Friday at the information.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.720]   This is his post.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.440]   Unlawfully recording an employee conference call that was supposed to be part of Uber's
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.360]   anonymous and candid listening sessions after the company was accused of sexual harassment
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:10.680]   by Susan Fowler, hiring CIA trained operatives for things like recruiting someone on the senior
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:14.760]   leadership team of Arrival to be Uber's spy.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.280]   They were trained to turn executives from other companies plus recruiting other informants
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:21.080]   who worked at Arrival's.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:25.320]   Uber spoofing, rider and driver accounts to gather data on Arrival's.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:30.280]   Collecting detailed information about people who drove for Arrival's.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.640]   If you drove for Lyft, Uber will know more about you probably than its own drivers.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:39.480]   And 35,000 taxi driver records by hacking or outsmarting software meant to prevent
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.960]   automated downloading of website information.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:47.080]   Uber virtually impersonated protesters and taxi operators in order to gather data about
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:52.920]   politicians, regulators, law enforcement, taxi companies and other possible enemies.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:56.760]   Sometimes by getting invited to their private WhatsApp and Facebook groups,
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.960]   it conducted physical eavesdropping to that effect too.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:05.640]   In one case, putting a bug at a transport regulator meeting so they could listen in.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:12.920]   There were hacking allegations of hacking but those details were redacted, spying on rival
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.080]   executives in private hotel and conference spaces in order to record their reaction to news.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:22.200]   I mean Uber was acting abominably, not just towards its own employees,
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.320]   it's female employees.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.800]   But towards the outside world, we know about Grayball, right?
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:31.720]   There's software that would automatically detect if Arrival or a lot more importantly,
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.720]   a law enforcement officer was trying to get an Uber.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:35.800]   I can't wait for the last time.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:41.560]   All right, I'm as far from being a fan of Uber as you can possibly get.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:46.280]   But that letter is a bunch of allegations.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.560]   Okay, good point.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:53.160]   Not a single one of which I'm aware of anyway that has been shown to be true.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:57.000]   Maybe they're all true or maybe none of them are true or maybe a couple of them are.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:04.360]   I'm really wary of making any assumptions on that particular thing.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:10.920]   I want these people who kind of tends to want to believe the worst about Uber,
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:16.840]   which is why I'm really careful in this case to say, well, I got to see some evidence first.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:23.480]   The letter was written by the attorney of a former Uber security employee, Richard Jacobs,
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:29.160]   and was sent to Uber's general counsel, Angela Padilla, after he left the company.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:33.240]   And it showed up as part of the discovery during the trial.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.680]   You can read the letter if you want.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.280]   Recode has it, but that's a very important caution.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.480]   I'm glad you mentioned that, Dan.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.280]   This is just one person's allegations.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.120]   That's why I said it sounded like a lifetime movie.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:49.800]   I'm like, man, this is a lot like this is like this.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.720]   Oh, this really all this?
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.800]   It was that was extreme.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:32:00.360]   So I am fully backing the whole cautionary tale of let's see some evidence or proof of something
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.320]   because it was that was.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.240]   You kind of come on.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:08.280]   You want to believe it because I don't want to believe it, but I just kind of believe it
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.720]   because of the stuff we already know.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.040]   It doesn't surprise me.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.320]   But some of that I'm like, you hired us.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.640]   Like, so basically you're out here torturing dudes,
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:20.200]   we're all the companies trying to get your car.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.280]   CIA ex, I mean, come on.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.120]   That's, whoa, that's a lot.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.000]   That's a lot.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.320]   I don't know how much of that I believe.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:32.520]   I need to see some evidence, somebody somewhere has got something to prove something.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:33.640]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.520]   When we come back, Facebook admits it's bad for your health.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.800]   That's next, but film at 11.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:43.880]   But before we do that, I'd like to show you a little film.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.000]   You know, we make little films about the week.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.280]   So, you know, it's like for training, we go in the locker room, we watch the films,
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.840]   we review them, and we thought we'd share them with you.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.800]   This is what you missed if you missed anything this week on Twitch.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.520]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.240]   Hi, mom.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.760]   We did a fun thing.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.360]   I think I've mentioned this before.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.120]   We were making pasta one day in the kitchen.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.640]   No, no, I'm telling that.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.000]   I'm telling that.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.600]   Am I allowed to see that on the show?
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.360]   I'm gonna start trying that.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.880]   That's the magic.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:15.720]   This week in computer hardware, the Titan V, the world's first consumer
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:20.360]   voltage GPU with HBM 2, $2,999.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.560]   They call it a consumer graphics card, but this is like calling
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.560]   the Lamborghini a commuter vehicle.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:30.600]   It's a super impressive looking card, but at $3,000, you need to have a business
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.280]   reason to really want this.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.120]   No house.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:38.440]   This is the supplier, which is a very cool device, about 350 bucks.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.320]   This has kind of been my recording studio for the past month.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.120]   It's basically like an eight track recording studio.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.680]   Oh, sugar.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:49.880]   Oh, honey, honey.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.000]   This makes it seem so simple.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.400]   I mean, you don't have to have the talent, but wow.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.120]   To it.
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.600]   Technology for your eyes and ear holes.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.280]   They have to let you visit.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.760]   She's talking about the drop-in feature, which let's...
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.080]   Yes, I'm talking about it.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.320]   Oh, that's my mom.
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.800]   I got scolded this week.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.680]   It's a two year.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.960]   My mom is using his called drop-in.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.360]   No, we're going to visit.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.320]   Okay.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:22.280]   By the way, my mom has come up with the perfect...
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.400]   You know, we always have this problem by saying the A word, the trigger word for
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:26.280]   Amazon's Echo.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.680]   So she said, "I just called..."
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.240]   So from now on, if I say...
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.560]   That's the Amazon trigger.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.720]   I wish I could make an Echo answer to that.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.600]   That would be awesome.
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.840]   Set a timer.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:41.240]   Okay.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.680]   Are you sure?
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.240]   I have my mom.
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.760]   That was actually a great episode.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:47.960]   I got tagged in that.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.440]   The reason I knew someone said,
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.720]   "This is the most fun I've seen with Leo since episode O'Dokta."
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.000]   And I'm like, "Oh, his mom?"
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:55.960]   And I went and watched that.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:56.280]   Wow.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:56.920]   I was cracking up.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.560]   Maybe we should do an O'Dokta Mary Laport episode.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:34:59.960]   That would be...
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.680]   There we go.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:01.160]   There we go.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:01.960]   Bring the two of you together.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:02.440]   We would have...
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.040]   Yeah, we could both yell at you.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.440]   I don't know if the world is ready for that much awesomeness
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.440]   and on one TV screen.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.160]   Your mom seems like a lovely individual.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.920]   That was really fun to watch.
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:12.920]   She's great.
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.640]   She's a star.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.480]   All of a sudden now, people are demanding.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.880]   They're hating me on Twitter, but they love my mom.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.760]   She puts you in your place, no doubt.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.240]   You can't go.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.440]   You think you run the ship?
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.640]   Oh, you don't know.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:31.160]   Our show today brought to you by my doorbell.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.000]   I love my ring video door,
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.600]   but we've had it for almost two years now,
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:35.720]   and I couldn't live without it,
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:38.040]   because well, I use it in a lot of different ways.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.800]   When there are people who come out,
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.720]   neighbors come over and you...
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:42.600]   In the doorbell rings,
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.120]   and I quickly pull out my phone.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:44.760]   I hear it on my phone,
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.160]   which is great.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.920]   The doorbell pairs to the Wi-Fi,
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:47.480]   and I'd say,
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.360]   "Oh, let's see who that is."
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:49.640]   Actually, there's somebody in my door right now.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:51.000]   Oh, I don't want...
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:51.880]   And I don't answer.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.400]   I admit it.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.480]   It keeps you from answering the door when you don't want to.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.680]   Even if you're not home,
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.480]   you get this...
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.480]   I just got one just a minute ago,
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:02.200]   the ring doorbell.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.160]   Somebody's at our front door.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.680]   It has motion sensor in it,
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.680]   so it sees people even before they ring the doorbell.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.640]   When they ring the doorbell,
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.520]   it dings you,
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.280]   but the motion sensor can also notify you.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.880]   There's an HD camera on it,
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:12.760]   a speaker,
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.440]   so you can talk to them in a microphone,
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.560]   so you can hear them.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.080]   So when the UPS guy comes,
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:17.400]   I say,
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:18.920]   "Yeah, I'm in the shower right now."
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:19.880]   I'm actually...
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.760]   This is really showing you how I use it to deceive, isn't it?
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.320]   It's showing you my poor morals here.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.520]   "I'm in the shower right now.
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.640]   Can you leave the package?
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:28.760]   I'll sign for it tomorrow."
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:29.560]   He does it.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:31.720]   Plus, then I can keep an eye on the package,
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.400]   which is really awesome.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.960]   I should show you the Twitter stream,
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:37.480]   the ring Twitter stream,
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:39.240]   because they've started what they started doing.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.440]   It's pretty funny.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.120]   Is posting videos captured by the ring doorbell
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.040]   of people stealing stuff?
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.160]   These are all people who are arrested, by the way.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.960]   This is a ring video guy.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:56.840]   This year doorbell's doing this.
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.600]   Comes, he gets out of his car.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.840]   This is not a bright person,
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.600]   and gets back in the car.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.360]   And we've got clear video.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.240]   So we got them.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.960]   People trying to break in at night.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.000]   This is safety for your home.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.520]   The ring video doorbell.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.200]   Now with a ring floodlight cam,
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:17.000]   you've got the same safety all around your house.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.280]   It's a motion-activated camera and LED floodlight
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:21.480]   that connects to your phone.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.200]   With HD video, two-way audio.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.960]   If somebody steps on your property,
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.720]   the lights come on, you see it.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:31.640]   And if you want, you can talk to them.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.360]   You could say, "Dude, get out of here."
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.400]   And if they don't respond,
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.240]   it even has 110 decibel alarm.
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:38.280]   You could fire from your phone,
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.440]   no matter where you are, anywhere in the world.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:43.160]   Wall Street Journal said it was the best of CES this year.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.280]   The ring floodlight cam, the ring video doorbell.
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.920]   You can get a ring of security kit right now
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.080]   and save up to $150 bucks on it.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.480]   If you go to ring.com/twit,
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:56.680]   all the kits included doorbell,
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.000]   and the choice of either one, two, or three floodlight cams.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.560]   You, by the way, you can connect your ring video doorbell
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.160]   with your favorite smart locks and hubs,
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.520]   if you want to have added convenience monitoring and security.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.280]   You don't have to, but you can.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.520]   With ring, you're always home, no matter where you are.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:13.480]   Save up to $150 dollars on a ring of security kit
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:15.400]   when you go to ring.com/twit.
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.160]   That's ring.com/twit.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.600]   I love this Twitter feed,
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.000]   because it's just a bunch of people.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:23.640]   Here's a guy.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:26.120]   He runs into the garage, steals everything,
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.880]   opens the garage door, runs out.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:30.120]   They got him on this is a floodlight cam shot.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.560]   I love it.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.160]   This guy installed it two weeks earlier.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:36.520]   He got the video.
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:40.920]   Facebook did an interesting thing here.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.720]   This is a post from this week,
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.200]   David Ginsberg, Director of Research at Facebook,
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:48.360]   Moira Burke, Research Scientist at Facebook.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.680]   Hard questions.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.000]   Is spending time on social media bad for us?
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.720]   Give you the TLDR.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:00.040]   Yes.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.440]   But this is stunning that Facebook admits it.
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.280]   But if you keep reading, you'll see why.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:06.760]   The bad.
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:09.160]   In general, it says when people spend a lot of time
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:12.040]   passively consuming, by the way, that's in bold,
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:15.720]   information, reacting, I'm sorry, reading,
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:17.640]   but not interacting with people,
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:20.280]   they report feeling worse afterwards.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.600]   They quote a number of studies at University of Michigan.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.120]   UC San Diego and Yale.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:27.160]   People who clicked on about four times as many links
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.160]   as the average person or like twice as many posts
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.080]   on Facebook reported worse mental health than average in a survey.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.520]   But here's the good news.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.360]   And Facebook would like you to focus on this.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:42.120]   On the other hand, actively interacting with people,
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:45.400]   especially sharing messages, posts and comments
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:49.000]   with close friends reminiscing about past interactions,
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.120]   is linked to improvements in well-being.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.200]   So stop being such a passive consumer on Facebook
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.000]   and start sharing.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.040]   You'll feel better.
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:04.600]   By the way, simply broadcasting status updates was not enough.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:07.960]   People had to interact one-on-one with others in their network.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.760]   Here's a pro tip for Joy.
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.280]   When you're scrolling down Facebook,
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.200]   and you see somebody post a picture with their kid,
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.680]   or their wife, or they update their picture,
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.680]   always click the like button.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.360]   Just always click it every time you see it,
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.160]   no matter what it is.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:25.880]   >> That's a good idea.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:26.920]   >> You see like a family image.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:27.480]   >> People like that.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.760]   >> I always support.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.240]   >> It's like, I have to.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.760]   >> You know how he talks to mine in five years?
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.520]   They put him a picture of their kid, hey, click, hey,
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.800]   that's good, that's nice.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.360]   Thanks for-
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.200]   Look, is there something positive in your mind
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:37.080]   to do while you're scrolling?
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.600]   It costs you nothing for the like.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.960]   It makes them feel good that somebody's enjoying their family.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.640]   So whatever you see, family stuff,
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.480]   you're already scrolling anyway.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.640]   Just click the button and keep it moving.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.640]   Oh, did you do something positive in your mind?
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.520]   It's up for today.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.080]   >> Just do it.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.200]   Here's some more results.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:52.920]   >> What?
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.040]   >> Experimented Cornell,
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.600]   stressed college students randomly assigned
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.120]   to scroll through Facebook,
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.160]   either their Facebook profile or
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.600]   strangers Facebook profile.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:05.240]   People who look at their own profile
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.000]   felt much better.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.200]   Experience boosts in self-affirmation.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.440]   Compared to people who looked at the strangers profile.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.480]   Here's another one.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.640]   Cornell researchers put other students under stress
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.640]   by giving them negative feedback on a test.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:20.360]   Then gave them a choice of websites to visit,
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.040]   including Facebook, YouTube, online music,
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.560]   and online video games.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.440]   Stress students were twice as likely to choose Facebook
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.800]   to make themselves feel better.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.600]   Isn't that a nice story?
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.880]   >> I mean, we were talking about
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.040]   why this has not been a great year for the tech industry.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.400]   I think-
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:38.200]   Stuff like this.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.200]   >> Well, I mean, the year kind of started out
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:43.080]   with Mark Zuckerberg saying that he thought it was crazy
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.160]   for anybody to think that Facebook had any impact.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.600]   On the election.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.800]   And whether it did or did not have any impact on the election,
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:54.120]   saying that he thought it was crazy was so dismissive.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.760]   And I think Facebook is still kind of wanting around,
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:59.720]   trying to get a sense of how to talk to the world about
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:01.000]   Facebook's impact on the world.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.920]   And in this case, they're overcompensating by acknowledging
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.840]   that maybe Facebook is not an entirely good thing.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:10.680]   >> That's how you use it, right?
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.480]   And of course, it's in Facebook's interest that you share more
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.680]   on Facebook, obviously.
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:16.200]   >> I should say I see a-
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.360]   Well, most of the interaction I see between people
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.040]   on my Facebook is positive.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.200]   There's also a fair amount of negative interaction
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.560]   where people are interacting with each other.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:24.360]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:24.920]   >> And-
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.400]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.240]   >> And see a lot of things to each other.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.640]   >> But my feed and your feed are very different.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:30.920]   No two feeds are alike, right?
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.920]   >> Mine is most a good place.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.440]   >> Is that because of who you followed or I guess it is?
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.240]   >> I'm not entirely sure.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.320]   My Twitter is also primarily a nice place.
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.240]   >> But if Twitter you can say clearly,
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.200]   it's because of who you follow,
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:43.480]   because it's less algorithmic.
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:45.480]   But Facebook, you don't really know.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.240]   Facebook's got an algorithm.
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:49.720]   You don't know why Facebook's showing you what they're showing you,
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.120]   and it may not have anything to do with who you follow.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:55.560]   >> And most of the negativity is political and nature,
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:59.080]   and people not have gathering together
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.880]   and having a reason conversation about their differences,
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.840]   but screaming bloody murder at each other.
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:05.880]   >> Facebook suggests-
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:09.400]   Hit the snooze button.
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.440]   >> Hit the snooze button.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.520]   Today we launch snooze,
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:15.720]   which gives people the option to hide a person page or group for 30 days.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.160]   >> You don't unfollow them,
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:17.880]   you don't unfriend them,
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.720]   and I presume they don't know you're snoozing them.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.360]   Hit the snooze button.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:25.560]   Millions of people break up on Facebook each week.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.080]   Change-
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.200]   >> Millions?
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:28.680]   >> Millions.
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.040]   I think it's probably more than that.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:31.240]   They've got 2 billion users,
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.280]   it's probably hundreds of millions.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.520]   Anyway, changing their relationship status from
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:36.280]   in a relationship to single.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:39.160]   Research on people's experiences after breakups
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:42.040]   suggests that online and offline contact,
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.200]   including seeing an ex-partners activities can make emotional recovery
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.800]   more difficult.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.120]   So there's a new tool called Take a Break,
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:51.960]   which gives people more control of
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:54.840]   whether or when they see their ex on Facebook,
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:57.480]   what their ex can see and who can see their passports.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:02.360]   >> This is an effort from Facebook to make sure you don't delete your account.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.080]   That's all this is.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.680]   Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:05.960]   I know you're upset right now.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:06.440]   Relax.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.120]   Just snooze them.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.920]   Don't don't don't don't don't snooze them.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.800]   You can snooze them.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:13.480]   Okay, now back away.
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.960]   Bring that back up.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.560]   Okay, we cool?
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.040]   Okay.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.080]   Okay, good.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:19.880]   You're good.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.280]   It's basically just a mechanism to make sure
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:24.600]   that people don't rage quit Facebook.
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:27.560]   And that's why they instituted this.
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.800]   Because again, Facebook shows you who they want or think you want to see.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.880]   I've got thousands of people I follow.
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:37.000]   I only see 32 people every single day.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.400]   And every once in a blue moon, somebody else cracks the surface.
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.840]   I'm like, oh, you're not dead?
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:41.960]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.480]   So Facebook is just doing this so you don't rage quit them.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:49.160]   Roland in our chair quotes Bishop Barkley says,
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.800]   if everybody snoozes everybody else's Facebook disappear.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:57.640]   >> I don't think it's obviously great, by the way.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.800]   If looking at my own Facebook makes me feel great,
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.400]   because some of the efforts Facebook goes through
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.920]   to make me feel great are so incredibly artificial.
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:09.000]   >> Those videos they send you.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:09.560]   >> Yes.
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.480]   >> Every week, Facebook takes a more active role
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.640]   until we meet and wish my friends a happy birthday.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.760]   For a while, they're even auto filling out the sentiments.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.440]   I could send my friends on their birthdays.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:24.600]   >> It's hard for me not to start,
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.200]   but not this year has been tough,
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:29.400]   but start thinking of Facebook as, frankly,
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:32.680]   a malign influence on our society.
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.760]   >> I don't see of any benefit.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:37.080]   >> There is actual good stuff for me on Facebook too.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:39.560]   There are instances of my friends being nice to be in a way,
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.000]   which I'm fairly sure was not manufactured by Facebook.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.400]   >> I like your stuff, but wouldn't it be better to call them
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.240]   and maybe go have a drink together?
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.720]   Or I just feel like it's such an artificial environment.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.280]   And I just, who's going to defend Facebook?
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.640]   Anybody want to defend Facebook?
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.560]   Say, I get so much value out of it.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.480]   >> I think Facebook at its best is everything they say about
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:08.840]   Facebook being good is true, in some cases.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.880]   I think in some cases it is a profoundly good thing.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.480]   >> Has it changed the world in a positive way?
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.440]   >> It has because it's opened up windows and avenues for people
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.760]   that never had an opportunity to see the world,
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:24.280]   reach the world, view the world.
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.200]   They're building space planes to bring internet to underdeveloped countries.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.800]   There are a lot of positive things to talk about.
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.120]   At the end of the day, it comes down to the individual.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.280]   Okay, first things first when I was in the hospital, again, my phone was dying.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.800]   So I posted on Instagram, like, hey, because I was sick all day.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:41.880]   I was like, grandma, I was looking for my phone was dead, but I'm here.
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:45.480]   People knew where I was and they knew what was going on.
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:48.120]   So people weren't worried about when I disappeared for a day.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.000]   >> That's a good use.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:49.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.920]   >> And secondly, again, it goes down to personal usage.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:58.360]   My daughter comes to me and she says, dad, how do I make a new Instagram name?
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.720]   And I said, why do you want to do that?
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.560]   She said, well, all my friends did it.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.320]   I said, well, why did your friends do it?
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:07.000]   Oh, they wanted to do a thing so they could get more followers and they think they need to
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:07.880]   change their name.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.000]   And I said, well, if you change your name, you're putting up the same content.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.360]   Do you think it's going to do any better for you just because you have a name change?
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:18.280]   She's like, no, I said, wouldn't you want to just change your content on the name you have
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.640]   and grow that filing?
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:20.680]   She said, yes.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.040]   And so she didn't change her name.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.880]   These are conversations that I have with my child when she talks to her friends and says,
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:27.720]   it's not about how many likes you get.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.600]   It's about what you put up and if you had fun and you liked it yourself.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:33.880]   Why? Because I've taught that to her and I've instilled that in her to which she
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.960]   in turn instills into her other friends.
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:40.600]   So as people, we need to do better with the technology and the devices we have.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:43.560]   So that's that in my perspective.
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.680]   >> All right.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:50.440]   Nuff said, Twitter has announced support for threading in tweets.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.680]   Now you can really do tweet storms better.
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.200]   I don't know if that's a good thing.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:58.920]   I have to say, we were all very worried about 280 character tweets and that's turned out to be
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.240]   great.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:47:59.720]   Yes.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:00.440]   >> Yes.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:00.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.240]   People aren't over tweeting.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.240]   They're still trying to be concise.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:10.760]   But when you need a little extra to say something instead of crazy abbreviations and
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.480]   kind of cryptic hashtags, you can say it.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.320]   You disagree?
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.560]   You think you'd rather see short Twitter back?
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:20.680]   >> I think I like short Twitter.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:23.400]   I think the spirit of 140 should live on.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.680]   At first, I was only going to do 140.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:29.480]   Then I realized it because they don't give you a count, but sure that little circle,
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:30.120]   it's very hard.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:30.600]   >> I can't tell.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:31.480]   >> I actually started that.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.040]   >> I can't tell.
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:37.080]   >> I'm trying to make a little circle go no further than a rough leg at the bottom point.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.400]   >> Did you succeed?
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:41.640]   >> And for the most part, yeah.
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.800]   >> I think be as concise as you need, but you've got a little more room.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.400]   Be as concise as you can, but use the space you need if you need it.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:53.240]   I've been accidentally tweet storming because it's very easily to accidentally append.
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.880]   >> Show me how that works because I don't know.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:56.680]   So if I make it-
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:59.160]   >> When you do a tweet, there's a little plus sign which lets you do more.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.480]   And some people like tweet storms say that this is actually not good because when you do a
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.040]   tweet storm the old way, people start to respond to you.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:11.560]   And by the time you finish your tweet storm, you've taken into consideration other Twitter users.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:15.560]   And this thing is designed to let you compose all your tweets without seeing how people are reacting.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.360]   >> So did I close it prematurely?
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.400]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.280]   >> Start a tweet.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.560]   >> I did. I sent a tweet.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.520]   This is my first tweet.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.280]   >> Go back and start a new one.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:25.160]   >> Start a new tweet.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:25.800]   Okay.
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:26.760]   >> Say something.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.880]   >> This is my second tweet.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:32.360]   >> And there's a little plus sign next to your tweet button.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.240]   >> And now I can do more.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.520]   >> And another tweet.
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.960]   This is the third tweet.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.240]   >> And you can just keep on doing that.
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.920]   >> Magic.
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.680]   >> There's a way to queue up a bunch of tweets.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:43.720]   >> I pressed send.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.080]   I got to stop pressing send.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.440]   >> You do.
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:47.800]   >> Oh, man.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.960]   Okay. So you could, how many can you do?
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:50.680]   Is there a limit?
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.800]   >> I believe there's no limit.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.960]   >> I'm not a fan of the tweet storm.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:58.680]   In fact, what I feel like these days, people instead of writing a blog post,
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:00.680]   they'll tweet 40 tweets.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:02.040]   >> The other thing I have to go read them.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:02.680]   Don't you hate that?
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:07.080]   >> The other thing they did, which in some ways is better is if you're looking at a tweet
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:11.560]   that's part of a tweet storm, there's a link now that lets you go to the top of that thread.
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:12.920]   >> That would help.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:14.200]   At least I could read them in order.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:20.200]   When you're live tweeting a movie and ruining Star Wars for people, this comes in handy.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.400]   >> I did live tweet the projector stopping, but I didn't tell any spoilers.
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:26.440]   So you think it's a bad trend, Dan?
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:32.920]   >> I was against the 280 also, and then I totally changed my mind.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:41.560]   Sometimes it's much better to capture a little bit of nuance that's almost impossible to do in 140.
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:47.240]   I have not used this tweet storm feature in at least the new thing,
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.640]   but I don't do them that often.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:56.120]   And I completely agree with you that it's a form that should never have to have been invented.
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:57.320]   It would be better if people.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:57.880]   >> Yeah.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:00.280]   >> Yeah, just do a blog post, okay?
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:00.920]   Thank you.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.280]   And then point to it on Twitter.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.800]   I'll click.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.360]   I really will.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:09.960]   I do feel like the reason they're doing this is as Twitter is done with everything,
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:14.120]   the @reply, the hashtag is, that's what people were doing.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:15.320]   So they add features.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:17.320]   I mean, they didn't have hashtags until Christmas,
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:19.800]   Cena did it and it started to be adopted.
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.000]   They didn't have @ replies.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.840]   I've been tweeting along enough from where you didn't have an @reply.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:28.200]   So all that is response to how users use Twitter.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:28.680]   So I guess-
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.720]   >> Get off my long grandpa things have to change.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:34.040]   >> Twitter is funny though.
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:37.400]   You don't want to, you got to change, obviously, but you don't want to change it too much, right?
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:37.960]   >> Yeah.
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:40.760]   >> There's the strength of Twitter, there's a certain value to Twitter in it being-
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:41.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.840]   >> Let Twitter be Twitter.
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:44.120]   >> Have you seen our new commercial?
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:47.560]   I saw, I don't know if it's the first commercial, it's the first one I can remember,
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:50.040]   but I saw it at a commercial the other day and it was-
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.160]   >> A commercial for Twitter?
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:52.120]   >> Yeah.
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.240]   >> Is this the one for real?
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:53.400]   >> For real?
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.360]   >> For Chance the rapper in it?
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:59.480]   >> This is one with a guy, I think maybe his house is on fire or something.
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.320]   There's a guy with a blow horn, he comes up and he-
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.280]   No, it's not on fire.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.920]   The guy wants to set up a Twitter account and-
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.600]   >> So they have-
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:10.360]   >> He's got a guy who watches the window and he names his cell Kenny G and he's like,
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.600]   "I think that's already taken or something stupid."
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:17.080]   >> So I get this is a Twitter ad from June, here's one.
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:20.360]   Hilarious new ad, oh, it's hilarious, oh, this is the bull horn.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.400]   >> There it is, there you go.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:22.600]   >> All right, shall we watch it?
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:23.560]   Let's watch it.
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:24.200]   >> It's not great.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:28.520]   >> Well, too late, I like watching things, it's not great, okay.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:31.560]   So scary clown marionettes, house on fire.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.440]   >> Stand this.
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:33.160]   >> He doesn't know what's-
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.600]   >> Where is he?
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:39.320]   >> Second floor, guy's a mess.
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:41.240]   >> This doesn't make any sense.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:42.360]   >> He's trying to read a Twitter.
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:44.600]   >> He's trying to learn how to tweet.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:45.240]   >> Roll my own.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:48.840]   >> Kevin, I'm here to help.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.840]   Don't worry, it's just Twitter.
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:53.320]   >> But how do I even get started?
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:55.240]   >> Just press the button and pick a name.
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:57.320]   Come on, Kevin, let's go Twitter.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:01.480]   >> My name's not Kevin, it's Kenny, Kenny G.
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.480]   >> Hold on, your name is Kenny G.
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:05.480]   >> The name's already taken.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.480]   >> Yeah, I'm less surprising you are.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.520]   >> I should just crap.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:11.480]   >> How about notorious Kenny G?
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:15.880]   >> It's available, I do like that.
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:17.320]   Now it wants to know my interest.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.640]   Entertainment comic books.
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:22.360]   >> So this is directly addressed at the problem Twitter's
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.240]   head with onboarding.
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.560]   >> I'm a follow up in the lady, I'm here, that likes geeos.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.800]   >> Who doesn't love geeos?
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:29.480]   >> Many, many people.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.680]   >> I like geeos.
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:32.760]   >> Kenny, keep following.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:34.360]   >> Joe Bruin.
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:36.920]   >> Can you pop?
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.440]   >> Thanks for the follow.
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.240]   >> Come on, Kenny, you need to come out here and follow everyone.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:44.440]   >> You can do it, just follow all.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:48.280]   >> Oh, no, okay.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:55.320]   That's really interesting.
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:57.720]   So this is Twitter directly responding to the
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:59.640]   problems it's had with gross, right?
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:02.120]   >> To be fair, the ad I saw was only like 10 seconds.
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:03.000]   I didn't see that fool.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.600]   >> This is a flag made it better.
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:05.320]   That was better.
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.600]   >> A minute and 30.
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.080]   >> It's one of your content.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:09.640]   >> But it's about how to sign up for Twitter, I kind of like it.
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:10.520]   >> Yeah.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:11.400]   >> Where are we going to see it?
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.400]   By the way, that's-
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.560]   >> On crackle when you're binge watching
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:16.680]   startups season two.
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:17.720]   >> They're not buying the Super Bowl.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:18.280]   Maybe they will.
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.120]   You think they'll be buying the Super Bowl for this one?
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:23.960]   The guy with the bullhorn is a comedian,
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:27.160]   Romesh Ranganeth, and I didn't know that, but so.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.480]   They hired a comedian to do it.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:33.800]   Made it extra funny.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:34.840]   There's another one you want to see?
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:37.160]   >> Another ad?
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:37.960]   What do they do?
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.960]   >> They're not even paying for these ads.
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:40.840]   Here's another one.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:42.440]   Let's go Twitter, explore.
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.920]   Okay, this is how you explore on Twitter.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:45.400]   >> Why do?
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:49.560]   >> He's running down the road.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:49.560]   >> How do I explore?
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:49.560]   >> The road.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.400]   >> Don't worry mate, it's just Twitter.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.920]   >> The guy going by in a-
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.040]   >> I hope you don't mind the company,
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:54.840]   but I'm just-
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:55.320]   >> That guy.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:56.360]   >> Who are you?
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:56.920]   >> The guy.
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:57.400]   >> Don't worry about that.
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:59.560]   >> Is that one of those weird segues that doesn't have handles?
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:00.120]   >> This is what I needed to do.
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:02.040]   Just click on the little magnifying glass thing there.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:03.320]   >> I think I can do this.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:05.000]   >> Come on, let's go exploring together.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:05.400]   >> Okay.
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:07.640]   >> Your back is very sweaty, but I'm so excited about this.
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:08.520]   I'm going to ignore that.
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:08.840]   >> Okay.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:11.240]   >> They're doing really well.
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:11.800]   >> Thanks man.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:12.920]   >> Just keep stalling.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:13.480]   It's going to be wicked.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:14.920]   >> I feel like that might be Adler, right?
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:18.440]   >> Whoa, Candace Parker?
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:19.560]   >> It's the explore tab.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.400]   >> Listen to Candace, explore.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.120]   >> Astronauts, nice.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.480]   >> Do you into ninjas?
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:25.960]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.160]   >> That's it, keep exploring.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.760]   >> So this really, I mean, it's-
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:29.560]   >> These things I like.
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:32.280]   >> This is the first time I've seen a Twitter ad that actually made sense.
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.800]   Like this is how you use Twitter.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.520]   >> You just lost a Twitter.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:34.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:36.840]   >> Wow, that's rad.
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:37.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:38.520]   >> And they're constantly evolving.
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:39.080]   >> Will this work?
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:39.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.680]   >> You think they're people who don't use Twitter because they don't know how to use
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:48.280]   Twitter and they're just dying to use Twitter and they're gonna now?
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:51.160]   >> You gotta try, right?
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:53.560]   I don't know if they're going to because of this ad, but I mean,
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.600]   maybe somebody sees and wants to give it a try.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:57.720]   That's the whole point of advertising.
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:58.920]   I don't know if it's gonna work.
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:03.480]   And I'm a Twitter user, so I can't even speculate on that usage.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.680]   But there is a vast difference between the average person
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:09.400]   that uses Facebook versus the average person that's on Twitter.
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.440]   >> Yeah, it's harder to use.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:13.160]   >> Here's a little tip, maybe Twitter should make an ad on this.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.280]   If you see a video with Baby Poop, don't click on it.
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:18.760]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:19.560]   >> What?
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:24.440]   >> Twitter, Baby Poop Video launches spam.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:31.160]   >> So it's a video that looks to be a video of a kid and I don't know what.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:35.080]   And it says, "Baby Poops and his onesie, but dog's response leaves million."
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.160]   And then you gotta click it now.
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.840]   >> I double dare you.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:43.320]   >> No, it's a malicious app that gets used gains,
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.640]   used to your access to your Twitter feed, spamming links from a viral video website.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:51.720]   So by the way, people got bit by this Fox News pundit, Brit Hume,
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:56.920]   New York Times literary critic Dwight Garner, at least two people who have an interest in Baby Poop.
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:00.280]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:04.680]   >> So here's the key, folks, if you're new to Twitter, if you've been watching the ads and you
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:08.920]   say, I want to be on Twitter, if you click on something that says,
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:12.840]   now you need to connect to your Twitter account, don't.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:13.400]   >> Don't.
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.520]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:15.080]   >> Simple enough.
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.440]   >> But yeah.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:20.600]   >> If it says, this can tweet on your behalf, don't, because it will.
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:29.640]   >> All right, the Mariah botnet, man, this was a big story a year ago, October 2016,
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:40.840]   a botnet of 600,000 bots mostly made up of commandeered, poorly secured routers and
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:43.240]   internet video cameras, IoT cameras.
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:48.440]   It turns out, I think at the time, what do you, do you remember this, Mariah Net?
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:55.720]   And remember, brought down D, dying DYN, big internet DNS server and brought down big chunks
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:59.000]   of the net? And I thought at the time, because it was right before the election, oh, this is,
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:05.160]   you know, a state actor, right? Something like, something like North Korea is doing now,
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:07.080]   is some guy in his Rutgers dorm room.
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:07.960]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:12.600]   >> Some guy who apparently, it was not even super sophisticated, it was just kind of clever.
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:13.560]   >> [SOUND]
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:14.440]   >> Not a bright guy.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:17.800]   >> Not a bright guy, kind of the motto of this show.
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:22.360]   >> A guy who wanted to make money by helping people get rid of their Minecraft enemies.
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:25.960]   >> Yeah, so you, I guess there are Minecraft servers. First, they started by running Minecraft
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:32.280]   servers. He was a Rutgers student and three friends, all in their 20s. And first, they were
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:34.920]   running a Minecraft server, making a little money on that. But then when they discovered
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:40.440]   was that some of these Minecraft games like Capture the Flag, you can win if you can get your
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:47.800]   opponent off the net. So they created a custom tool that you could rent to DDoS the guy you're
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:52.360]   playing with. And he's knocked off the net and you win. Which is not very nice.
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:59.480]   Not very, very cool. But then they thought, they had an antenna to bring down the internet.
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:01.240]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.200]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:06.760]   >> They thought, there was a market for this DDoS for hire service,
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:17.000]   called a VDOS. And I guess they were starting to make some money on this. They were renting it out.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:26.520]   And eventually, it got bigger than they ever realized. The security industry was really not
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:31.000]   aware of the threat until mid September. They figured out how to stitch together multiple
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.880]   exploits with multiple processors. They were kind of sophisticated, right? And they got over
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:43.880]   100,000 bots. And then from there, they went to 200,000 to 300,000 infections. And ultimately,
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:50.440]   at the end of it, it was 600,000 bots. The FBI says, these kids are super smart,
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:55.240]   but they didn't do anything high level. They just had a good idea. They didn't really hack
[01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:01.720]   these devices. These were such poorly designed internet of things devices. They had hardwired,
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:05.800]   log in and password. >> It was easy. >> It was easy. So they searched for them,
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:11.480]   found them, took them over. They infected devices all over the world, but particularly
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:19.240]   Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, and China. Some of the world's top manufacturers of consumer electronics
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:23.240]   lack sufficient security practices to mitigate threats like Mariah. In other words,
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.600]   hardwired passwords, and they didn't have any way to update the firmware.
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:32.040]   >> I'd say it's more than some. I think it's probably almost all.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:34.680]   >> It's very common. Yeah. >> It's amazing.
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:42.440]   Mariah was an insane amount of firepower than one security expert. It was just these kids.
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:49.480]   It was just these kids. They even blocked or blasted Brian Krebs' blog,
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:56.680]   knocking it off for four days. They took down Akamai, which Krebs had been using
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:01.480]   to mitigate DDoS, one of the largest bandwidth providers on the internet.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:04.440]   They actually had a drop Krebs site. Remember that? Because they said,
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:12.200]   "We can't afford to protect you against this." Just some guy in the Rutgers dorm room. It's
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:17.000]   always. This was unsealed during the prosecution. So the FBI caught them.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:24.120]   I guess they're prosecuting. But wow. That was kind of revelation.
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.800]   Can I make a request? >> Yes.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:32.040]   >> After we get done, talk about WordPress. Can we talk about these Amazon stories,
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:38.120]   like the Target acquisition and the Google and Amazon talking about YouTube?
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:42.360]   Before we get out of here today, I'd like to hear your opinion on it.
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:46.680]   >> Yes. Absolutely. A couple more stories, and we will take a break.
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:49.560]   Yeah. Oh, you know what? We should take a break now, shouldn't we? We're at the two-hour mark.
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:53.240]   Good thinking. Oh, and JJ Stone. Oh, doctor.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.200]   I'm here. I'm here for you, Uncle Ben. >> Always good on the timing.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:00.360]   Our show today brought to you by WordPress, who brings you my blog, leoleport.com.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:04.200]   I am a big fan of WordPress, started using it way back in the early days with Matt Mullenweg.
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:09.320]   I ran my own WordPress server for years. I finally moved to WordPress.com because I realized
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:14.520]   A, it was less expensive to let them do the hosting. And B, I didn't have to spend any time
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:19.240]   managing the software, patching the stuff, installing plugins. They did all the work.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:24.120]   And I love it. Plus with WordPress.com, you're now in a community
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:29.640]   where other WordPress.com people can follow you and share your site. It helps
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:35.640]   promote you WordPress.com. You know, 29% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress,
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:38.920]   some of the biggest websites. You know that Facebook blog post I was just showing you?
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:43.240]   Facebook announcing, you know, it's better if you use Facebook, if you share. That was on
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:50.520]   WordPress.com site. Facebook uses WordPress.com. WordPress is great, whether you're creating a
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:55.640]   personal blog, a business site. In fact, if you're in a business and you don't have a website yet,

[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:56.360]   But you got to go to that page, WordPress.com/twit. NASA says, astronauts will watch the last Jedi
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:02.840]   in space. I think that's very cool. They will be screening it at the International Space Station.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:11.480]   Very cool. A short little snippet, snippet time. Then we'll get to your Amazon store,
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:17.080]   because I know you want to do this. Patreon. We talked about Patreon and the fact that
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:27.240]   they were going to change the way fees worked on Patreon, that it was going to charge patrons
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:35.800]   a lot to support creators. And creators are upset because they were losing patrons.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:40.520]   Patrons are upset because when they wanted to do a small, like a $1 pledge, we'd end up
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:46.920]   costing them a buck 50 because Patreon was planning on setting them the fees instead of the creator.
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:51.160]   Sorry, my daughter keeps calling me. She doesn't really know my work schedule. It's okay.
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:57.720]   Well, Jack Cottie to his credit. And I think they did this because they had taken venture
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:02.280]   capital. I think they needed to get their profits up a little bit higher. Said, "We best
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:07.320]   up. We're sorry. We're not rolling out the fees change." I hope it's not too late. I think some
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:13.400]   creators did abandon the Patreon platform. Gabe YouTube, for instance, now has a subscription plan.
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:19.880]   I know that Kickstarter had rolled something out. So I think if anything, it's going to expand the
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:26.040]   crowdfunding universe. But I like Jack and I like Patreon. And I know a lot of people use
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:31.800]   Patreon. I hope they can weather this. At least they listened and they did the right thing.
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:38.360]   My only suggestion would have been, hey, why don't you should have started off with a smaller
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:43.640]   jab to the stomach. You don't pull an axe and stick it some ways back. You take a pinpoint
[02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:48.600]   needle in your jab like two or three times and see if they survive before you just come out.
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:51.480]   We lose an axe trying to save somebody's head off.
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:58.920]   Pokémon's flow. That fee was extreme. Yeah. Do you do Patreon stuff? Yes, I do.
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:03.640]   So did you get? Sadly, I've been down for the last month. So I haven't created content.
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:06.600]   iPod does and people aren't coming back to you in the new year. I apologize.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:09.960]   But you didn't hear from your donors that they were upset.
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:14.520]   Oh, I got two or three people that are like, "Hey, bro, I can't afford it. I'm sorry."
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:18.920]   Can't do it. Yeah. That's permanent, right? Those people aren't going to come back. Maybe they will.
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:22.680]   I got their email. I'm going to email them, let them know about the world. Other than they come back
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:27.400]   or not. I always tell people, "If you give me something great, I always have no time." If you're
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:31.880]   broke, just hit the subscribe button and follow me because I understand people don't have money to
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:37.560]   donate money out all the time either. So there's also free ways to support. I appreciate that too.
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:44.600]   So your story, which is kind of a surprise. Amazon is going to start selling once again Apple TV
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:50.360]   and Google Chromecast on their site. They didn't for the longest time. It competes against Fire TV.
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:53.640]   Why? And what do you think that means, Owen?
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:07:01.080]   Amazon, the same reason I want to talk about the target deal, Amazon wants to sell everything.
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:07.880]   They have something that's in direct competition with them, but it also sells like hotcakes,
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:12.200]   but it also relates to their other products because some of their products say, "Oh, we work with
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:17.240]   Google Home and then people see that they can't buy it all there in a bundle. They might go somewhere
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:22.600]   else and buy that option as a bundle package." So they want to sell everything. They need to
[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:26.360]   sell everything. So I feel like that's why they're bringing it back in-house so they don't lose
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:33.800]   opportunities with all these smart home devices for a person that might not want Amazon, Alexa,
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:41.800]   Echo, whatever. That's it. I always stunt myself because I'm trying not to say it.
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:44.520]   Yeah. I will bring HUHU into the brain.
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:50.680]   Yeah, I don't understand why Amazon stopped selling. I mean, certainly any retailer can
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:57.080]   choose not to sell a product. Oh, it seems silly. It seems silly.
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:04.200]   But now they have an incentive to start doing that because YouTube made it impossible for
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:11.800]   YouTube to work on Amazon's Echo Show. And that hurt us because people could watch our videos by
[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:17.640]   saying, "HUHU, watch Twit Live on YouTube and you used to be able to watch the video. Now you
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:21.800]   can't. You can get the audio, but you can't watch the video." And that was a back and forth thing.
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:25.080]   Is that going to change? You think YouTube will work again with Amazon?
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:28.440]   I mean, it sounds like Amazon traded dude. Something to show that they had some good faith
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:33.880]   they wanted to work together. I hope they do. I hope work it out, guys, because I want our
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:37.240]   viewers to be able to use, not that the Echo Show probably aren't that many.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:43.640]   Of course, this is all a sign that these devices are a lot less open and free than PCs or even
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:50.200]   an iPhone or iPad that the fact that YouTube can block this new class of devices from displaying
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:55.720]   its content. Yeah, remember the open internet? It was really fun. Oh, last time. It was good.
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:02.840]   Those were the days, my friends. And now, and you mentioned that this target is buying shipped.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:06.600]   By the way, not the best name for a company. I'm just saying.
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:16.600]   But I ship my pants. Yeah, I shipped my pants. Yeah. Yeah. That was great. I forgot about
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:19.960]   Kmart. I went bought something just because that commercial. I was like one of the greatest
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:25.560]   commercial. You ship it? I shipped the bed. You ship the bed. Yeah, ship it. But this is not
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:28.200]   that ships. This is a different ship. This is not that. This is different.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:37.880]   SHIPT $550 million. Recode says it's to fight back against Amazon. Oh, and what do they say?
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:41.240]   What does that mean? Do you know about SHIPT? I've never heard of them.
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:47.800]   So again, basically, target had issues before they. I know a lot of people that
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:53.560]   shop at Target, love Target. I get target. Target got hacked and a lot of people jump
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:58.440]   ship from using their card or kept them from or anything. So they need to bolster that
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:03.160]   digital marketing and digital bread back on and offer something that's competitive. Because
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:09.720]   again, Amazon is eating the planet. And at some point, if you're a retailer, Walmart's fighting
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:15.080]   back with a two-day shipping. Yeah. Yeah. And they want to come deliver stuff in my house,
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:19.560]   which nobody's going to let them do. But grocery got to try and find their way to survive.
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:26.440]   So Amazon bought Whole Foods and Instacart, which is still independent, was the Whole Foods
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:32.520]   Delivery Service. SHIPT was kind of the anti-Instacart. They're a grocery delivery service,
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:37.160]   but it's with interesting. I don't ever, maybe because I'm in California, but
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:43.400]   Harris Teeter. I don't know that. Myger, Myger, and Texas grocery giant, H-E-B.
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:49.800]   So this is Target. Not a Witcher in my area. Not a button in my area. So this gets target into that
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:54.440]   delivery, same day delivery thing. And Amazon, I mean, it feels like about half the stuff I see
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:58.920]   on Amazon. Amazon can now get to me same day, which was not true a year ago.
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:04.360]   It's really ramping up. And it makes it way more compelling as an alternative.
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.760]   Should we as consumers, Myger? Okay. Myger. MEI JER has pronounced Myger.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:13.400]   Should we as consumers be rooting for these other guys? Because I fear the day when Amazon
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:20.520]   literally does what you said, Owen, have a piece of every transaction online. And we have,
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:25.160]   suddenly that monopoly means we're out of control. We should certainly be rooting for
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:29.800]   companies. We should be rooting, absolutely. Yeah. They're secretly doing what Walmart did.
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:35.080]   I have a friend who his family business is something benign. His family business made
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:39.800]   of fitting for pipes. They were one of only two companies in the country that made this
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:44.520]   fitting because not that many people need it. But it's an industry of their own. They make
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:49.880]   a lot of money with this. Amazon came in, bought their whole inventory. Then the next year,
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:55.480]   they bought the company and now they work for Amazon. And now Amazon has bought the other company,
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:00.920]   and they own a monopoly on these pieces for these pipes. So there are only people that you can get
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:06.120]   them from and they can charge whatever they want and they get a piece of it. And that's just one
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:09.080]   instance of a company I knew the person personally. I'm thinking how many people are they doing
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:12.760]   that to? Because that's what Walmart does. They say, my mom and pop shop, you make these beads?
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:16.280]   Cool, we need 10,000 of them. Wow, I'm gonna stop selling everybody else. I'll only sell to
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:20.120]   Walmart. The next year, Walmart was like, cool, we're gonna buy all of them. And now we're only
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:24.680]   gonna pay you half the price because you don't have customers anymore. Let's go. And it says
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:30.040]   Amazon is just a secret beast on the globe and they just want to nip them down everybody.
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:34.840]   I think you right. I think that will happen. Last story. I wish we had Clayton Morris here
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.920]   for this because Clayton, oh, anytime he's on, he says, Leo, UFOs are real. I am not a believer.
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:47.640]   I'm not a believer. I concur. You think that you're the only being in this universe? That's just silly,
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:52.200]   sir. Continue. I'm not saying there's no life elsewhere in the universe. I'm not saying that.
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:57.960]   But I'm saying there's well anyway, it turns out that Air Force has for years had a secret
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:04.840]   program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. It was in the DOD budget,
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:10.120]   but it was hidden dark money, $22 million over the last few years. The Defense Department never
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:13.560]   acknowledged it. Shut it down in 2012. It was Harry Reid who started it.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:21.320]   But Harry was influenced by his billionaire entrepreneur friend Robert Bigelow, who continues
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:28.760]   the program. Bigelow is convinced absolutely convinced aliens exist and that UFOs have visited
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:35.240]   the Earth. Three, of course, as retired from Congress. He says, I'm not ashamed or embarrassed
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:38.600]   or sorry. I got this thing going. It's I think it was one of the good things I did in my congressional
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:46.040]   service. I did something no one else has done before. He did it with Ted Stevens of the Internet
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:52.280]   as a series of tubes fame, the late Alaska Republican Senator and Daniel Inouye from Hawaii both
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:58.040]   have passed away. They had a secret meeting in which they agreed to fund this with dark money.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:03.880]   Apparently it's no longer funded, but the search still goes on. There is a reasonable reason,
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:09.880]   a reasonable thing if you ask me for the DoD to do this because they're not necessarily
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:15.160]   asserting that it's aliens. It's flying saucers. What if it's a foreign power that has some
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:19.960]   amazing technology? We should at least investigate why Air Force pilots are seeing
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:26.040]   hyperspeed things flying around. But I think in most cases, come on. It's optical illusions. What
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:32.600]   do you think? You believe in UFOs? I'm not talking about life in the universe. That's different.
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:42.600]   There was a giant Air Force study of UFOs in the late '60s, early '70s.
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:47.080]   Yeah. It went through '47 through '69. Project Blue Book.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:53.800]   It was an amazing thing. I know about it because my father worked on it.
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:57.480]   No kidding. No kidding. Yeah. He was the editor of the thing.
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:00.200]   What? Yeah. That's cool.
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:07.080]   Anyway, this survey study has been going on a long time and
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:14.760]   doesn't bother me if people want to study these things. I think that you might learn a lot of
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:21.800]   ancillary information about other kinds of stuff, as you point out, in the process. But why hide it?
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:31.160]   The Project Blue Book investigated 12,000 claimed UFO sightings in its 22-year period.
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:33.880]   Pretty amazing. Your dad was the editor of that.
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:37.000]   Of the final report, yeah. Wow.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.680]   Was he in the Air Force or was he a journalist? What was his background?
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:51.400]   Well, he was in the Air Force during World War II. But this was a project he took on as a freelancer.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:52.200]   Interesting.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.160]   Yeah. Did he tell you about it at the time?
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:16:00.200]   Oh, yeah. So it wasn't there was no secret. It wasn't secret. Okay.
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:09.160]   Well, so far they haven't has anybody found anything? Clayton says they have, but they but
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:17.320]   they're not telling us. I don't know about that. That's that's the that would only be the biggest
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:25.560]   piece of news in history. Yeah. I mean, I believe there has to be life elsewhere.
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:26.040]   Right.
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:32.520]   And probably even in our solar system. But if they had found life elsewhere, we'd know at this point.
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:33.240]   I would think so.
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:37.720]   Technically, it just could have been anything because it's just unidentified flying objects.
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:41.800]   I mean, somebody could have been making a drone back in the 80s and you're wondering why this light's
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:46.760]   blinking in a flew away. And so I was just hoping that when you were going to say,
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:51.160]   yeah, I've seen when I've been abducted, I was just hoping I was just hoping.
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:57.560]   Unfortunately, you know, aliens don't kidnap my people. That's not how that usually is.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:01.880]   Is that actually true? That's interesting. A statistic I'd like to investigate.
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:06.600]   Oh, I can I can give you a whole list of things that don't happen to my people. I guess, you know,
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:10.120]   like in Philly, they kidnapped this little black girl. They brought her back because you just don't
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:15.720]   kidnap black kids. It's not worth it. It's a problem. You know, she I forget she's saying Jesus.
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:22.360]   Jesus on she she sung church hymns for an hour and a half and then they just brought her back because
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:27.240]   she just. I'm saying, like, yeah, she put them.
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:28.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.760]   I mean, when any part of it, they brought her back.
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:36.680]   I can give you a list of stuff that just generally doesn't happen as an abduction is one of them.
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:43.080]   According to the Daily Mail, the bastion of truth, the cigar shaped interstellar comment
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:49.320]   that is currently in our solar system. It has the best name ever because it was discovered in Hawaii.
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:56.520]   Umua, mua. One leading astronomer, according to the Daily Mail says it's an alien probe with
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:05.560]   broken engines. So if you see, umua, mua around about Jupiter, it's going 196,000 miles.
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:13.320]   It's 260 feet wide a mile long. So it's just this big cigar. Uh, we actually said he is
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:19.480]   to aiming his telescopes at it to see if there's any, uh, any, uh, radio waves coming out of it.
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:23.480]   Is that at windows? We don't know. I don't know.
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:27.960]   You know, maybe aliens don't need windows. Maybe they could see through rock. We don't know.
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:30.600]   Time to like a man. They use a Mac.
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:38.120]   That's a good use. That's a very good use. Yeah. Yeah. No, no windows. Just a Mac.
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:43.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, I will now come, I will conclude with a mua mua mua. And thank you all
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:49.800]   for a jalene's user Mac. I got it. I just got it. They don't use windows. It's good. I got it.

[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:49.720]   Ballis here, Jason Howell, Megan Moroney and I, we talked about, and me, we talked about the big stories
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:58.520]   of 2017. And, uh, and it was a fun episode. The following Sunday, we release our best of, which
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:04.760]   some of the best moments. Thanks to you, you chosen by our fans from the 2017, uh,
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:11.240]   Twits. And I will be back in studio here to do another live twit on January 7th. Have a wonderful
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:17.960]   holiday. Uh, Christmas, if you celebrated Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, uh, Winter Solstice, Summer Solstice,
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:23.640]   whatever the solstice is that you're celebrating. Uh, we hope you have a happy 2018 as well. And now,
[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:29.480]   a closing thought from O doctor Owen J. J stone.
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:36.920]   So piggybacking on the happy holiday and whichever holiday you celebrate, that sounds awesome. We
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:40.760]   were talking about Facebook and Twitter and being on the internet and how sometimes you can ruin
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:46.200]   things. But I'm telling you, call your aunt, call your uncle, call your friend, call that person,
[02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:50.360]   that single that doesn't have to be other or children, check in on them. It's the most
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:53.400]   wonderful time of the year, but this is the time of the year where people get really depressed and
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:58.200]   lonely. And your phone call can make the difference. You stop and buy, can make the difference. You
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:01.880]   send in a Christmas card or a holiday card can make the difference. If you want to make a
[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:05.640]   difference in my life, just reach out to them. Send a test message, make a phone call. Tell
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:10.600]   somebody you love them. Like I tell them, Kaleo, I love you. I love you. I love you. Oh, and
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:14.520]   to this season, we're ready for the new year. Do so the positive. Check in on somebody because
[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:19.560]   you never know they might need it. I love that. I can. Happy new year, doctor.
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:25.160]   We'll see you next time. Another twit is in the game. That's a beautiful set of it. Yeah.
[02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:26.920]   Right on.
[02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:28.040]   Do it.
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:33.560]   All right. Do it.
