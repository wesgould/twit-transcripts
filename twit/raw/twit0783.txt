[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.520]   Padre, Father Robert Ballis there,

[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.800]   Lexi will help me decide whether to buy a fold or not.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.720]   Father Robert's back from DEF CON
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.080]   and tell us how we can hack light bulbs, printers,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980]   satellites, and half of all the Android phones in existence.

[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.880]   It looks like President Trump did find a way

[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.760]   journalists.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.720]   It's always fun.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.640]   This is the one show where we rotate through a lot of different
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720]   hosts because I know so many people who do this for a living.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.760]   And I love them all.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.520]   And this is a great panel because it's two old "Twit" friends,
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.080]   Renee Ritchie, who is, of course, a regular on Mac
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.600]   Break Weekly, formerly Vi Moore.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   He still writes for iMore and other companies.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.200]   But Renee is now off on his own on YouTube.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.640]   He's a YouTube star, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.120]   Hi, Renee.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.640]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.120]   Hey, Leo.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.240]   It's good to spend Sunday with you.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.240]   This is a lot of fun.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.440]   Thank you.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.280]   Yeah, you never hear on a Sunday.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.840]   I try.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   I watch.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.120]   Aw.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.200]   You know who else is here?
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.040]   And we haven't seen him in many a moon.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.680]   Father Robert Ballisair, the digital Jesuit from the Society
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.200]   of Smoke Masks.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.440]   Hi, father Robert Padre.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.880]   Leo, it's good to see you.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.960]   My good visit.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.920]   Is that like, do the Swiss guard wear those?
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.320]   Is that the official Vatican hat here?
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.160]   Absolutely.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.680]   Absolutely.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   You have to wear one of those to see the both.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.840]   Actually, what do they do to protect the Pope?
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.680]   As long as you're wearing kind of a mask, it's more or less OK.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   One of the things that you have to remember is just to get near the Pope, it means someone's
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.880]   already made sure that you're not ill.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.360]   It's kind of a thing around here.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.480]   Do they have testing?
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   I'm sorry?
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   Do they have testing?
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   Rapid testing?
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.360]   No, but they do have, you know, they make sure that
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.080]   when you come near the Pope, you're wearing a mask.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.880]   They make sure that you micromanage.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   Oh my God.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.480]   You're standing next to him with the wrong kind of mask.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.640]   No, no, no.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.800]   See, my mask has been modified to put N95 filters inside the--
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.280]   So both in and out.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   It doesn't have an outline.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280]   Oh, thank God.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   Absolutely.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.120]   Yeah, because how old is Francis?
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.920]   He's not young.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.560]   I don't think I'm actually allowed to say.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   Really?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.720]   Someone gave me a list of things I can and cannot say.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   I'm pretty sure age was on that.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   What?
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   He's not that it's a secret.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   Not that it's a secret.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.720]   It's a big thing.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   I don't want this to be rumored.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   They allow me to say he's 83 years old, right?
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   Yes.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.720]   According to Wikipedia.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.720]   Okay.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.720]   So he's absolutely at a high risk category.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   I mean, I am too.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   I'm in my 60s.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.320]   So I think it's really important to protect him.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.480]   So it is, but I will say this, being a member of a security detail must be maddening because
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.880]   before COVID, he would regularly drink things that the crowd would give him when he would
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.680]   do his audiences on his day.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680]   No.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.920]   And that you could see the security people just going, oh, no.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.480]   And now it's I mean, he tells people to take precautions.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.640]   He tells people to be sensible, but he personally would rather embrace people and shake their
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.960]   hands than keep distance.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   You know, it's amazing.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.000]   And I remember there was a one incident where a woman actually grabbed him and pulled
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   on him.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.840]   And of course you look at that and you go, my God, but you know, he is a man of the people.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.360]   And he's a religious leader.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.880]   So it would only make sense that he would reach out and hold and touch people that's
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.240]   so important to them.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.960]   So I know I'm sure he knows what a risk it is, but I'm sure he also feels like, Hey,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.440]   it's part of the job.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   Right.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   Exactly.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   Jesus didn't say I'm not going to wash those feet.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.440]   They're disgusting.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.120]   It's I'm sure he thought it, but I'm sorry.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.760]   I don't want to be sacrilegious, but that's no, no, no, that's a man of God.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   Absolutely.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.200]   I mean, when every Easter he is at the prison, he washes feet, watching their feet.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.760]   When he goes out, the Pope Mobile does not have bulletproof glass.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   Oh, it doesn't have any of that.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.800]   What you still it used to do because there was an assassination attempt.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   Correct.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   Wow.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.720]   I love Francis more and more all the time.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   Everything I learned about him.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   He's just blown away.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.880]   He's just an amazing fellow.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.880]   And you're doing well.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.400]   You're healthy, even though you're you're in the former center and the epicenter of
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.840]   COVID-19 that that has been the strangest thing because everyone knows that it was bad
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.480]   here before it was bad anywhere else in the world.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   And so we are seeing the same patterns every other place in the world, except in some countries,
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.400]   there isn't that moment that we had in Italy where everyone collectively came together
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   and said, we're not.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   We're not going to take it yet.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   You know what?
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.560]   What aside your personal freedoms?
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   Let's take care of this.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.360]   And so now you're in good shape, right?
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Oh, we're great.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.960]   But for the grace of God, go we.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.120]   There you go.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.400]   Also, Lexi Savidus is here.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.280]   It's always wonderful to see Lexi.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.000]   She's a senior editor at CNET really does a lot of their video stuff and is just a charmer.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Hi Lexi.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's good to see you.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Hi, layer.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Good to be here.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Thanks for hanging me on the show.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Happy Sunday.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.240]   We're going to get our friends down under.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.160]   Well, I have been here for five years.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.920]   So technically, I mean, American and Australian.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.440]   Are you ever going to go back?
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.680]   I mean, you still have family back there.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   Are you ever going to go back?
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.680]   Well, okay.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680]   So here's the funny thing.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.080]   If you want to go back to Australia right now, there are very, very few flights from the
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.360]   US, understandably, but also you have to enter into a mandatory two-week quarantine, which
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.440]   you have to pay for yourself.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.880]   And so it's interesting seeing some of my friends who have gone back and also a range
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880]   of celebrities.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:18.040]   There have been very, veryable hotel quality standards, if you have to put it, I guess,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   nicely.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.440]   Some people have been put up in the places like the Intercontinental City, which has
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.280]   a beautiful view of the Opera House and Harvard Bridge.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.760]   Two weeks there, not a problem.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:36.520]   Other people have been put out 20 kilometers from the center of the city very far away
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.080]   from anything.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.320]   And they're staring at a brick wall for two weeks.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.520]   So the disparity there is quite interesting.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.560]   So yeah, if you want to go back at the moment, you really have to brace yourselves for, you
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.800]   think it's tough being in your own house for two weeks, but think about it in a hotel
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   room.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.720]   So it doesn't sound that appealing.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.960]   Now, I actually have a very important question for you, Lexi.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.960]   Sure.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.200]   Samsung had its event Thursday.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.760]   Jason Hall and I got up 7 a.m.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.760]   They announced the new...
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.440]   What does Samsung have against the West?
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.680]   Well, it was 11 p.m. in Korea.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.680]   So I don't...
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.680]   Yeah, it's true, right?
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.280]   They were staying up late.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.720]   Someone had to lose out.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.840]   Yeah, there was no win either way.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.480]   They announced the Samsung Galaxy Note.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.520]   I've owned every note since the very first note I love it, the Note 20 is the newest.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   That's funny.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.760]   They didn't mention specs.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.080]   They just didn't say what process they did so much.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.680]   Ram, they didn't say how much storage they didn't say anything except it comes in Mystic
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.160]   Bronze, the new color.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.200]   And it's 120 hertz refresh rate.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.840]   And they just assumed that you...
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.480]   And you know the rest.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480]   And then the...
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.120]   Which was weird to me.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.360]   They did announce a successor to the Galaxy Fold.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.320]   It's now the Z Fold for reasons no one understands because there's no Z involved.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.160]   Z Fold 5G something.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   Z Fold 5G 2.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   And Z Fold 5G, yeah.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   A lot of numbers.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.520]   And they did talk about specs there because I think they wanted to reassure people that
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.440]   it really is bendable glass, folks.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.520]   No, but they even showed Jerry Riggs everything trying to embrace it.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.200]   But they looked like Marques and if only they could do it with glass and they're like,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.720]   "Oh, Marques, we can."
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.200]   Like, but not when he said that.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   Right.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   Right.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.520]   Why would you try to text explain to Marques in a chronologically unacceptable way?
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.560]   They also announced a new watch for $400.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.200]   Earbuds that look surprisingly like bronze beans.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   They do.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   They are bronze beans.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   I've got them here.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   They look very...
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   Oh.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.640]   I have these and I actually have the mystic bronzes of the...
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.640]   Oh, that's his YC.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   That's why I go to Lexi.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   Because she knows.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.040]   Look at the camera bump on that.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.880]   It looks like a separate unit.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.640]   It is incredibly...
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   Sorry, I'm so excited.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.840]   I'm knocking my microphone over because it's so big.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   Look at that.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.800]   It's like a domino on top of the...
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   In the phone.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.440]   Look, it's a chunky big boy of a phone.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.440]   6.9 inches.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   But it doesn't feel like...
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.520]   Something like that is designed to be in a case, right?
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.200]   Because if you put that in a case, that bump is going to be fluffed against the edge
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.200]   of the case.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.120]   So, unfortunately enough, I have a case prepared this earlier.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.960]   So, look, the camera bump is significant.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.480]   So when you do have it lying flat on a surface, if you do want to do that...
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   You get the wibble wobble.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.760]   You get the wibble wobble.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.480]   So you put a case on it and then it does mitigate that somewhat.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   There is still a little bit...
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   Oh, it's still coming up.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   Not a case.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   You need a thicker case.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   Yeah, it's still coming up.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   It's a very thin case.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.960]   This is a very thin case, yeah, because I don't like my big chunky cases.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.440]   But yeah, if you put a thicker case on it, it should get rid of that issue altogether.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.680]   But then you cover up the nice looking phone.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.520]   You can get a clear case, of course.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.440]   But the whole point is that it just...
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.320]   It looks and feels pretty nice, at least from the outside.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.720]   So covering that up seems to change.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.600]   Now, the watch and the buds went on to order the next day.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.400]   And then September 1st, we can order the fold and the flip.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.840]   You don't have the fold yet, right?
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   So when I'm trying to decide...
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.160]   I wish I do.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.440]   I would usually buy a note.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.760]   I have every note.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   I don't.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   Are you upgrading?
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   I'm interested.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   I see no reason to.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   It's interesting being.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   What do you think?
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.240]   Well, it's interesting because I think if the pandemic didn't happen, and obviously Samsung
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:34.600]   designed this phone way before we knew anything like this was going to happen, $1,300 for a
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   phone...
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.520]   It's still a crazy amount of money, but it was probably more reasonable when there
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.240]   wasn't a pandemic going on.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.200]   Now we are in our in a completely different environment.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:50.240]   So $1,300, it really has to be a value proposition, but something that is going to last an incredibly
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.440]   long time.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.880]   And I think the announcement that we're going to get at least three generations of Android
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.880]   updates might help somewhat to sort of...
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   That's good.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.040]   Oh, $1,300, which is good.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.120]   It's got to be a three year phone at that price, at least.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   At least.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.280]   Although I don't think we still yet have clarification on whether that's three versions of Android
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.000]   or three generations of note phones.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.440]   So I think we need to get a little bit more clarification on what three generations mean.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.120]   One would hope it's three generations of Android at least.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.120]   That'd be three years, right?
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.480]   Because it's a yearly update.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   Right.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   At least.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.760]   We should hope that your $1,300 phone is at least good for three years.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   I would hope so too.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.760]   But yeah, I'm interested.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.440]   Like you're a note user.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   What are your thoughts?
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.240]   I'm really happy with the Note 10.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.200]   I don't see any reason to upgrade at all.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.000]   Is the camera light years better?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   The camera is...
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.440]   No, it's the same in a sensor.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.720]   So here's the thing about the camera.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.480]   When the S20 Ultra came out earlier in the year, it had the bells and whistles, the 100
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.600]   times space zoom, the 108 megapixel sensor.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.120]   And the problem with that camera was it was technically amazing.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.440]   But there were so many autofocus issues when it first was shipped to reviewers.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.760]   It was terrible.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.160]   I was taking photos like portraits.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.120]   Just a regular shot, not even in portrait mode.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.760]   And my subject would be completely out of focus.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.120]   And the background was nice and sharp.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.720]   And I was like, that's not my artistic intention there.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.520]   Because when you point and shoot, the focus was just getting all over the place.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.680]   Video in particularly was terrible in terms of focusing on the S20 Ultra, which has now
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.520]   been somewhat resolved.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.240]   But Samsung's obviously gone, oh, we have to fix that.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.400]   So it's now got a laser autofocus system.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.040]   I've been doing a little bit of testing preliminary stuff and it seems to be much, much better
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.680]   than the S20 Ultra.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.680]   So that's a good thing.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.440]   But in terms of like, is it a dramatic enough shift over the Note 10 and Note 10 plus?
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.920]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.240]   I still need to do lots more side by side tests to really kind of evaluate that.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:55.080]   Well, and then there's the fact that we are in a pandemic and spending 1000 for the regular
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:01.320]   and 1300 for the Ultra seems like an awful lot of money, especially now that the Pixel
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.240]   4a came out, which came out this week and is awesome.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   Everybody seems to love it.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   $1.50.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   And it's like nothing.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.240]   It's like $350.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.920]   But that seems like a very low price for a phone.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.240]   I got the just because I wanted to try it, the Motorola Edge because I've been a fan
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.520]   of Motorola since the Moto Xs and they've always offered kind of a very pure Android
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.280]   experience in a lesser expensive phone.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   This edge is a very nice phone.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.520]   There's a lot of choices.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.320]   There's of course the one plus phones that are much less expensive.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.720]   There's even the iPhone SE.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.680]   And I really wonder if the time is wrong for a thousand plus dollar phone.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   Absolutely.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.520]   I mean, look, I think the most impressive thing about that phone is the refresh.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.520]   That's the refresh.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.520]   The difference.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.760]   I didn't used to think it did, but I saw it at CES and it's beautiful.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.000]   But you've got things like the Asus ROG Phone 2, which will get you up in that area.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.160]   And it's a beautiful phone.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.720]   It's a huge, it's a ridiculous battery.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.360]   It's a 30 day battery life.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.880]   That's what the review unit that I used.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.800]   And it's incredibly fast and it's half the price.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.120]   So $1,300 for something that might be incrementally better.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.040]   I think if you had a note too, maybe, but definitely not if you've had a note from the
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   last two years.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.400]   Lexi, did the S20 sell well?
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.640]   My sense is it was not a big seller.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:29.000]   I don't think it did as well as previous generations of Galaxy phones.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   That's for sure.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.360]   It had so many issues straight off the bat and it did take a several months' worth of software
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.800]   updates, at least for the camera, which was arguably the biggest selling point of the S20
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   Ultra.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.280]   So considering that, it also had the 120Hz refresh rate.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.040]   It was a good phone, but it wasn't great.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.200]   And I think that was a real, those early reviews and those early issues with the firmware
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.400]   and the software updates that sort of kept trying to address it.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.640]   I think really did a lot of damage for, I think, users that were coming to the phone as the
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.160]   annual upgrade that they do.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.960]   Because I think the thing is with the note is that Samsung, it's interesting that the
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:16.280]   types of users that go for the note versus the S series, the note users are so incredibly
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.400]   loyal as leaders you are.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   I know you are.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.120]   You're so loyal and you're pretty much like, I'm not going to buy any other phone.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.280]   It's note or die sort of thing.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.720]   So it's going to have a lot of fans built in already that is going to come to this phone
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.160]   and go, I'm getting it no matter what.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.920]   In terms of attracting new users, though, that's going to be the interesting thing.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.760]   Because especially with the regular version of the Note 20 being $1,000 and having significantly
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.640]   less features that are worth $1,000, it's got that plastic back.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.960]   The Note 20 Ultra is that new Gorilla Glass that promises crazy drop durability.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.840]   I think it's like 6.6 feet or 2 meters if you somehow drop your phone from that hide
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.960]   or your kid throws it up in the sky and it shouldn't crack.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.160]   So you're paying for those cutting edge features.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.960]   But the regular Note 20 does miss out on a lot of those things.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.280]   And it's just going to be interesting, like who is going to buy the Note 20?
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.920]   I can see people buying the 20 Ultra.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   I'll get the Ultra.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   The regular Note 20.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   So I get it, I'll get the Ultra.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920]   Exactly.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.960]   So you can show me that Mystic Bronze again because that really seems to be the number
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   one selling point.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   Is it pretty?
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   It is.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   Do you have one too, Renee?
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.960]   It is very pretty.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.600]   No, but it's like the first color since Rose Gold that I thought it's going to reach
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.280]   for you in the morning like I get behind.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.280]   Kind of Rose Goldy, yeah.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   Yeah, it is kind of Rose Goldy.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.480]   And the good thing is about it, you know, as I know, I did a quick first look video with
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.240]   this, you know, it came out yesterday.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.320]   You know, the Note 10 plus layer, as I'm sure you know, it does look like a crime scene
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.840]   if you don't use it without a case.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.520]   You find that against fingerprint magnet, honestly, you dust it and you're getting like years
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.880]   worth of fingerprints on it.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.520]   The finish on this is the matte finish.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.400]   So at least it doesn't have that issue so far.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.960]   Yeah, the edge is the same way.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.200]   The edge is on the sort of different is on the different side now.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.400]   I'm going to be interested to see how you go with that.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   It looks the same though.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   Well, I'm a lefty.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   So that's how they do it in England.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   That's right.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.920]   You know who paid $1,300 for a phone.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   Who?
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   Okay.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.920]   So you got the tech people.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.680]   The tech people who absolutely need the tech and I get that.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.240]   But also the people who know that this would be a status symbol because you've got the
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.640]   latest, the greatest, the newest.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.640]   Yeah, but you're not going out.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.440]   If you're in quarantine, you're not going out.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.440]   I guess why is it?
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   Plus the stores are closed for most people.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.440]   You can.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.760]   I mean, that's why the sales of the S20 were lower.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.760]   So okay.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.920]   So really, my real question isn't that.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.680]   My real question is what if I got the fold instead?
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   That's what you should do.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.680]   That's, yes.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.920]   You need to wait.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.600]   We need to wait another month to find out details.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.840]   I still don't understand why it wasn't just like, let's just do a big event and then just
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.320]   announce it all rather than why tease it now.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   Why make us.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.800]   Well, it's only a few weeks off.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.640]   If I order September 1, I get it to 15 or the 15th.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.880]   But that's the baller move Leo.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   That's what you want to do.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   Look at that.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   So ballers, right?
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   It's $2,000 baller.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   Well, actually Leo.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.880]   Maybe.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.880]   I have a question for Lexi.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880]   I don't know.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   That's right.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.880]   Maybe.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.880]   Can you put the stylus in backwards?
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.880]   Don't do it.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   Don't do it Lexi.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   Don't do it.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.880]   I know.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.880]   I remember we had this discussion.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.880]   Yeah, I did it last time.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.880]   No, no, it's definitely being fixed.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.880]   Of course they would see.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   I know that's a little thing.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.160]   The whole Steve Jobs thing with, can you see Samsung doing the whole Steve Jobs thing
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.720]   with the fold saying, you know, you would pay $1,000 for a phone like this and you would
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.960]   pay $700 for a tablet like this.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.080]   And we could charge a premium on top of that.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   You're not going to.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.440]   We're going to price it at exactly that.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.280]   The two folded together.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.360]   It does have on the front a decent sized phone now.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360]   It's not.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   It's a 6.2 inches.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.440]   So it's a decent phone.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.640]   It opens up to seven plus inches.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.000]   But no one's played with it.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.280]   So your advice Lexi would be wait until somebody's broken it.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.280]   Right.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.000]   And yeah, well, I mean, you know, if there's someone for the job breaking things, I'm happy
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.080]   to volunteer as you view it to help make things.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.680]   Like 9,000 times on day one or two.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.840]   One of us will try.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:24.040]   We again, it's going to be really interesting to see if Samsung actually says anything about
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.360]   durability in terms of fold rating because that's the big reason why we tested the first
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.520]   generation of the fold because there was this big bold claim, 200,000 fold.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.600]   Like how can we not test that?
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.240]   And it held up, right?
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:45.520]   Just about, I mean, we did use a machine that was built by a company called Square Trade
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.680]   that was built specifically for testing this particular hinge mechanism.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   So it got close.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.680]   It got close.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   We'll see.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.080]   There's a new hinge in town.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:00.760]   In fact, that was stunned that Samsung spent so many minutes talking about the hundred
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.960]   parts in the hinge and the we went to that though.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   Don't do the interview.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   Do that.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.440]   Don't sit on in two chairs and talk for 20 minutes.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   Oh, that was dumb.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.440]   I know it was so dumb because there's, they weren't question, real questions.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.840]   You're questions from Samsung to Samsung.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   Yes.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.280]   But they said we were inspired by our vacuum cleaner.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.480]   That's why you know quarantine gotten to you.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.320]   Because you look at a vacuum cleaner and you go, "Inspirations."
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.680]   But I want that.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   They make fridges.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.960]   Use whatever you learned on fr-- use everything you've ever learned.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   Everything you know.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   Let's eat to drill rigs.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.960]   Everything you know to be better for.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.520]   I mean, even Dyson doesn't say that they're inspired by their vacuum cleaner.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.000]   They say their vacuum cleaner was inspired by a jet engine.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Right.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Right.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.600]   Well, I did reserve it because I don't know.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.240]   I just feel like is it, I guess the question is, are we, yeah, it's Mystic Bronze of course.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.400]   Or has the time come for folding phones?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.720]   I guess is the, is the real question, you know?
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   The other question.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.960]   I have pre-pandemic, yes.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.960]   Pre-pandemic, yes.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.200]   But we're in a pandemic.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.240]   It's probably two or three generations before Matt.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.600]   They're still in early adopter phase and they won't become mainstream for another two
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   or three years.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.360]   But a lot of us really love that early adopter phase.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.360]   We like being part of it.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   We feel like we're in on the experiment.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.520]   It's like, it's just us nerds for a couple of years.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.800]   It's an expensive experiment to be in on.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   I've had something just fitting on.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   Have you?
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   Have you?
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   They're nice.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.320]   Yeah, see, everybody who's had one says, you know, despite all the flaws, these are pretty
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.800]   nice to have.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.560]   They're places that kindle for 10 times a price.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.640]   It's thicker than heck.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.240]   I mean, that thing looks like it's, I mean, it looks like one of your Jaffas.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240]   What do you call them?
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   Jaffas.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   Jaffas.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.240]   Just put some grilled cheese.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   Maybe that's our test.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   It needs grilled cheese.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   How well it grills cheese.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.320]   If Joanna can do hot dogs, you can do grilled cheese.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.200]   I like this cream.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   It's the Jaffle phone.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.400]   Is the galaxy folded sandwich?
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.320]   That's what we should be figuring out.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.880]   Yes.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.120]   I like the idea of having a normal phone that, and it's roughly, the screen is roughly this
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.560]   size that you open it up and then you get this kind of tablet size thing.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.760]   And really, pretentiously in public, you just, oh, I'm opening my phone now.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760]   You know, just you got to do that whole--
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.280]   Too bad no one's around.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.280]   You're not in public.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.280]   On Zoom.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.280]   You can't put it on the Zoom call.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.640]   You go on Alex Lindsey's Zoom call and you open your phone.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   Oh, let me check.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.280]   Let me just say.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.280]   OK.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   OK.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:35.240]   So I just, yeah, you're not, you know, help at all.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.600]   I just feel like, is the time right, but it is early probably still.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   And you're right.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.720]   The prune thing would be to wait until you get one and break it.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   But wait, Leah.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.440]   I'll be the guinea pig and see how durable it is.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.640]   No, I mean, honestly, I don't want it to be durable.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.600]   I don't want to have to test its durability.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:03.360]   I want it to be realized to the extent that if this phone does end up costing $2,000 like
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.440]   we're predicting it will, it needs to be able to withstand the rough and tumble of
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.160]   everyday life, you know, whatever that is in quarantine.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.560]   Now it's, you know, sitting on the couch and opening it, just literally flipping it open
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.360]   and close because you have nothing else to do.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:23.160]   I did think I was briefly thought, oh, I should get the whole set.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.560]   Not the top round edition.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.800]   But I should get Mystic Bronze folding phone beans.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.600]   That's the only acceptable thing to do.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.680]   And watch.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.240]   And I have to say looking at the watch, I'm a kind of a fan.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.520]   I had the gear frontier.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.680]   I think that was the gear two.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.600]   I like the turning, rotating bezel is a very nice affordance.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.360]   I like it that it's round and it looks like the new one does almost as much as an Apple
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.120]   watch, which is, you know, I'm an Apple watch where it almost looks like I could trade in
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:26:00.400]   my iPhone, iPad, an Apple watch for a Z fold beans and galaxy watch.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.520]   It's certainly be a worthwhile thing to do for six months just to see how they compare.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.680]   I think that's what they want you to do.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.120]   I think the interesting that you bring up the comparison with the Apple watch because
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.000]   it's very obvious over the past, like watching the iteration of the galaxy wearable line,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.080]   particularly with the active two that came out last year.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.800]   That had those flagship features that we first saw on the Apple watch, you know, talking
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:29.200]   about ECG in particular, but it was a flagship feature on the watch, on the Apple watch that
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.440]   had FDA clearance when it first came out on the series four.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.680]   But then the galaxy watch active two was released saying, yes, it had ECG.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.760]   But it didn't get FDA clearance.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.760]   And a year later, we have just heard word that it did get FDA clearance on the watch
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.280]   three, which was just announced this week.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.000]   But then we don't know an actual rollout timeline of when to expect that in the US.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.520]   It's got clearance, which is a start.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.520]   But the fact that it was at least the earlier generation was announced.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.880]   And then we didn't get any indication on as a consumer, not just as someone who follows
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.520]   technology, you know, day in, day out as my job.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.600]   But as a consumer, if I bought that watch and I would go, great, it's got ECG, but oh,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   when am I going to get it?
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   Oh, maybe a couple months.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   It's fine.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.960]   A year later, certification is, you know, it's a big deal.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   It's a gamble.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   It's a big gamble.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.600]   It is a big gamble.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.800]   And if you get the Apple watch, any of you specifically looking for those heart features
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.400]   like ECG, you know, you're going to get it.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.200]   It's going to be fully functioning.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.360]   And the Samsung watch is not guaranteed.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.360]   We don't know.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.360]   We don't just don't have a timeline.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.440]   Blood pressure too is the same on the new watch.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.320]   We're talking about the promise of an ecosystem like this.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.800]   I mean, we like the idea of where it might be heading to have the watch, the phone, the
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.920]   tablet, the laptop all tied together in the same ecosystem, giving us real time, day
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.920]   to day data.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:52.880]   And yes, the FDA is moving on approving some of these applications, but we still haven't
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.200]   seen how you're actually going to create that environment, how you're actually going
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.080]   to create that ecosystem.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.880]   Do you actually have a plan for taking all that data and giving it back to me in some
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.240]   usable form?
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   Or is it really just going to be you're counting my steps and you're counting my heart and
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.480]   some health is much better than Google fit, I think.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.240]   It's a very good, it's a on the Android side.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.200]   It's the best health app out there.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.480]   I track my blood pressure.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   So having, if it were accurate, a good blood pressure sensor would be great for COVID being
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.000]   having an oximeter would be great.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.280]   I have a little oximeter that I bought in case anybody I know gets sick because that's
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:36.400]   one way that you know it's time to go to the hospital because you're not getting the air.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.880]   So I thought that was cool, but of course it won't work.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.080]   In fact, the only feature that is FDA approved is the ECG feature, which is the same thing
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.160]   I already have in the Apple Watch.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.480]   I just want the killer app.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.120]   I haven't yet seen the killer app for all the Apple Watch really.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.960]   It's a health watch and it's always on.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.160]   I just, I mean, I don't mind.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.160]   I like wearing a watch.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.800]   I like to know what time it is.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.640]   And I think this watch is also always on.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.640]   I can't get it.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.360]   I can't get it in mystic bronze, oddly enough, from the 45 millimeter size.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.880]   You can only get it in silver.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.880]   It's unbelievable.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   That's the whole thing.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.880]   The whole thing.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.880]   You only accept the ball.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.360]   Now tell me about the magic beans, Lexi.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:23.680]   The complaint that your reviewer and others had is that it doesn't do the noise reduction
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.320]   that it's supposed to do very well.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   Right.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.240]   So I mean, I've just taken these out of the box.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.520]   I've just got them pretty much this morning.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.960]   And you know, I think you don't have any experience.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   Oh, so you don't have any experience.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   I've used it.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   I've used them all day today.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   They're really pretty.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.280]   So can you put it in your ear so we can see how it fits?
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   Sure.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.280]   There's one size fits all right.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.280]   They have different tips.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.680]   So there's these different tips that will be able to be changed up the hall.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.400]   It's weird that the double size tip.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.400]   Is it comfortable?
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.400]   Let's see.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   I mean, I've been wearing it this morning.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.400]   Actually, that's quite pretty.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   It's fairly comfortable.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.480]   I do have very tiny ears though.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.360]   And the fact I was actually genuinely surprised that it did fit my ear.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   My wife's the same way.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.720]   I was actually scared that it was going to be too big for my ear.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   She hates earplugs.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.880]   Because it's one size fits all on the earpods.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.160]   And it hurts her ear because she has tiny hair.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160]   Right.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   So that looks pretty good.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   And it seals?
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   So here's the thing.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   It's an open design.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   Oh.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.880]   So that means it doesn't actually have the interchangeable tip that sits in your ear.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.080]   You're actually at your canal.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.440]   So it doesn't create the seal like the earpods.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440]   Oh.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.280]   So they just have that open design.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.480]   That is why I've just been listening with my noisy fridge on in the background.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.480]   Just to sort of see how it works with canceling the noise.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.520]   It is not as effective as the active noise cancellation from the AirPods Pro.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.520]   Oh, well.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   So.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.000]   And it's just because it's just the fact of the design, being an open design like this.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   You know, unless it's actually in physically inside your ear canal.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   That's a seal.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Much more difficult.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.160]   I have to say that is much more attractive than the AirPods Pro.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.280]   You just know that some YouTuber is going to buy a hundred pairs of those and make ear
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.280]   beans chilly.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.280]   That's just going to be the video.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.880]   It's a great idea.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.520]   And everything I'll do that.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.520]   All right.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.520]   Awesome.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.520]   They really do look like the bean in Chicago.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.520]   They totally do.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.920]   I was surprised they didn't call it the galaxy bean.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   The money is.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   I really should have.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.160]   That was the, I think the code name of people that were referencing it as that.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   That's interesting.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.160]   It's just a, you know, a missed marketing opportunity.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.160]   Very well.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.160]   And Lexi, they stay.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.720]   They like it when you shake, when you exercise, they don't want to come out.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.720]   I can.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   So it's funny.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.320]   I actually did a, so my colleague Vanessa Handoriana and myself, we, when we tested out the PowerBeads
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:47.080]   Pro and the original AirPods, when they came out, you know, it was probably like May last
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:52.640]   year, we actually did a full on head banging shake test with both of them in our ears.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.640]   It was quite fun.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.600]   What music were you listening to?
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   Oh, it was a little trash.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   Something.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   I don't know what it was.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.280]   Something that really, you know, it voked the need to head bang.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.240]   And we're actually surprised, I mean, obviously the PowerBeads stayed in better than the regular
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.200]   AirPods, but I think I'll be doing something similar with these guys.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.480]   But yes, to answer your question, they do stay in my ears.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.680]   They don't seem to be budging.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.960]   I haven't gone on a run with them yet though, because that's my next big test because the
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.240]   regular AirPods Pro for me, I just don't stay in my ears when I go on a run.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.800]   So I can't use them to work out.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.640]   So if I do a workout, I usually use like an over ear hooked design.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   Me too.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   Yep.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.640]   Yep.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   Same.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.240]   Because then you can't shake this loose.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.640]   Yeah, maybe I won't get the beans.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   Maybe I'll just get the watch and the fold.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   I don't know.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   There you go.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   Oh, come on, Leo.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   You know you want your beans.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.560]   I am actually getting really entertaining.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.560]   This is the real thing.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.560]   We know he's getting.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.560]   I really hate.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   Shut up.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.920]   I really hate earbuds.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.080]   I have yet to find any wireless earbuds that I think these are good.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.120]   In fact, one of the reasons I got the edges because it has a headphone jack.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.400]   I feel like that's going to be a little dis...
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.480]   Why when you put a headphone jack in the fold?
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.080]   You got all that real estate.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   One word, Leo.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   What?
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   Courage.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   Don't do this.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   Don't do this.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   Speak and encourage.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   Well, we'll get to that.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.520]   The Courage Man is gone.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.800]   He's gone.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.880]   I also want to talk about DEF CON.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.960]   Is it over?
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.600]   It will be over just a few hours after we're done here.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   Okay.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.680]   So, what if they held a hacker convention and nobody showed up?
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.960]   Well, we'll talk about that.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.520]   Father Robert's been covering that.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.120]   There's news all over the place.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.080]   Fortunately, we have excellent people to cover it for us.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.000]   Lexi Savitti's from CNET, my buddy Renee Ritchie.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.640]   From Renee Ritchie.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   Sorry.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.800]   Father Robert Ballisare, the digital Jesuit who's drinking.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   I caught him.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.240]   Got him mid-drink.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.160]   How's the grooming there in Vatican City?
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   Grooming.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.160]   What's that?
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:08.960]   I think a lot of people think now that we're in quarantine, we don't need to groom.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.800]   We don't need to know Stinking Grooming.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:18.040]   I'm here to tell you, even if you're quarantined by yourself, it's good for your self-esteem
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.520]   to take a little care of yourself.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.760]   I just got to love these.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.240]   These are the new Manscaped Shears.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.320]   The Shears 2.0.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.160]   This is the best, and actually Lexi, it's not just man.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.640]   A woman could use this too.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.080]   In fact, my wife keeps stealing mine.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.480]   She says, "The best nail glipper she's ever used."
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480]   Look at this.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   This is beautiful.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.840]   This is a grooming kit.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:45.520]   It fits very discreetly in your shaving kit or your pocket.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.000]   Actually, I can carry it in my pocket.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.480]   I carry it in my briefcase.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   Has a file.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.760]   It's got safety scissors.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:35:00.960]   It's got a very interesting design for a nail clipper that actually really, really is smart.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.840]   It really, really works.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.120]   It's just beautifully designed out of high quality steel.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:16.320]   Manscaped does everything right, including this is the Manscaped Perfect Package 3.0 plus
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.320]   peak hygiene plan.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.640]   This is another great Manscaped invention.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.600]   They just came out with their Moer 3.0.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:31.360]   The Lawn Moer is a waterproof cordless body trimmer.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:37.440]   These are ceramic blades spinning at 7,000 RPM, which does two things.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.640]   One, it means they cut rapidly easily without pulling or chafing, but it's also because
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.760]   it's such a high RPM.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   It's very quiet.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.400]   I'm putting it right next to the microphone so you can hear it.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.640]   You can Manscaped screely.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.480]   Sometimes, somebody comes over, you might want to run to the bathroom and just do a
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.120]   little once over.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.120]   You can do that.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.120]   It's got even a little light.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   You can do it with the lights out.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.480]   It's got a little pilot light.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.080]   Of course, a guide so you don't have to choose.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.240]   This is their third generation trimmer and they've gotten better and better and better.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.920]   I love it.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.960]   The Perfect Package Essentials Kit.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.440]   You'll get your upgrade every three months.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.600]   You'll get a new ceramic blade so it's always sharp.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.000]   It's always safe.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.240]   It's always satisfying.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.360]   It comes with a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.480]   You get a lovely luxury travel bag.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.960]   You get a pair of Manscaped's world famous anti-chafing boxer briefs.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.200]   No one wants to chafe.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:46.200]   You also get some of the delicious potions, the formulations like the crop preserver, the
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.000]   crop cleanser.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.280]   The crop reviver, I'll let you figure out what these are for.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.200]   Or you just go to Manscaped's and look on the website Manscaped.com/tritt.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.520]   And they even have a foot deodorant, which is nice.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.680]   Even if it's just for yourself, you'd like to stay fresh, clean, feel good about yourself.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:11.960]   If you're quarantining with a friend, doesn't the friend deserve a little extra attention
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.320]   to your grooming after all?
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   I think so.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.080]   This shears 2.0 nail grooming kit.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   I think it's so good.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.360]   Get those talons in tip top shape for summer.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.040]   Never worry about keeping the blade sharp on your lawnmower 3.0 Manscaped will send you
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.280]   replacement blade refills every three months when you get the perfect package 3.0 plus
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.840]   peak hygiene plan.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.520]   No commitment and cancel at any time.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.920]   They are raising awareness about testicular cancer.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.880]   It's the most common form of cancer among young men aged 15 to 35.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.760]   We've partnered with the Testicular Cancer Society to educate on the importance of early
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.600]   detection and self-screening.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.600]   Go to the website and learn more about that too.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.520]   Manscaped.com/tritt.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.040]   With Manscaped, everything you need to trim up and defuzz.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.360]   Summer is here.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:06.240]   And we've got a really awesome offer, 20% off and free shipping.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:14.320]   When you go to Manscaped.com/tritt.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.280]   Get 20% off plus free shipping.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.720]   This is a habit to start now.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.960]   Some day quarantine will be over and you'll be glad.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:28.720]   It even comes with the Manscaped Daily News, which I didn't understand and Mike has started
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.920]   to explain.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.320]   This is so you spread it on the ground so it makes it easy clean up.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:40.760]   They also have in here a kind of a guide for a variety of different escaping designs that
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.600]   you might wish to try.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:52.520]   There's the Get Lucky, the Royal Flower Power, a little thumbs up for Liked or a little Twitter
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   bird for social.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   I don't know.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.520]   That sounds a little difficult.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.280]   I'll just stick with the basics.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.880]   Anyway, love you Manscaped.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.840]   Great products, great quality.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.640]   And you know something I think we all need to do.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.640]   Pay attention to your grooming.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   It's easy.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.040]   You can just wear sweats every day and slob around the house, not shave.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.360]   But maybe it's for your own self-esteem and for the people around you, it's a good
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.440]   idea to take care of yourself a little bit.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.240]   Manscaped.com/tritt.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:28.160]   Thank you Manscaped for supporting this week in tech.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:35.680]   I think we'll be a good time now perhaps to talk about, boy, there's many places we
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.680]   could go.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   How about let's talk about DEF CON.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   How's that been?
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.040]   It used to be Robert.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:45.560]   We would prepare for this week because there'd be all we'd learn about all sorts of flaws
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:51.640]   and security problems and so forth in the talks at Black Hat and DEF CON.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:57.400]   I just tell you, what would happen to us is that the abstracts would come out and every
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.920]   contributing editor who was looking for a headline would write up the end of the world
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.560]   because XYZ exploit is coming without ever looking at the talk.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.440]   And then we would field panicked people for a week until the actual moment.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   And then they'd say, well, they really have to get to your system.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.520]   There actually was one, and I don't know if this was a Black Hat, but Checkpoint Software
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:25.920]   revealed Achilles, which is a nasty flaw in the Qualcomm Snapdragon.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.000]   I've got snacks on my mind after our Joffel conversation.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.800]   I snap dragon chip.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:38.400]   These vulnerabilities affect 40% of the Android market, including funds from Google, Samsung,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.120]   LG, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and more.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.280]   There are patches, thank God.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.080]   Was this a Black Hat revelation, Robert?
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.240]   That was actually a DEF CON.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.640]   I'm trying to bring up the slide deck.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.160]   One of the things that was different about DEF CON this year was the fact that they provided
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.920]   all of the talks ahead of time.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.680]   Nice, because they were all prerecorded.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.360]   And so you've got the slide decks, you've actually got the videos, you've got the write-ups,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.280]   the white papers.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.440]   That one was particularly interesting.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:10.000]   The talk was hard to follow because the researcher definitely wasn't English as a first language,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.920]   but as you go through, you realize what he's doing.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.160]   He was able to take complete control of an Android device, and you could do it in such
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.520]   a way that the person using the Android device wouldn't actually know that you got root control
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.880]   of his device.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.040]   That's terrible.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:34.560]   Now it says it's a Pwn to Own Qualcomm Compute DSP for fun and profit.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.040]   It's not the current crop of Snapdragon chips.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.120]   Right, it's an older chip.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:44.520]   So if you have a phone you bought in the last couple of years, you're okay.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.520]   There are patches, but this is the problem.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.960]   The older your phone, the less likely you're going to get patches.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.000]   And it's not necessarily even the older phones because you have to remember when you're
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.600]   talking about a billion plus devices that are sold every year, a lot of those are low
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.040]   cost devices.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.920]   And the low cost devices will use these older chips.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.920]   Yep.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.640]   It's 40% of the overall smartphone market.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.160]   So this is a lot of phones that need the patch that many of which will not get the patch.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.880]   There are six flaws, and they give you complete and absolute control of those phones.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.960]   How do you get it on there?
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.560]   Is it with malware, with a malicious app, for instance?
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.280]   Yeah, so there were a couple of ways that they were shown.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.400]   The one that I was looking at was actually not publicly available.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.280]   It was a demonstration that was shown to me.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.600]   Actually part of DevCon is the Discord.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:43.160]   They started up this Discord that has all of the people that would only meet throughout
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.160]   the conference.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.160]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.160]   And I mean, that's a good idea.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   Just like it would be if you were actually walking through.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   They have a wall of sheep Discord channel.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.800]   Yes, yes.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.280]   Although it's harder to do if you're not there.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   Actually on site.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   Spot the Fed on the Discord channel.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   It's not just a malicious install.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.880]   You can target it through a video stream.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.880]   You're kidding.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.880]   Correct.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.160]   Because it's a rendering engine on the chip.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.760]   Any incoming content.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.480]   Oh my God.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.800]   So this is a, this is a, this is one that you would clutch your pearls and say, oh no.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.240]   Look at those unforgiving.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.240]   And like I think every Silicon engineer has this sort of in the back of their nightmare
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   brain.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.120]   Because once you, well, when we saw that with a meltdown inspector, the flaws on the Intel
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.560]   chips, once it's in hardware, mitigation is not easy.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:39.080]   And more importantly, especially in the world of Android may not, there may no, no cavalry
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   will come.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:45.800]   Or the unpatchable, um, jailbreak we saw, we saw last year for the older iPhones too.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   Right.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.160]   That's actually, you're smart.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   That's what you target.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.000]   You target the newer chips, the newer phones because they will get patched.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.480]   You target the legacy devices because those manufacturers are known.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.560]   They're not going to put any money into developing that patch into something that's
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560]   releaseable.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.560]   Right.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.600]   What else should we be terrified of?
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   Everything.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.280]   Everything be afraid.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.120]   Be very afraid.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.360]   This was a, this was a, I don't want to say a low year.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:19.320]   I think it's, people are trying to figure out how best to push the research that they've
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:24.640]   been doing, uh, because online is, it's not, it's not, we haven't figured it out.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.240]   I, I'd love what they did with black hat.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.920]   I love what they're doing with Defcon.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:33.840]   Uh, but I, I, there was a sense of loss because when you're at the conference, you actually
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.360]   have a group of friends and you kind of help each other to point each other in the right
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   direction.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.800]   You don't have that with YouTube Twitch discord.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.280]   The other thing that I actually kind of enjoyed though was the, uh, there was an announcement
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.160]   at black hat, uh, about satellite hacking.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.680]   Now this sounds strange because we don't use satellite, but when you think about what
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:00.720]   satellites are actually used for of cruise ships, remote deployments for things like
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:08.160]   oil rigs and devices that are in remote locations, uh, they were able to show that with less
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.320]   than $300 worth of hardware, you could basically intercept any satellite communications and
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.640]   the vast majority of satellite communications are not encrypted.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   Right.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.480]   Um, and, and then I actually, I want to pick up some of this hardware and see what I can
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.120]   get here in the Vatican.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.600]   Does it include GPS?
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.080]   Oh, GPS is easy.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.600]   But this, this would be something like, oh, that's not a point of sale.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.040]   Oh, point of sale terminals.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.480]   Uh, this would be, uh, you know, you can pick up email conversations because they don't
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.400]   encrypt going up to a satellite and think about how the, how a satellite works.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.320]   When you're going up to a satellite, you do need to point in a specific direction in
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.600]   order to hit that satellite.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:52.000]   But when it's broadcasting, it's broadcasting and as large a swath as possible because it
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.720]   wants to hit the receiver, uh, as, as well as possible.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:03.560]   So your beam, your packets are really scattered anywhere where anyone with the right piece
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:08.800]   of equipment and that's basically just a digital signal, uh, receiver that has a DSP on it
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.880]   that you can reprogram can receive it and decode it.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:17.440]   Here's a talk I would have gone to because, uh, it's two researchers from 10 cent the Chinese
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:22.000]   company, evil printer, how to hack windows machines with printing protocol.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.240]   In this talk, we'll walk you through an incredibly fun bug we've discovered in printer spooler
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.480]   services.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:32.840]   It can be exploded both locally and remotely, escape sandbox, execute, it's arbitrary code
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.920]   and also elevates the system.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.160]   While Microsoft managed to develop the most restrictive sandbox for Microsoft Edge, this
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.600]   bug easily goes through it like it's a sieve.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.320]   But the good news is it's much easier to get a thumb drive and patch a printer than it is
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.400]   to get a thumb drive and patch a satellite.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.480]   That's a good point.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.040]   That's a good point.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.640]   But nobody patches printers.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   Oh man.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.080]   No, no, those HP printers are still vulnerable.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.320]   They're cheaper than the ink.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.680]   You just hide the new printer.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.840]   Well, and a lot of offices have these printers on the network sitting there.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.920]   And that's a real vulnerability.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.240]   So that one is today.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.560]   I guess I missed it.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   Oh well.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.240]   We'll hear about that tomorrow.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.240]   Evil printer.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   Great.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.440]   I'm sure Steve will cover some of these.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.400]   How about this one from Checkpoint also?
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.680]   Don't be silly.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.920]   It's only a light bulb.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.560]   This one was fun.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:34.840]   You have to remember that inside your smart bulbs, be it a cue or one of the knock-offs,
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.200]   it's not just something that's connected to the Bluetooth radio on your phone.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.440]   It's a mini server.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.400]   And it's a very poorly protected mini server.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.560]   And if someone can get that, it means they now have something in your network that they
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.120]   can pivot to elsewhere.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.000]   And I mean, people don't realize that.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   It's not a light bulb.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   It's a server.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.880]   It's a server that will never be patched.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:02.440]   So once somebody is in, they have visibility to everything that that bulb might be connected
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.440]   to.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.680]   This is kind of stunning.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:11.640]   As you go through these titles, Applied Cash Eviction through ATM exploitation.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:16.840]   Cash eviction is a euphemism for something we used to call jackpotting, making the ATM
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.840]   spit cash.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.760]   One-digit exfiltration.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:27.840]   Apparently, this is from the synopsis, "The high barrier to entry for even legal
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:33.360]   legally opening up an ATM has left a lot of attacks surface area unchecked through this
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.360]   talk.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.040]   We want to shed light in the state of ATM security and encourage the security community to continue
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.000]   to challenge ATM vendors to do better."
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.360]   Is apparently not so hard to get your ATM to jackpot or if you're using your card in
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.360]   your account.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.120]   If you want it, that's different.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:59.160]   There's engineering the Tesla battery for more power.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.200]   And on and on and on.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.560]   Don't do that, by the way.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:08.400]   If you actually own a Tesla, you can hack it, but it's very clear that you hack it again.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.920]   Elon will come to your house.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.720]   There's a, this is just fascinating.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.520]   All of the different things.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   But it's a shame.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.760]   It sounds like it's a little bit sad as well.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   It is.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   It is.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   But I mean, you were right.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.840]   When you and Renee were talking about this at the beginning that every year we get to
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   the sky is falling.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.840]   We get to this is the worst thing ever.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.440]   This is just how it works now.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.400]   We have to find the vulnerabilities.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.560]   And the nice thing about this is we will find the companies that are responsible enough
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.920]   to patch them.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.640]   Those are the ones that we're going to end up trusting.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.000]   Oh, that's a very good point.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Everyone will have flaws.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   That's how they respond to them that matters.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.720]   If anything, we would do the most good by just publicizing those companies.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.680]   Step forward and say, we'll fix it.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   Yep.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   And the ones that won't.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.600]   All right.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.600]   Defcon.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   Black hat.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:10.080]   I look forward to that sounds like one you really want to come to in person.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.720]   It's the, you, but he didn't have to secure his, his laptop and turn off Wi-Fi every year.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.520]   I mean, I don't think you bring a laptop.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.520]   Do you?
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.920]   Robert, I did it anyways.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.000]   I actually just a good thing.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   It's a year.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.240]   I do a clearing of all my devices.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   Oh, that's smart.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.960]   And I just did it again because it's kind of, you know, it's happened.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.080]   Are they going to mail out badges to people who couldn't make it?
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.080]   Oh, no.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.440]   So lost did a badge this year.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.080]   It's actually cassette tape.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.840]   And if you play it, it just sounds like it has music on it.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:44.080]   But if you run it through an oscilloscope and put left channel, right channel into XYZ
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.300]   and XY coordinates on that oscilloscope, it actually draws a pattern that becomes one
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.000]   of the clues for the mystery challenge.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   So they're doing it.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Oh, I love it.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.280]   It's, I mean, every single year when they do this thing, it just blows me away the imagination
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.840]   that lost and crew have.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.800]   I mean, it's one thing to solve a puzzle.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.140]   It's another thing to be the puzzle maker.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.860]   I love the puzzle makers.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.340]   Yes, I agree with you.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:13.060]   Did you see a bunch of YouTube accounts got hacked this week, Leo?
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.700]   No, what happened?
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:20.060]   One page tech, which is John Prosser's site, the guy who did all the Apple leaks and several
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.960]   others had their accounts hacked.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:26.820]   They went through two factor authentication using SIM swapping and various other means.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:31.700]   And they put all the, they either put all the videos into a playlist and private it or
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.460]   deleted them and started streaming Elon Musk Bitcoin scams.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.420]   And they were getting like 40,000, 60,000.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.020]   And YouTube wasn't taking them down at first.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.700]   And people kept complaining and reporting them finally.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:48.100]   And then the hackers got upset and deleted all the channels.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.260]   Is there a fix?
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.380]   YouTube says they're going to investigate and within, it was like Twitter was responded
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:56.860]   really well by comparison.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.940]   YouTube is going to investigate and within a few weeks, they should get their channels
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:00.940]   back.
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:01.940]   But those are their careers.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:02.940]   Yeah, that's a big deal.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:03.940]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.940]   Actually, Leo, there is a fix.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:11.780]   If you are an investor in cryptocurrency, no one wants to give you Bitcoin.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.780]   Yes.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.780]   Start with that.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.500]   Also don't have a phone number as a two factor mechanism.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.500]   Just don't do it.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.500]   Remove it.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.660]   Go into Google settings and remove it.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.700]   You mentioned the courage to remove headphone jacks.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:31.020]   The guy who uttered those words is well not gone, but he's moved upstairs.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:38.860]   Phil Schiller, a longtime guru, chief of Apple marketing has become an Apple fellow and
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:43.820]   is being replaced by somebody who's even been an Apple even longer, Greg Jazwiak, who will
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.820]   now be senior vice president of worldwide marketing.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.740]   We talked about this a little on Macbreak weekly, Renee.
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.860]   Do you know any more about it?
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.420]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.420]   I mean, Phil has a lot of, Phil's been at Apple for a very long time.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.420]   He's 60.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.420]   Yes.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.420]   He's an avid Laker photographer.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.420]   He loves, he's got a singer.
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.260]   He's got a bunch of, he had, I'm not be still does.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.460]   He's got a bunch of fancy cars.
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:11.500]   He's got a family, he loves his sports and he's going to keep control of the app store
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:16.380]   and of events, two things that he probably doesn't want to dump on was given on Jaz,
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:20.700]   sorry, given how high profile and how contentious they are right now.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.100]   And he has a couple other direct reports he's going to keep.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.820]   And then everything that has to do with product marketing at Apple, which is very different
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.820]   than other companies.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.260]   Like they're not sales people.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:34.140]   They're actually helping design, implement and spec out what's going to go in the new
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.260]   software, hardware releases, all of those things.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.220]   iPhones, Apple watches, Macs, all of it.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:43.740]   He's going to take on the senior vice president responsibilities for worldwide product marketing.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.780]   And we saw some of the people who worked for him, like Kyan Drantz got promoted to vice
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.580]   president of iPhone marketing.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:52.220]   And she was on stage the last two years for the app, for the iPhone event.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.420]   So obviously they've been, they've been building towards this for a while.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.860]   And this sounds like it's a transition out.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:03.860]   Like he'll keep some of these jobs for a little while as Jaz gets it all together and eventually
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.620]   Jaz would imagine to take it all.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.620]   He's super smart.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.620]   He's an engineering background.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.420]   He can explain silicon battery technology, battery chemistry to you.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.980]   Like they like to manage three layers deep, which is as someone who is geeky and nerdy
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:18.900]   and talking to them as opposed to talking to a sales marketing person, it's just nice
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.580]   to be so much more fun.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.460]   I'd far prefer to talk to Jaz.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.300]   I feel like he has done enough engineering.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.700]   He knows what he's talking about.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.540]   And he just, he just says,
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.580]   He's great for camera stuff.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.580]   Like they all have their expertise.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:31.580]   Right.
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.940]   You know, I could talk to Phil about the camera technology and computational technology.
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.940]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.940]   Yeah.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.940]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:44.500]   Well, Renee, this fellowship, it's basically, it's just a way to keep him from going some
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:45.660]   place else, right?
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.860]   Well, I don't think he would because like he's still bleed six colors, but it's sort of
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.500]   like Apple is so flat.
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.540]   Like they have very, very few senior vice presidents.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:53.980]   They have no presidents.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:57.900]   They have a couple of sea level executives and they have a bunch of directors, but they're
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:58.900]   not exposed.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.660]   Like there's no Apple hierarchy.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.140]   And it's just like we need we need Jaz to be the senior vice president.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.380]   We don't have another title for you.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.220]   We've got this Apple fellow thing since was.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.220]   Is that good?
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.220]   Yeah.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.220]   Okay.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:11.220]   That's good.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.220]   Yeah, I'll take it.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.220]   Whatever.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.340]   I wondered if it was like Silicon Valley, the TV show where he ends up on the roof having
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.580]   lunch with all the other people who were Apple fellows.
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.500]   It could be CMO, but it's just like it's not like it's not what he's doing anymore.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.500]   And I think he was.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.420]   It's a semi retirement and I understand.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.500]   He basically ran product at Apple for 20 years.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.500]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.500]   He's a long time.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.500]   He runs a lot of jobs.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.500]   He's a man.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.500]   Jaz is going to be doing that.
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:36.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:45.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:47.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.500]   He's going to be doing that.

[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   He's going to be doing that.

[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:49.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:57.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:00.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:05.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.500]   He's going to be doing that.
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.860]   The maddening thing to me, though, is here we are in 2020, and there are still articles
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.660]   being written like this that Tim has made Apple his own.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:21.940]   It's like the company is worth four times more than it was when Steve Jobs had it.
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.780]   They are profitable in every stage.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.900]   There are no loss leaders in this company.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:33.340]   They've gone through losing basically the entire channel team that made it profitable
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:39.660]   under Steve Jobs, and yet they've continued their rise in profitability every single quarter.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:44.860]   This company was his five years ago.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:52.940]   It is Tim Apple's company.
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.220]   He's entering a challenging era.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:59.700]   Of course, he was one of the four CEOs brought to Capitol Hill to testify before the House
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.540]   Committee on antitrust.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.140]   I thought he acquitted himself quite well.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.660]   He certainly impressed me by saying, "Look, we are not dominant in any category we're
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.660]   in.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.660]   We just try to do the best product.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.660]   That's what Zuckerberg said, too.
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:14.660]   That's hilarious.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.660]   Mark is.
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:16.660]   There's no question about that.
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:17.660]   But Tim was funny.
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:21.220]   There was that episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine where Gina managed to become invisible by dressing
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:25.020]   like Amy in beige tones.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.260]   That was like Tim was desaturated and very nondescript.
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.260]   They didn't ask him questions for half the thing.
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.260]   They forgot he was on the Zoom call.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.260]   You reviewed the new.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.260]   They did ship.
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.660]   We knew they would.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:40.820]   They said they would at WWDC.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.300]   Another Intel Macintosh.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.220]   In this case, an iMac.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:47.020]   You think this is the last Intel Macintosh?
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.620]   I think either the last or the second to last.
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.620]   I can see them.
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.780]   I think there's going to be a bunch of people who just won't accept Rev A boards.
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.780]   They will not take an Apple Silicon Mac first generation.
[00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.060]   They're going to wait and let people like me and probably you, Leo, probably everybody
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.060]   here.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.060]   I'm not the heroes.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.060]   Yes.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:07.380]   And they're going to want like either they run Windows in bootcamp or via VM or they
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:11.820]   have high end, you know, Brianna, style 3D rendering software that's barely supported
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:16.180]   on Intel Macs or for some reason they just need a good Intel Mac to go the next three
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.340]   four years.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.340]   And this one is great.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.980]   Core for core 10th gen Intel is not much better than 9th gen.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.700]   It's still 14 nanometer and we all know Intel's.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:28.740]   I'm just going to say Silicon drama is like beauty drama on YouTube when you dig into it.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.060]   It's just so much cross fighting and all this stuff going on.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.300]   But the AMD Radeon graphics chips are really good.
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:39.700]   And in my test renders, like I don't really care about synthetic benchmarks or entertaining,
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.900]   but to me it's time to finished work.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.020]   Like if I start something in Final Cut Pro when I can export it and upload it, that's
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.460]   the time that matters to me.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.580]   And this was like 30% faster than my 16 inch MacBook Pro, which is significant, especially
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.580]   on larger videos.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:01:00.020]   And the screen was already ridiculous with 5K and DC IP three color.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:04.580]   And now the nano texture where instead of just diffusing glare unilaterally, it kind
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:12.140]   of breaks it up so you don't you don't see any of the kind of loss of $500 upsell.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.380]   And we I've never liked Matt screens compared to glossy, but that's not what this means.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.380]   Me either.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.380]   Yeah, this is good.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.380]   And you like the best panel I've seen.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.380]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.980]   And I've said the camera, you know, Apple is not known for putting good cameras in their
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.980]   laptops.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:27.980]   They're terrible.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:28.980]   They're potatoes.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.500]   You said the camera on this is very good.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.860]   It's yeah, I'm using the Logitech Brio 4K right now and it is way better than this.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:40.740]   It's only 1080p, but the T2 chip inside the iMac, it's basically a co-processor.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.620]   I think just their contract with Intel means they can't call it that, but it's got the
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.940]   image signal processor from the iPhone 7 in it.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:51.660]   So it's doing all the white balance and a tonal mapping and everything that an iPhone
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.900]   7 camera did.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.140]   So I don't look like off color like this.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.020]   It looks really, really good, really crisp, really sharp.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:02.100]   It's got facial recognition, sorry, facial awareness for the focus.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.740]   So it's a really good camera and really good microphones this time too.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.380]   But same design.
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.380]   No one would know you.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.380]   It's the end of Intel.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:12.140]   I mean, like that's the thing to me.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.780]   This is the end of an Intel Mac.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.780]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:20.060]   This is the last Intel Mac ever or second to last.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.060]   What will they be?
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.020]   They're not going to do another Mac Pro.
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.460]   They're not going to do what they do in laptop.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.340]   Like I don't know if they would need to, but like the last thing I think some people
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.300]   waiting for was a 10th gen 16, 16 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.660]   There was a rumor that they would do that with the 10th gen Intel processors, but that
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.660]   most certainly would be less.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.260]   And most people wanted it for Wi-Fi 6 and I don't think Apple has any intent of doing
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.260]   Wi-Fi 6 on Intel.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:44.780]   So again, I think all the Macs are going to go to Wi-Fi 6 on Apple.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:48.540]   That's why I'm sure this is nice.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.260]   I don't need a new Mac right now.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.220]   I can suffer for another six months to a year.
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.420]   What if it was Mystic Bronze?
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.180]   Even in Mystic Bronze, although that is tempting.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.220]   What if it was shaped like a bean?
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:04.420]   I think I'm going to I'm going to it's not going to buy.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.420]   I'm not going to buy any.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.420]   No wait.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:13.680]   Intel stuff at all until I see Apple Silicon and see are you Lexi and a Mac person or a
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680]   Mac?
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680]   You seem like it would be.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.580]   Yeah, I'm no I'm running my work machine and this I'm actually streaming talking about
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.380]   this interesting Renee talk about webcam quality because that was the big thing that
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.080]   I was so interested in about the new iMac.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.860]   This webcam on the I'm running a 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.220]   What are you using for your camera now?
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.620]   Because it looks great.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.780]   It's a 15 inch MacBook Pro for 2016.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.780]   Oh, it's great.
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.060]   And it's really a good I'm glad.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.680]   Well, a little bit of lighting does definitely help this, but you know overall it's been a
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.680]   it's been an interesting you know watching the transition of MacBook over the past couple
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   years.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.780]   You know, I honestly I just the touch bar just drives me up the most.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.780]   Me too.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:54.580]   Yeah, I mean it's really hard to kind of get past that for many of my use cases.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:59.540]   I just like there's just no one application that it works seamlessly for.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:03.540]   You know, I know there's a bunch of different hacks and ways to get around it, but I just
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.580]   you know the touch bars still being one of those things.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.580]   It's just like it.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.580]   Oh, I just and the crappy keyboard.
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.920]   Please do you keep what's now been fixed, but this keyboard the one I'm using at the moment.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.680]   Yeah, I've actually got pretty lucky with the keyboard on this one.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.960]   I haven't had too many of the the stuck issues with the butterfly mechanism at all.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   So I've been very fortunate, but it's gone.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.240]   Lots of other things going on in different ways.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.880]   Yeah, I just don't like it.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:31.920]   Even if it doesn't break, I don't like it, but Lisa needs a new MacBook for for she works
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.440]   at home has a nice system at home.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.900]   But when she comes into the office once a week, she wants a MacBook, she's using the MacBook
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:44.120]   the 20, I guess 2019 MacBook Air.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:49.420]   And the nice thing about the MacBook Air Lexi is no touch bar and the new one has a nice
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.180]   keyboard.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:55.780]   But I'm not I would say wait for Apple Silicon for that, especially because that's where that
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.020]   may be one of the first Apple.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.140]   Unless the butterfly comes back, which is one of the rumors Leo, no, they're not going
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.380]   to bring the butterfly back as a rumor.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.940]   What?
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:04.940]   Who said that?
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:10.800]   A $700 12 inch MacBook with a butterfly keyboard.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.760]   Why would anybody but it's the fixed butterfly keyboard?
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   It's not fixed.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.760]   It sucks.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.800]   The fixed fix fix fix fix fix.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.200]   Still sucks.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   Still sucks.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.040]   All right.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:26.680]   I, you know, I'm on, I'm taking a break from buying stuff right now, except for maybe a
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.640]   sick M. Son Galaxy full to, but I missed the mistake.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:35.980]   No, but I think it's silly right now to buy an Intel Mac.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.440]   I just, if you can hold off, I would.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.880]   And that's unfortunately, Lisa probably can't hold off.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.880]   So she'll end up getting.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.160]   Well, again, unless you're one of those, like, unless you have to run Windows on bootcamp
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.520]   and that's a deal breaker for you.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.520]   Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.520]   Things.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520]   And right.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.280]   Let's take a little break and then I'm going to do a poll of you and to see how many of
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.720]   you are tick tockers.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:02.520]   I have in my mind, it seems like Father Robert and Lexi should be tick tockers and me and
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520]   Nick.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.520]   You don't see me flow jamming the news, Leo.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.320]   I could flow jam the news on the talk, but maybe I'm wrong.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.840]   Do you got the dance moves?
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.840]   Can you do the shuffle?
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.160]   It's got nano text.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.640]   And you I'm at me.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.960]   And by the way, tick tock's almost done.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.720]   Looks like less than a month left.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.040]   We'll talk about that.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040]   We'll see.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040]   I don't know.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040]   We'll see.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.040]   That's a big deal.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:32.120]   Our show today brought to you by Monday.com.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.960]   Monday.com is made for what we do.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.560]   Anybody who has a team.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.640]   Remember, remember in school when you would get, you know, you'd have to do a science project
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.400]   and you have to create a team and there'd always be a couple of people who wouldn't do
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.280]   anything and you'd call and say, what are you doing?
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.360]   Oh, I'm working hard on it.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.000]   You wouldn't really know.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.680]   And then it would come in your gray to be lousy because they were lazy.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.680]   And the problem with distributed teams, teams that are working from home is it's hard to
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.080]   keep track of them what they're up to.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.280]   That's why you need Monday.com.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.400]   If I had money.com in high school, I would have had it straight A's.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:11.200]   It's a team management platform that lets teams plan, manage and track work in a single
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.400]   centralized place.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.760]   So you always know who's doing what what their progress is.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.880]   It's a great way to collaborate without meetings.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.320]   So you work with a little team, five people, whether you work with a big team of 5000 Monday
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.200]   dot com.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.960]   It's the easiest way to keep everybody connected and on track.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.320]   So many people working from home now.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.640]   This is money.com is the project management platform that makes effective teamwork possible,
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.200]   even as we work from home.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.360]   I'll tell you a few things I really like about Monday dot com.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.360]   One, we didn't have to abandon the tools we already use.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.960]   We're big on slack here.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.080]   We use email a lot.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.920]   We also zoom a lot.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:54.680]   We use calendars, spreadsheets, most importantly, Google Docs.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.800]   I love it because it all goes into Monday dot com.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.320]   Though you don't, Monday dot com doesn't replace it.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.440]   It becomes the dashboard.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:06.640]   So you know all the work is in one place and you know what everybody's doing.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.040]   It makes it so much easier to track and manage without check in meetings.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.400]   You have a single point of truth.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.880]   So there's never any question.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.040]   And if you use data to make decisions, every boss does.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.120]   Isn't it nice to have all the data in one place so you're not guessing?
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.640]   You actually know what's going on?
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   I love the no code automations by the way.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.360]   Your workflow is on autopilot.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.680]   You'll get alerts, automatic status updates, project flows.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.480]   You'll keep your team on track, confident that doing the right thing, track progress,
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.400]   timelines, budgets, and look at it the way you want to look at it.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:50.640]   Whatever it is you know you're used to whether it's a Gantt chart or a Canban board or table,
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.400]   spreadsheet style table.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.680]   Whatever way you want to look at it, Monday dot com is so flexible.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.760]   We actually got some help from Eddie.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.880]   On request you can get an onboarding specialist who will help you.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.600]   Eddie even is at oh yeah for podcasting.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.000]   We've got these templates.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.200]   It was really simple.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.800]   He knew exactly what we needed.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.040]   It's just amazing.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.120]   It's a whole new way of working.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.080]   No wonder over a hundred thousand teams are already getting things done with Monday.com.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:22.680]   They've even changed how often they have to meet.

[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.200]   All without any effort.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.040]   That's what I like.

[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.480]   Hey we had a lot of fun this week.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.480]   I don't know.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.480]   Did the after hours make it into the promo?
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   Oh.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.640]   Who won the cooking competition yesterday?
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.640]   I didn't get to see it.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.280]   I'll have to watch it.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.880]   Looks like it was a lot of fun.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.840]   What John, what were the special ingredients?
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.080]   Do you know?
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.840]   Were they weird and wild?
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.840]   Chateau-minos.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840]   Loo won it.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.840]   Loo mm won it.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.840]   Soylent green.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.840]   I believe it was the mystery.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.840]   They didn't send them.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.840]   Soylent.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   It was canned chicken.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840]   Canned chicken.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.840]   A whole chicken in a can.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.920]   A whole wait a minute with the bones and everything.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.840]   The secret ingredient unfortunately didn't work out because it didn't get only for ants
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.440]   was it wrapped separately but everybody else got to see the crickets.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.600]   That was supposed to be the special secret ingredient.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600]   Crickets.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.920]   And the guest judges were fun and of course Micah T.D.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.560]   Micah hosting was a lot of fun.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:50.520]   And Loo mm from Twiatt, our new champion beating the incumbent Ant-Proit.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520]   So much fun.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.520]   Representing the enterprise side.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.680]   Yeah, he took over from you.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.960]   He's pretty good apparently.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.600]   Crunchy protein we call it.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.600]   Not crickets.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   That's much better.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.440]   You ate those with Kevin Rose.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.440]   I don't mind.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.440]   I love them.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.240]   I'll eat anything.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.240]   Let's take a look though.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:14.600]   We do have a video montage of some of the things that happened this week on Twiatt.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.440]   Previously on Twiatt.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.840]   My hat doesn't even fit on the screen.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.320]   We were talking about big bunny ears.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320]   Oh yeah.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.320]   Somebody else has fun.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.320]   Somebody else has fun.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.080]   Somebody has to have a shop Leo with Marj's hair please and thank you.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.640]   Twiatt news.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.640]   This is actually kind of interesting.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.240]   I might have to get one of these just to see.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   Finally in the users.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.520]   They really doubled down on this.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.320]   We're going to make a folding phone.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.640]   We're going to make it work.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.640]   Security now.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.840]   We don't know what ransom was finally paid.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.480]   But it seems more certain than ever that Garmin did pay up.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.520]   I understand how hard it is to remediate after a ransomware attack.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:59.560]   But if you have a backup of your data there'd be no reason to pay the ransom, right?
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.560]   Right.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:06.680]   So this is an implication that Garmin didn't have a copy of its data.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.840]   Tech News Weekly.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:13.400]   Can you talk just briefly about TikTok revealing its algorithms, how they work?
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.680]   No tech company ever wants to reveal its true algorithms because then there can be very
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.680]   easily gained.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.880]   But at the end of the day there are so many different things that could change in the
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:26.960]   code that I don't think this is the end all be all of transparency.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   Windows Weekly.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   It's Cortana Geddon.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:34.120]   Give it a different name like Cortana has now become Diana.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.320]   It's wait.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.520]   Obsolete to.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:42.680]   Or if you're on a Commodore 64, it's Twit, eight, one.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.000]   You've got is that a poke or a peak?
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.440]   So actually that's a Garmin apparently now worth it.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:59.840]   We're hearing paid $10 million to the ransomware authors to get their data back.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.400]   Ten.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.760]   Maybe you can answer this question.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.280]   Steve said, no, if you had a good offline backup, you shouldn't have to pay ransomware
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.400]   authors, right?
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:22.920]   It kind of depends if you are patient and you manage to infiltrate a network with ransomware,
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.520]   you wait.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:28.440]   You wait a month, you wait two months, you wait three months, you wait until every single
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.080]   backup has ransomware on it.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.240]   So you could do that.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:38.160]   In fact, I was reading the, I mentioned this before Bloomberg Business Week had a really
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:46.160]   good kind of minute by minute chronology of the North's Hydro ransomware attack of last
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.160]   year.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.720]   And that's exactly what happened.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:54.660]   They didn't pay a ransom, but the bad guys got into the network three months before they
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.920]   actually triggered the attack.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.680]   So that's why you do that.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.360]   You can see where the backups are stored.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.400]   You can make sure that you encrypt stuff gradually so that the backups become super
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.640]   anuated $10 million.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.360]   The other reason you might pay that is because everything's down.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.320]   And yeah, you might have backups, but the process of getting backup and running might
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.840]   might be worth $10 million to you.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:27.440]   It just seems such a bad policy to pay that because that just tells everybody, yep, it
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.720]   pays to ransom.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.360]   You're also giving them a war chest.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.440]   And now you pay a ransom.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.880]   You're letting them expand their operations.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.880]   Right.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.880]   Wow.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.280]   And as somebody that CJ is saying in the chat room, you're taking a big chance that
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:48.480]   these guys, you're going to pay them $10 million and they're going to give you anything.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.680]   They must have had some sort of way of validating that.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.800]   It must have been cheaper for them to pay as much as that was.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:01.600]   Yes, it absolutely would be cheaper because disrupting business operations for a company
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.320]   is worth more than $10 million.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.520]   Sure, if it's five weeks or four weeks.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.720]   But I mean, it really is the principle of the thing.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.280]   The thing is you're not alone.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.520]   You are setting a precedent for your entire industry.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.160]   And if everyone starts paying, the attacks get more sophisticated.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.600]   They get better funded.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.600]   They get better equipment.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.600]   They get more infrastructure.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.120]   They get a deeper hold.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.480]   So you are funding something that very likely will come around and hit you again.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.720]   Just depressing.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.240]   I hope I never have to deal with that.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.560]   I ask Russell or IT guy every time I see him.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.760]   We're okay, right?
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:47.200]   I mean, nowadays with employees off site, their email isn't being protected in the way
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.400]   it's protected locally.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.000]   There's just all sorts of issues that come up.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   Scary.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.200]   Let's see.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:59.800]   Let's talk about TikTok.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.760]   So I guessed that Robert, you must be a Tiktoker.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.800]   The only TikTok I know are the Intel upgrade cycles.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.560]   No, those are TikTok, TikTok, TikTok, Optimize Optimizer.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.160]   It's all a talk now.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.680]   I did see a TikTok priest.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.000]   So there are priests on TikTok.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   Yes, there are.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.360]   They remind me, if some of them remind me of you, they're very smart, fun, interesting.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.240]   It's kind of cool to see these.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:37.280]   Now some of them are just dressed up as priests, okay, but it's kind of cool to see these actual
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.880]   priests on TikTok.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:44.040]   I have done consultations for priests who have asked me what kind of equipment, how they
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.880]   should do their productions.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.440]   And I'm more than willing to help.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.680]   I don't really want to get into that.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.680]   I don't want to do that.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.600]   No, I won't do that.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.400]   This is a Polish priest who is, that's some holy rolling.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.240]   Pretty good dancer.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.760]   He's like, oops.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:06.240]   I feel like the church doesn't mind this so much because it shows that priests are people
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.440]   and they are...
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.640]   You really aren't, Leo.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   You really aren't.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   Okay.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.640]   No.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.640]   No.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   No.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.280]   I get it.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:23.080]   And it actually, this is hit a lot more than any other social media activity.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.960]   Is this a real priest's wait a minute.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.400]   Father Tim, he's terrible.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   Good morning.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400]   I think he is.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:35.720]   I think it looks although, I mean, in the United States, a priest wearing a casket is
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.720]   not normal.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.720]   Not very common.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.720]   Especially on Lake Michigan.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.720]   Is that a crocodile?
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.560]   Is that a crocodile?
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.840]   There was a father, Tim Podcaster for a long time who was great.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.440]   I really enjoyed him.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.200]   Here's the papal challenge.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.040]   See how long you keep a soccer ball?
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.440]   No, that's a whole toilet paper.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440]   Oh.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.080]   That's the papal.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.080]   I get it.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.080]   Oh, I get it.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:10.360]   It's a papro, V-A-P-E-L.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.920]   Lexi, are you a talker?
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.720]   I'm a talk lurker.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.120]   A lurker.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.200]   I can't dance or sing or lip sync to save my life.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:28.200]   So those instant ways to become TikTok famous, I don't think, they just don't work for me.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.280]   I like observing and I love the algorithm.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.160]   It's kind of like why Snapchat was so appealing back when it first came out.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.400]   Just like it opened straight to the camera on Snapchat.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.800]   It opens straight to stuff you actually want to watch on TikTok.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.760]   So you can now is...
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.760]   That's my problem.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:50.160]   My only problem with it, honestly, is it's a two-hour time sync.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.160]   You can't stop TikToking.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.160]   What else is...
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.040]   What are we doing with our time in quarantine?
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.480]   Look, I don't even know what time is.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.680]   I don't know what day it is.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.400]   I feel a little guilty, but not that bad.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.400]   It's funny.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.560]   You know what TikTok is?
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.560]   What?
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.160]   TikTok is what creepy wanted to be.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.680]   Well, I've said this before and I think this is a really good example.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:17.040]   So, and this is why I'm kind of irritated with a White House because I think that they're
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.640]   picking the...
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.640]   Here we are.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.320]   We're talking about big tech.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:26.520]   We brought Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about he's too big.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.120]   You're too dominant.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.720]   Here's this little upstart social media network that is now the most popular in the world
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.800]   beating Instagram with the kids anyway, certainly beating Snapchat.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.880]   And now you want to put it out of business because it's Chinese.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.360]   It's kind of annoying to me.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.880]   I think this is a...first of all, a couple of things I really like about it is it's a new
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:53.000]   medium and the kids who are using it, you would never see them on Quibi.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.920]   The Quibi model is you raise $2 billion.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:04.400]   You hire Hollywood producers, shooters, camera operators, talent.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:09.040]   You produce very expensive programming in seven-minute chunks.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   Next step, profit.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   Nobody watches.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.920]   Nobody watched it because the problem with the Hollywood model is all of the expenses
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:20.560]   up front, all the effort is up front and you hope that something will become a hit.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:25.000]   Most movies are flops, but if one in ten is a hit, it makes so much money, it pays for
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.960]   all the rest of profit.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.320]   That was the Quibi model.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.280]   TikTok model is much more like the YouTube model.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.360]   You create something attractive that people like to use to create, a tool that people
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.120]   like to make stuff with.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.960]   You create a platform where they're reinforced for their work that people like them and share
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.280]   it and they get the feedback.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.800]   They like not money, just the positive strokes.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.160]   People will start creating millions of videos and then you use that algorithm to surface
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.920]   the stuff people want.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.920]   That's the system.
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.920]   That's the exact opposite of the Hollywood system.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.960]   It's like YouTube and Facebook on Hulk's here.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:06.520]   Their algorithm is so good at showing you exactly what you want to watch over and over
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.960]   and over again.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:13.040]   It's like Instagram cloning it into real stories.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.320]   It doesn't work because they're just doing the dancing.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.000]   They're not showing you the dances you want to see.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.240]   They don't have the algorithm that TikTok figured out.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.800]   I think that's part of it.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.440]   One of the ways that got people scared because we've seen Facebook misuse algorithms to say,
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.920]   "We're going to make you sad now or we're going to make you happy now."
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:36.400]   They're terrified that that kind of algorithm will be used to further agendas that are outside
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   of the internet.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:42.560]   What the president has implied is that TikTok spying on you.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.280]   The answer is yes.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.280]   Of course they are.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.680]   They're all spying on you.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.680]   That's the point.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.960]   That's how they make their money.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:57.080]   In fact, the biggest spy of information would be Palantir, which is paid by the government.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.000]   The question is, "Oh, they're spying on you.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.320]   Therefore, they're bad.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.760]   They're spying on you for somebody else and we don't know who they're spying on you for."
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:09.360]   The fear is because they're a Chinese-owned company that maybe, but I don't honestly think,
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.680]   what's the Chinese government going to learn from spying on me?
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.880]   But you said something, Renee, that actually could be a problem.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.160]   You see the other way around.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.440]   It's like all of a sudden your feet is telling you Hong Kong protesters are bad.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.680]   It's that sort of opinion.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:30.480]   We've seen this with Facebook and YouTube and how they radicalize and red pill and turn
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.560]   people into extremists.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:37.400]   I will YouTube for one Megalodon video to find out about the historical animal and I will
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.520]   get deep-seize conspiracy theories for a month on YouTube.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:47.720]   Same on Facebook, people start looking for things and they become increasingly radicalized.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:53.000]   The fear is that this will be used by a nation state other than a US conglomerate that has
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.960]   a reckless regard for the privacy and mental health of its user base.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:01.040]   There was actually a black-hat presentation on this, right, Robert?
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.440]   Renee D'Arresta.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.440]   What she did, she's been doing analysis of this for a long time.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.200]   She's at Stanford at their Internet Center.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:18.120]   She said they're starting to see that state-sponsored actors are fine-tuning the process of driving
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.640]   social media to influence.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:25.120]   It's no longer just, "Oh, we want to ruin a reputation or we want to sow discord."
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:30.280]   That's sort of Generation 1 or maybe even Generation 2 of using the Internet to do this.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:37.120]   This is driving particular sentiments and they're getting so good at it.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.520]   The irony is the most impossible to detect.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:44.800]   The state actors that are doing this from Russia and mostly from Russia are not using
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.200]   TikTok to do it.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:50.200]   They're using American companies like Facebook and Twitter.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.920]   Yesterday they said a lot of the anti-masks that were not a lot of it, but some of the
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:57.200]   anti-masks stuff was coming through Russian bots, which of course.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:02.360]   There is a potential threat from TikTok, although I've never seen any thing on TikTok
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:09.680]   that has any social, any serious, it's mostly dance moves and jokes.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.120]   I suppose TikTok could be used that way.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:16.360]   Is there evidence that it has been used that way about the Chinese government?
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:21.000]   You can use it to find which way the zeitgeist is moving.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.040]   What TikTok need to own it to do that?
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:29.040]   You don't.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.160]   You know any more than Fancy Bear needs to own Twitter or Facebook to use it.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.200]   They could just as easily use TikTok if they could work the algorithm.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.040]   I think TikTok is actually a tougher for them to work.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:44.880]   The theory works is that you have a very fine granular scope as to what people are paying
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.040]   attention to each and every single minute.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:52.000]   If you can tie into that, it's not just a matter of knowing where to push.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.560]   It's knowing when to push.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:58.360]   TikTok gives you the ability to know when to push.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.920]   I like you, Lexi.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.080]   I'm a TikTok lurker.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.360]   I love watching TikTok.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:09.360]   I'm actually, even though my business is making videos, just like yours, I am intimidated.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.560]   I don't feel like I have anything to add.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.880]   Are you a K-pop Stan Lio?
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   Are you on there?
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.280]   I wish I could dance like that.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.280]   I wish I could do something.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.840]   I don't feel like any TikTok wants to see me.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.840]   How about you, Renee?
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.880]   I ignored it for too long and then I couldn't get my username.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880]   I have everywhere else.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.280]   Renee Richie, I don't even remember.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.840]   Somebody's got Renee Richie.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.880]   No, I found out about it on Macbreak Weekly from Alex Lindsey when he was expirying Wylie
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.640]   and Curly the Millio had so much appeal and how he was doing green screen.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.960]   He was bringing ILM to a TikTok fight, which is hilarious to me.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:50.000]   I started looking at it and there are some real, it is an incredibly engaging platform.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.120]   People love it because your acceleration to popularity on TikTok is way faster than
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.880]   anything we've ever seen before, like way faster than YouTube.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.880]   You can go from zero to a million followers.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.120]   If you have the talent and skill to pull off engaging videos, TikTok will find you an
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.080]   audience fast.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.120]   The president has wanted to ban a TikTok.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:16.200]   He couldn't figure out a way to do it, but I think he might have found a way with executive
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.200]   order.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:23.760]   He could prohibit Americans from having any transactions with the parent company, ByteDance,
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.160]   starting September 20th.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:30.360]   That means TikTok can't pay influencers.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.680]   Advertisers can't buy ads.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:37.840]   TikTok's response to that is we will help influencers move to another platform.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:43.680]   We will make sure that everybody we owe money to gets paid before September 20th.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:50.080]   The plan B, and it's very unclear because the president goes back and forth on this, is
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:55.840]   to have some American company acquire at least the American operations of TikTok.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:00.440]   Microsoft has been negotiating to buy the Australian American Canadian and I think UK
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.120]   rights to TikTok.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.120]   They have until the 15th.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.840]   Well, he's quietly rewrite it and dot net and that would be effectively killing it.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.480]   It's been used to clever point.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.480]   Give it to Michael.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.480]   Bill Gates has said it's a poison pill.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.480]   He did say that.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.480]   I saw that interview.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.800]   Really good interview with Bill Gates, by the way.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.160]   Highly recommend that.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.160]   Where was that?
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.040]   I just saw it right at this morning.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.480]   It was with Stephen Levy.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.480]   Was it wired?
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.480]   Stephen.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.600]   Do you all have to remember that the way that the executive order was written?
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.880]   He knows he can't block it and he doesn't even have the knowledge to understand how that
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.480]   would even be possible.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.760]   So he's stopping financial transactions.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.480]   The problem is the companies that he's trying to stop the financial transactions with own
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.320]   like 60% of the gaming landscape.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.320]   Or they have interest in 60% of the game.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.080]   We chat and 10 cent.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:50.840]   And the other problem is he had to declare a national emergency.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.880]   So apparently TikTok is now a national emergency.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:54.880]   Oh, actually, yeah.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.520]   Not COVID-19.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.720]   Not Russian efforts to influence the election.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:05.160]   Sometimes I feel like maybe this is, I feel like there's a larger agenda from the White
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.160]   House.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160]   It has to do with a trade war.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.240]   It has to do with pay no attention to Russia.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.360]   I'm not celebrating the Chinese government.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.360]   They're repressive.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:20.840]   What they've done, the Uighurs is shocking and disappointing and horrible.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:26.340]   And there was some evidence that maybe TikTok was doing something to keep black creators
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.720]   down or to keep overweight people.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.880]   Although I see plenty of overweight people on TikTok now.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.000]   So they clearly fixed that algorithm.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.360]   I just don't see TikTok as that big of a threat.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:43.880]   And I'm a little disappointed for the creators who found this incredible medium to make something
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.480]   really amazing.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.800]   And I often even feel like maybe the president doesn't like the fact that he's being made
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:57.040]   fun of on TikTok and that TikTokers registered for his Tulsa campaign rally didn't show up.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.120]   And it seems to be personal.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.920]   He says, but it totally makes sense because, I mean, if you ban TikTok, those people will
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.280]   totally not go anywhere else.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.560]   I mean, they'll just stop.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:11.480]   I remember with Ryan Twitter closed vine and that became a lot of the huge YouTubers now.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.640]   Well, by the way, that's the other chilling story that Twitter is trying to get TikTok,
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.320]   which that's the best thing to do if you want to kill TikTok.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.680]   Just give it to Twitter.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.680]   I don't.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.960]   Yeah, good thing Twitter never had anything like.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:32.360]   Actually Twitter is not doesn't have nearly the money that it would take to buy TikTok.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:37.680]   TikTok is going to be well over $30 billion if it is sold to Microsoft.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.880]   And the whole thing is interesting.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.920]   You could ban TikTok the same way that the Great Firewall bans Twitter and Facebook,
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.640]   just by preventing the app from being downloaded and firewalling off the servers.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:52.680]   But how do you separate it out so that I'm on Canadian and American TikTok.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.160]   You're on UK TikTok.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.960]   Can we not see each other anymore?
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:58.040]   Can we put the data stored somewhere else?
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.040]   It's just time clear.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.400]   So many questions that people who don't have no idea how software and services work seem
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:07.360]   to want to manipulate people that accuse me of saying, "Oh, you're soft on China."
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.840]   You're giving it past and apparently there were big fights in the White House over that
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.840]   as well.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.720]   But I just don't see TikTok as a threat.
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:17.760]   There are some serious threats that are being completely ignored from Russia on Facebook
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:23.800]   and Twitter that are just being downplayed and ignored while TikTok seems to be the poster
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.000]   child for problems.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.680]   And incidentally, it won't stop with TikTok.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:32.360]   This is really about Chinese products and Chinese apps.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.520]   And that is really challenging.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:36.720]   It's about privacy.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:42.560]   If you are really concerned about TikTok being able to track what US citizens are doing,
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.920]   it's not just TikTok.
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:44.920]   It's Facebook.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:45.920]   It's Twitter.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:46.920]   It's Google.
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.520]   It's everybody who has a cloud presence.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.480]   Well, similarly, if you're worried about that, similarly, if you're worried about how
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:57.280]   it could be used by foreign actors to influence us, you're not stopping it on Facebook and
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.280]   Twitter.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.720]   It's not the ownership of the company that matters.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.720]   Anybody can use TikTok, Facebook or Twitter to do that.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.000]   You just have to take the algorithm.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.440]   But that's that whole data repatriation thing we were talking about a while ago when countries
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:15.280]   like China and France started saying they wanted the data for their citizens stored on
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.720]   servers that were located within those countries.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:22.200]   I think Australia and a couple other countries because ironically, they didn't trust necessarily
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:26.600]   Chinese or US servers because they didn't feel like they had their best, you know, everything
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.160]   like Faisal warrants and things like that.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:31.040]   They didn't feel like they had the best interest of their citizens in mind.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.240]   And I think we're still going to see an upswell of data repatriation laws globally.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.320]   But it goes beyond that.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:42.920]   And that is a country can ask for the data on servers that are contained on servers in
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:45.720]   their country in their territory.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:50.280]   TikTok stores American data in America and backs it up in Singapore.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.280]   Correct.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.280]   According to TikTok.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.280]   Yep.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.280]   That's all right.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.280]   And maybe Canadian data in the US.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.160]   They would have to have an entire data center in every single country.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:05.720]   And I also worry that at some point you're going to see the Chinese lose their patience.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:09.160]   And there are quite a few American companies that do a lot of business in China, including
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.320]   Apple.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:16.760]   Apple is hard because like the hardware is such an important part of the economy of
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:19.160]   southern China like they couldn't turn that off.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.960]   Apple hardware would devastate San Jen and all the companies and all the workers there.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.880]   And Apple services could be an easy target.
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:32.720]   And it is interesting because right now some people see a disparity like China will not
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:35.320]   accept anyone saying anything about Chinese policy.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:40.360]   Like you saw when the NBA commented about Hong Kong or other people, they were furious.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.640]   But it goes one way.
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:46.800]   They don't mind commenting on at all on how the US or Canada or other countries.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.440]   And the same way they get upset if Chinese services like Huawei or something are not
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:55.960]   allowed access into Western markets, but they have no qualms about banning Twitter
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:59.120]   and Facebook and all the services in China.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:02.880]   And I think it's, I forget who said it might have been Ben Thompson because he lives in
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.680]   Taiwan is really smart about this.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:09.400]   That we insist on viewing China from an American point of view when we very seldom take the
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.240]   opportunity to look at America from a Chinese point of view.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.240]   Right.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.240]   Well, this is where it's heading.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.280]   In five years, this is the fragmentation of the Internet.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:20.800]   This is what we've been talking about a tweet for the last decade, which is you've got
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.160]   the Great Firewall of China.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:23.160]   They're doing that in Russia.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.240]   They're doing that in Saudi Arabia.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.680]   They're doing that in Venezuela.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:29.600]   We now have a administration that wants to do the same thing in the United States.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.360]   Do we not want to have a...
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.720]   I don't think it's right.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.720]   I think we condemn those countries for doing that.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:38.320]   It's bad for them and it's bad for the world.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:42.320]   Do we want to have a Great Firewall of America?
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.320]   That's where we're headed.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.760]   Oh, I mean, we don't.
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.760]   But there's like the thing about Twitter, it's so interesting.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:53.040]   Social Never in general is that volume is mistaken for amount of people.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.800]   They'll say, "If you say this, half your viewers are going to be upset."
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.080]   And really, it's like half of 1%.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.960]   They're just incredibly loud.
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:04.800]   I think that's what's happening here is that there's a sentiment of quid pro quo.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.680]   If you hit us, we hit you back.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:09.920]   That's very different than when we're like, "Oh, we'll just send Beatles tapes and blue
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:10.920]   jeans to Russia.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.920]   It'll be fine.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:12.920]   We don't have to act like Russia.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.680]   We have to act like the West and Russia will see it's better to be this way."
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:20.880]   And that trend has been curtailed significantly over the last few years.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:26.680]   State Department is offering about a $10 million for information that helps it catch state
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:35.360]   hackers trying to meddle in the 2020 election, the Rewards for Justice program.
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.920]   We know that Russia has tried to get involved.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:45.560]   I thought it was kind of interesting that they talked about Russia, which is actually
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.880]   doing things.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.040]   And then they mentioned China and other countries who have an interest in Iran, who have an
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:58.480]   interest in winning, who wins, but aren't necessarily doing anything as if it's related.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.480]   The same thing.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:04.080]   And I will see.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.160]   This is the third reward offered by the RFJ for foreign hackers this year.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:13.880]   They had a $5 million reward in April for information on North Korean government hackers.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:19.400]   They offered two bounties of a million dollars a piece on two specific Ukrainian hackers.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:24.240]   I'm not sure if these bounties have accomplished anything, but they're out there.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:25.640]   So get to work, kids.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.560]   You could make some money.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.800]   The State Department asked us for help in identifying those who might be inviting or
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:37.840]   helping foreign powers interfere in our election as sort of like, "Oh, Jason, it's an offering
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.240]   a bounty for the real killers of Nicole."
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.240]   Okay.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.240]   Wow.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.520]   Intel.
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:53.100]   God, that just trouble kind of one-
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.200]   Contromonial.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.200]   Just nonstop drama.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:58.040]   Now it turns out they were infiltrated.
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:04.800]   There's a 20 gigabyte breach of internal documents marked confidential, restricted secrets.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.320]   There's source code.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:15.280]   There's plans, intellectual property, chipset designs, technical specs.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.280]   Were they breached?
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:19.480]   I mean, it goes back to 2016.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:24.560]   Intel has confirmed that this is in fact their stuff.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:27.000]   They're investigating.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.800]   How bad is this for Intel?
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.960]   Or is it just embarrassing?
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.360]   Both?
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.960]   We don't really know.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.240]   Yeah, that's proprietary.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240]   That's proprietary.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.240]   Can't tell you.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.720]   You don't want anyone to have that.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.880]   But unfortunately, this is kind of the least of their worries right now.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.320]   It's like, it's nothing we don't already know.
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.320]   They're worried about exploits.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.800]   Like they're worried about another meltdown being revealed by people sifting through the
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:52.800]   documents.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.640]   I'm sure if there is anything in there, they'll...
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.880]   I mean, you've got AMD with the Ryzen architecture just kicking their butt up and down with the
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   performance index.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.840]   You've got Apple moving away from Intel.
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:09.600]   You've got NVIDIA looking at buying its own, becoming its own processor manufacturers so
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.520]   that they could be the provider for enterprise and for data centers.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.760]   Intel, they're in trouble.
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.000]   They're in serious trouble.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.080]   Intel downplayed it saying the information comes from the Intel Resource and Design Center,
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:25.440]   which hosts information for use by our partners who have registered for access.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:29.640]   We think an individual who has registered for access downloaded and shared the data.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:33.040]   The CDNet says, in fact, it doesn't look like that.
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:41.040]   It was stored on an insecure Akamai CDN and a hacker just found it.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.120]   This is like the equivalent of an unsecured S3.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.400]   It happens all the time.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.320]   It happens all the time.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.840]   Yeah, it happens all the time.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.400]   And I guess it just happened again to...
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.160]   There was someone right next to it, the Galaxy Note renders.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.320]   We're stored.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.240]   The Pixel 5 images.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.280]   All that stuff in the same unsecured server.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.080]   Am I the only one who feels bad for Intel?
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.960]   It feels like I can't catch a screen.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:08.960]   I know.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.280]   Well, I mean, I love the company.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:12.200]   I guess in a way they brought it on themselves.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.200]   I don't know.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.040]   We have many friends now.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:22.280]   Ryan Shrout, Alan Melvantano, both went to Intel to work in marketing.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.320]   It's not too late to come back, guys.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.440]   They lost their engineering focus.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:30.200]   Sort of like when Steve Bomer took over at Microsoft and they were very good at selling
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.360]   what was, but they were willing to sacrifice what could be to keep selling it.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:39.160]   It feels like when Intel went away from having engineering and technical leads and started
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.640]   putting marketing people in charge, it was the same thing.
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:46.240]   These server chips are bringing in a fortune and that success hit all of these problems.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:51.080]   Underneath them, there was just no direction on the engineering and their process.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:52.960]   Their architecture slipped.
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:57.360]   They said, "Oh, seven nanometers not going to be affected by the slowdown in 10 nanometer."
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.560]   It's a different thing.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.560]   It turns out that's affected too because same problem, different symptom.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:10.960]   Do you remember when AMD released the Athlon and it was incredible.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:14.760]   Intel was able to respond within a couple of months with their next generation architecture,
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.960]   which told everyone they had it.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:21.360]   They were sitting on it so that they could milk their current line of process.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.520]   They haven't been able to do that.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.680]   They don't have a response to Ryzen.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.000]   It was the same thing with Qualcomm.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.480]   They were sitting on 64-bit because they wanted to get recoup as much money as they
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.920]   could on 32-bit.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:35.360]   The A7 came out, but they had it.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.280]   They had to rush the market.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:40.920]   That only works when you have competent engineering teams who have that technology.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.480]   You're using Athlon now, right, Robert?
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.280]   I've got split.
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.520]   Half of my systems are still Intel and half are Ryzen.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.480]   If you were going to build a new one, Ryzen, 100%.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.480]   Yeah, I'd be close.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.480]   I didn't even close.
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.480]   And Gen 3 is coming, right?
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:57.880]   It's going to be even better.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.280]   Big Navi is coming, it's going to be even better in graphics.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:03.800]   They're just firing on all five nanometer cylinders right now.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:08.160]   I mean, the budget Ryzen processors are better than the mainstream Intel processors.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.440]   Ah, it just breaks my heart.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:10.800]   What have I...
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.640]   Talk about fumbling.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.600]   And honestly, we need Intel to be a strong competitor.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.920]   It's important for everybody.
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:22.400]   We used to say that about AMD.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.400]   I know.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.760]   Thank you, AMD, for keeping it to honest.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.760]   But then they didn't come with a couple.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760]   Remember with Pentia?
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:28.760]   And then they came out with a core architecture.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.760]   I take it.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:30.760]   And yeah, I take it.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.080]   And they came out with a core architecture.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:34.600]   And there's just, there's no sign they have that in their back pocket this time.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.560]   They're going to have to work hard.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.480]   That's why I'm all my money, I'm pushing in all my chips on Apple Silicon.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.520]   Well, but it's going to be purpose built.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.760]   Like they're not building a general purpose.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:46.760]   Right.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.320]   They're not building merchant silicon.
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:51.720]   And the huge advantage they have there is that, for example, if you are doing that, you
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:56.520]   have to support OpenGL and it's very invoking and stuff on Linux and you have to support
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.240]   DirectX and it's elk for Windows.
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.800]   And you have to make a profit on the chip.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:04.520]   You're profit and loss based on the chip where Apple, they have, they're just care about
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.280]   making money on the whole device.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.600]   And that means they don't wait on 64 bit.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.600]   They don't wait on anything.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.680]   They run as fast as they can specifically for what the hardware they're building.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.880]   So it's a very different proposition.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:22.280]   Lexi, I feel like we're leaving you out of this conversation.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:25.720]   Did you just go make a Joffel while we were talking here?
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.920]   Yeah, you know, that's exactly it.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.520]   I was making a Joffel and building a PC with the latest rise in Chirre.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.520]   Good.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.520]   Thank you.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:37.800]   So interesting because I do like remember back in the day when I was, you know, in my
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:42.400]   PC building era was it was Intel AMD.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:46.440]   And if you chose an AMD chip, you were just like, what are you doing?
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.440]   Like, why, why?
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.240]   Like, there's no reason to do that.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.880]   And it's just so interesting as, you know, someone who hasn't been following that as
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.920]   closely to just sort of come back into this fear and go, hang on a minute.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.920]   What just happened?
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:01.440]   AMD is now making these, yeah, it's like, rise in.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.440]   What the heck?
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:03.520]   Where did that come from?
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:07.000]   It's just really interesting to see, you know, the battle flipped on its head.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.360]   So, I mean, I, as an interested observer rather than someone who is like deep into the
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:18.200]   weeds with it all the time, I, I had to just welcome the competition and considering that
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:23.360]   I built my first PC in a very, very long time and I chose to do it with the new AMD rise
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.680]   in, you know, the cheaper one that just came out.
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:28.000]   There was a reason why I chose that.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.120]   I didn't even look at choosing an Intel.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:33.520]   It was just so interesting to sort of have a really flipped.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:35.520]   Mm hmm.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.480]   Well, we live in interesting times.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.920]   That's all I can say.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.720]   What a, what a, what a year, what a decade.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.720]   Wow.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.720]   Wow.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.560]   Our show today brought to you by a mattress.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:54.480]   You know, this is high tech with just the right amount of both sink and bounce.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.480]   I don't know how they do it, but they've done it.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.080]   We love our Casper mattresses.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.960]   And I say that in plural.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:06.040]   Casper kind of invented this whole idea of instead of having a store, a middleman that
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.000]   marks it up 100%, why don't we sell direct to customers?
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.520]   But first they had an engineer and amazing mattress.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:17.640]   And that's what they did, the original Casper mattress cleverly designed to mimic human
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:21.920]   curves, giving supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.520]   You spend a third of your life sleeping.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.520]   You should be comfortable.
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:29.400]   The original Casper combines multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface with
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.280]   the right amount of both just both sink and bounce.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.720]   It's breathable design helps you sleep cool on these hot summer nights.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.880]   I'm so glad.
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.960]   I'm so glad it regulates your body temperature throughout the night.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.160]   Now, this is not the original.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:46.640]   I am now, I am now rocking the Casper hybrid.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:51.720]   I love this mattress combines the pressure relief of the award winning foam with durable
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:59.080]   yet gentle springs, even, even Sammy, our little black and white cat just loves.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.080]   Here she comes.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:03.400]   Here she comes to spend a little time with me on the Casper.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:06.400]   She even, even she loves it.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.480]   They come in those little compact, surprisingly compact boxes.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:15.240]   Once a king size mattress, you open it up and it's ready to go.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.400]   First night, breeze, wonderful.
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:21.480]   They've also got the wave which features a patent pending premium support system, the
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:24.080]   mirror, the natural shape of your body.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.040]   The essential, which is great for kids or college students, is streamlined design at
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.480]   a price that won't keep you up at night.
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:36.840]   Over 20,000 reviews with an average of 4.8 stars on the Casper site Amazon and Google.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:39.720]   It is rapidly becoming the internet's favorite mattress.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:42.560]   I know it's Sammy's favorite mattress.
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.600]   You know what's great about it?
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.120]   You don't have to go to a mattress store to try a mattress before you buy.
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:52.760]   Casper has a 100 night sleep on a trial, absolutely risk free.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:55.200]   Free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.920]   If for any reason it's not right within the first 100 nights, call them.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.800]   They'll come, they'll take it away, refund you every penny, no risk.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.520]   That's in the US and Canada.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:06.560]   I love Casper.
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:07.560]   There's all the mattresses.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.560]   Here's what you do.

[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:06.040]   It turns out Google's been listening again.
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.040]   Dang it.
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:08.040]   To customer feedback?

[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:17.480]   Without permission or authorization, they accidentally turned on a feature that allowed
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:23.000]   its AI-based assistant to activate automatically and listen to what's going on.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:28.200]   Normally, it waits for the "Hey, you know who."
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.680]   People noticed that their Google homes have been recording random sounds without any
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:37.280]   wake word because they would get notifications on their phone that showed the device had
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.640]   heard things like a smoke alarm beeping.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.120]   This is for safety, right?
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.960]   You could turn that off.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.520]   It's been supposed to be hardware limited.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:51.080]   You're supposed to have the wake words in hardware and that hardware gates until you
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.480]   hear the hardware locked wake words.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480]   There is no internet connection.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.280]   It should be physically impossible for stuff to happen.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.680]   Apparently, it isn't.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:06.920]   Google, this comes with news that Google invested $450 million in ADT.
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.960]   Looks like they want to get in the home security business.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.200]   Although I say she can bother them, I think, nailed it when she said the real reason that
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:21.680]   Google wants to get in bed with ADT, besides that lovely Casper mattress, is ADT has 20,000
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:27.160]   installers in the US who will now be able to help people set up their Google Nest products
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.160]   as well.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.760]   That's like a big sales force.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.560]   I don't mind my...
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:36.280]   Isn't it great to think that in the future your house will be spying on you?
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.280]   Oh, come on.
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:41.040]   No, so I have a thing like...
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.000]   This is my answer to Mark Zuckerberg and to Sundar Pichai and all of them.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.600]   It's just criminalized data theft the same way that theft of anything else is criminalized.
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:50.600]   I agree.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:51.960]   I'm not saying accident.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:55.080]   If it's an accident and you can prove it was a bug or something, that's fine.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:56.400]   Maybe you pay a fine or something.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:00.760]   But if it was like, "I turned off location and you knew that I turned off location and
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.960]   you still recorded my location," that's CEO jail time.
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:04.960]   I think these come in with...
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:05.960]   I agree.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:06.960]   That way, clean up their ass.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.640]   Let's sit up and take notice.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.160]   Not only did you still record that location, but you sold it.
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:15.600]   So you actively profit from a crime.
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.480]   They kept saying, "We don't sell your data.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:18.480]   It's way too valuable."
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.720]   You get caught selling it to developers.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.360]   That was a whole Facebook scandal with Analytica.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:29.760]   It was selling data.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:35.840]   Alphabet, if it's any consolation, saw its first revenue decline in history.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.520]   But it was from search revenue dropping.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.160]   I think this is a COVID decline.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:42.040]   Of course, YouTube views went up.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:47.760]   But wait, why would it go down if people are staying home and living on the internet?
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.760]   It was panicked.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:49.760]   They didn't want to...
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.760]   Yes.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.480]   One of the first budgets you cut is advertising and marketing budgets.
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.480]   I think it's dumb.
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:57.560]   I think you invest in that stuff because every company that's done well has sort of invested
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.560]   in your reflection.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:59.560]   Now's the time.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.560]   That's right.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:01.560]   They panicked.
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.560]   They did.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:04.560]   I think they're coming back.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:05.560]   We noticed that too with our advertisers, but they seem to be coming back and we're getting
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.600]   new advertisers who exactly like you recognize, "This is the time.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:11.600]   Here's your chance to see..."
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.600]   We're half the audience.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:13.600]   Literally a capital audience.
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.600]   What else are they going to do?
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:16.600]   They're not going to the computers.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:17.600]   Thank you.
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:18.600]   Thank you.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:22.880]   A similar article from Bloomberg with COVID crushing advertising, YouTubers are turning
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.040]   to subscriptions.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.040]   Have you noticed that?
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:27.240]   You're a YouTuber, Renee.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.640]   Have you considered subscriptions?
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:32.240]   So the feature turned on for me recently.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:36.840]   I didn't have it until very, very recently and I haven't done much with it yet, but I
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:39.080]   never wanted to put all my eggs in the YouTube basket.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:43.760]   So I use sponsors like Twit does for the first 30 days.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.760]   Only then do I turn on AdSense.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.360]   I don't use YouTube subscriptions, but I have Patreon because I wanted it in a different
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.480]   bucket, but I haven't really figured out what to do with YouTube subscriptions yet.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:50:00.360]   Jerry Lier's big jet TV is the example Bloomberg uses.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:05.080]   He offers two tiers of subscription, first class and super class.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.080]   You know what he does?
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.040]   This is why I love YouTube.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:13.600]   His entire business revolves around going to airports and filming videos of planes taking
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.600]   off and landing.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.840]   Hey, there's an audience.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:17.840]   There is.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.840]   It's a plane ASMR.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.200]   Is that what it is?
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.760]   I don't know.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:30.520]   85,000 followers and he's charging $5 for the base subscription and $20.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.840]   This is a month for special big jet programming because it's paying for his tickets to go
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:40.960]   to airports like Skippoall and in the Netherlands to take videos of planes.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:50.600]   We're trying to grab a video of the rarely seen Emirates 747 freighter.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:57.120]   I mean, it sounds silly until you realize that people made millions of dollars opening
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:58.520]   up children's toys.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.520]   Right.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.520]   God bless YouTube.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:02.520]   I think that's fantastic.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:07.000]   There would, I mean, you know, network television is not going to give the guy like this an outlet,
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.880]   but the fact that he can make money on YouTube doing that is great.
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:11.880]   Or dad, how do I?
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:15.520]   The guy went, got like millions of subscribers, not overnight, of course, but like very quickly
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.880]   because nobody knew how to tie a tie or fix a hinge or any of that.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.880]   Yes.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:22.600]   I've actually often thought I should have really made that channel because.
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.600]   Yeah, that's what you could do it for tech Leo.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.760]   He's only doing a question for everybody, a question for everyone on the panel.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:36.920]   And that is, do you remember the year where you flipped from spending more time on TV and
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.600]   spending more time on the internet?
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:39.600]   That's an interesting question.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:40.600]   Yes.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:45.560]   The younger you are, the more, I mean, I'm still watching a lot of TV.
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:48.920]   Lexi, you're probably, you watch TV or YouTube.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:54.840]   I mix of both just because there is a glut of streaming services and, you know, with all
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:57.040]   the time in the world, let's try it all.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.840]   There's a lot of TV to watch.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:06.840]   I think the sort of the tipping point for me was when I, I think when I moved to the US
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.760]   and all of the streaming services and YouTube just opened up for me.
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:14.800]   So I think it was probably a little later just because in Australia, you know, internet
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:21.200]   connectivity was not particularly good, at least for much of the country, it is improving,
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:26.320]   but it's nowhere near the level of access and, you know, fiber and stuff that is in
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.320]   the US.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:33.480]   So the reach of YouTube and, you know, other videos, services like Vimeo, it wasn't as
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.480]   good of an experience as it is here.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:41.440]   And so that I think stopped my interest in sort of getting into watching YouTube primarily
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:42.760]   for a little while.
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.880]   But yeah, that was probably like six, seven years ago now.
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:50.440]   So, you know, I would, I would have been much earlier, have the internet been good enough.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:53.680]   Chatroom, I'm surprised that some of the years people are coming up with the answer to your
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:53:01.960]   question, Robert, 2008, 2006, I think Carson's making that up.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:06.960]   But that, when did YouTube start?
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.960]   It didn't start till 2004 or five, right?
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:10.960]   What about you, Robert?
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:11.960]   You watched a lot of YouTube?
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:12.960]   I can tell you exactly.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:17.800]   It was 2013 because when I moved in 2013 from D.C. to San Francisco, I no longer had
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:18.800]   a TV.
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:19.520]   Oh, I don't, I still don't.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.520]   I don't watch TV.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:21.520]   Period.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:24.400]   The only thing I watch on TV right now is F1 racing.
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:30.920]   Our 17 year old soon to be 18 year old Michael, I don't think I've ever seen him watch TV.
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:33.560]   We have to force him.
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:34.560]   It's torture.
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.880]   Sit down and watch a show with us.
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.640]   He says, I don't like your shows.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:42.520]   My God, kids a while ago went to their grandparents and were watching and they had like cable
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:44.200]   TV and they're like, what, what is this?
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:45.760]   Why can't we choose what we want to watch?
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:46.760]   Why is this fixed?
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:47.760]   Why, what is this?
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:48.760]   A commercial?
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:49.760]   What is a commercial?
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:50.760]   What is this?
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:51.760]   It was awesome.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:55.360]   Meanwhile, Michael, Michael will, Michael will always be streaming YouTube like he's eating
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:00.360]   dinner, everything is, YouTube's with him 24 seven video game while watching someone
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:01.960]   play video game on YouTube.
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:06.040]   Yes, literally and talking to his friends.
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:10.640]   People talk about saying, well, $30 for Mulan is easy because I mean, if I've got a household,
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:14.640]   but can you actually get a household to sit for two hours and watch one thing?
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:15.640]   No.
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:17.600]   Yes, as long as they have a phone in their hand and they're on the second screen.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.040]   That's exactly what happens.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:24.680]   Michael says, all right, I'll sit with you and then he is watching his YouTube while he
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:28.240]   pretends to watch TV with us.
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:31.360]   So I think it has to do with age more than anything.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:37.400]   I think my son, same thing, he hasn't watched TV probably ever.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.800]   I think we watched The Office when it was on and that was the last thing he watched.
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:46.200]   So good question, Robert.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:51.280]   What really has happened, I think mostly is not that YouTube has pushed TV out.
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:54.320]   Maybe it has for the youngs, but that it's just become a compliment.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:59.480]   So now we just have, like you said, Lexi, an infinite amount of content to watch.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.840]   Although it's a little depressing, there's no new movies.
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:03.840]   I want to watch it.
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:05.800]   It's going to be even worse next year.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:09.440]   YouTube, YouTube tells me which shows I want to watch because I will watch clips and I'll
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:11.640]   go, okay, I'll invest in the season.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:13.000]   Let's see how this works.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.480]   Oh, that's a smart idea.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.480]   But it's instant gratification.
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.120]   That's why TV can't compete, like at least traditional TV because it was fixed programming,
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:21.360]   fixed land, if you're willing to sit through commercials.
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:24.840]   And they're sure there's ads on YouTube, but you can stop, start, go everywhere.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:29.720]   And we know, like we know this through everything, even video games, people will not pay for
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:32.920]   something, but they'll pay for like instant and ego gratification.
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.800]   They'll pay unlimited amounts of money for that.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:39.360]   And that's what a lot of social feeds and YouTube videos and streaming services capitalize
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:40.360]   on.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:43.920]   And I forget what it was, but someone said they had to change their entire TV show because
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:49.840]   oh, it was, there was a video explaining how they changed that Arlo Finch movie when
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:51.640]   they realized it was going to go on to Disney Plus.
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:54.680]   They basically rereaded the entire beginning of the movie.
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:58.400]   And if you watch it, no one talks on camera because they had to change everything and
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:02.600]   then do everything through ADR because if someone goes to the movie theater, they watch
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:04.640]   the whole movie and there's word of mouth.
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.280]   But on a streaming service, if you don't get what you want in the first five minutes,
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:09.720]   you switch to something else.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:12.840]   So they couldn't make him a villain in the movie because they thought it would turn off
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:17.760]   people on training services who weren't stuck there for the entire movie to find out that
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:18.760]   he's redeemed.
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:22.320]   They had to change the entire movie to make him redeemed at the beginning, just not to
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:23.320]   alienate viewers.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.120]   And I lost my mind watching this.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:26.120]   That's depressing.
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.760]   Now Arlo Finch is a young adult fiction.
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:35.000]   So yes, they're aiming at 16, 15, 14 year olds, but still that is a depressing thought that
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.680]   we will not be able to have anything that's at all complicated.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:44.120]   Yes, if it doesn't get you in five minutes, it's over.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.520]   They thought he was unlikable and people would stop watching the stream.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:48.360]   So they had to fix that in post.
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.800]   But they wouldn't in a movie theater.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:52.800]   Lexi, I bet you...
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:53.800]   But we've done that before.
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:54.800]   I bet you spend more time making TV.
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:56.280]   Look at what Fox did the fire to firefly.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.280]   Oh, they ruined firefly because they wouldn't show it in order.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.880]   Why wouldn't they show it in order?
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:01.880]   What was the reaction?
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:06.840]   Because they said, oh, they don't think that people will wait until episode three to like
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:10.680]   it, actually be invested in the characters.
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.560]   So they ruined it, basically.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:18.320]   Lexi, I bet you spend more time making shows about cooking than you do watching.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:24.240]   You know, that's a really interesting thing because especially during this time, the separation
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.640]   between work and recreation, the line is incredibly blurred.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.240]   So what I do is create content all the time.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:36.080]   And then I sit down and relax and watch content.
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:39.120]   And it's just like I'm producing it as I'm watching it.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:43.720]   So it's really interesting to sort of how that weird disconnect going on in my brain
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:45.680]   because it's no longer a relaxation.
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:48.400]   It's now just an extension of the day.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.760]   But I think to the points that we've just already brought up about like the nature of
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:58:00.560]   how content is changing, I don't necessarily know if it's a bad thing because it's giving
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:03.600]   the opportunity to tell stories in a completely different way.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:07.040]   And that's kind of what I like about how all of the different streaming services are
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.320]   kind of experimenting with how they're producing content.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:16.000]   We talked earlier about Quibi not doing it the way that is sort of mobile first, which
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.280]   is what it should have been.
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:23.640]   It should have been like the TikTok, Instagram model of creators in YouTube making content
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:28.200]   that resonates with a specific audience and doing it really, really well and not necessarily
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:29.560]   high budget.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:34.480]   But going the other way, making it super high budget and super produced and the Hollywood
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:36.800]   model just doesn't translate.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:39.600]   And so I think all these platforms are suddenly realizing that.
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:44.880]   And you see the shows that are being commissioned on the Hulus, on the HBO Maxes.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:50.400]   They're taking more risks, I think, than if they were being produced in another environment.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:54.760]   So I kind of like the fact that things are changing and shifting.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:58.360]   Maybe that's just because it's the way I kind of grew up watching all of these different
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:01.600]   forms of content in different spaces and how they all adapt.
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:04.600]   So I think it's not necessarily a bad thing.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.320]   It can be used in a really cool way to tell stories.
[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:12.320]   I know that I've been watching so much content over this whole past few months.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:16.680]   And I've actually found a lot of really interesting shows and narratives are totally different
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:18.280]   to what I would normally go for.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:21.560]   And it's just like, oh, I never thought of doing it like that.
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:22.960]   That's actually really, really smart.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.240]   So some things are going to work for everything.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:30.960]   But I think for some reason it's not all doom and gloom for absolutely every piece of content.
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:35.640]   Because if you're sitting down and watching a movie, you're setting yourself up for that
[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:40.280]   experience over two hours and you have to mentally put yourself in that headspace.
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:44.720]   But if it's on a different platform, you have a little bit more flexibility with the audience.
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:46.360]   Or they're just going to be on their phones.
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:47.520]   I don't know which one it's going to be.
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:49.280]   It's probably going to be the latter, isn't it?
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:52.680]   I don't want to be the old guy that says, oh, it should always be like the way I grew
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:56.480]   up with long form everything.
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:00.200]   So my first reaction is, oh my God, you guys have no attention span.
[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.280]   But you could do stuff, very interesting and very different stuff in short form.
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.560]   And look at TikTok as a perfect example of your short form.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:07.040]   It's very interesting.
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:10.440]   So I don't want to be that old guy.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:11.440]   Is there going to be--
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:12.440]   No, they get the clouds.
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:15.360]   Is there going to be room?
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.560]   Just I'm asking for a friend.
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:21.480]   Is there going to be room for two hour podcasts in the future?
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.480]   Yeah.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:24.480]   Can you just come back?
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.520]   Absolutely.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:27.520]   It goes around.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:31.520]   Look, I mean, for the longest time, TV was stuck in everything reality show.
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:33.240]   Oh, that was a bad period.
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.320]   It was a bad period.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.320]   And you know what?
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:39.320]   I think a lot of the short format stuff has sort of broken that and they're realized,
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:41.000]   OK, we need to change.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.680]   So I don't think we need to lament too much as much as we need to make it clear there
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:49.560]   are certain types of content that we enjoy and there are certain platforms that serve
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:50.560]   that content best.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:55.960]   And also, I'm not listening to the Twitter podcast as much as I used to, but I'm watching
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:57.960]   the streams way more than I ever used to.
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:59.480]   Like I sit there editing and I have--
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:00.480]   You want the company.
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:01.480]   And almost endless streams.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.000]   It's more about company now for you.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.360]   I feel like I'm watching you and Micah and everybody.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:08.440]   And I'm like, oh, I'm not alone in the house.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.440]   Yeah.
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:11.680]   Well, that's my background.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:16.080]   Working in radio, you realize very quickly you're not a priority.
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.520]   You're not foreground entertainment.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:18.520]   You're background.
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:20.120]   You're in the background.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:25.000]   And people just like the comforting voice and the kind of murmur going on in the background.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.400]   Nobody's really listening.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:27.880]   You know what?
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:29.720]   We're car talk.
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.720]   We're car talk.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:34.040]   No one listened to car talk to get real advice.
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:39.280]   They listened because it was two familiar voices who were sometimes funny, but they were
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.640]   there every single week.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:41.640]   Well, people still read--
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:42.640]   They do think up the advice.
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.880]   Well, people still read long books or long, even long articles.
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:53.280]   Will there be room for long, thoughtful development of ideas or is it just going to be, it's got
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.280]   a hit now or a mess?
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.280]   It will always be.
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:56.280]   It will always be.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:57.280]   Yeah.
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.280]   Yeah.
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.280]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:03.760]   Like Axiom End just came out and it's already on the New York Science best seller charts.
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:05.920]   I think that will always be the case.
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:08.440]   Whether they're reading it as an actual book or they're reading it on a Kindle or they're
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.760]   reading it on an iPad or they're reading it on a fan.
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:11.760]   What came out?
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:12.760]   What is it?
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:14.360]   Lindsay Ellis is Axiom's End.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.280]   Is this a big deal that I should know about?
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:21.720]   Yeah, Lindsay is a huge internet commentary personality and this is her first, I think
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:23.440]   it's her first fiction book.
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:28.080]   Oh, a novel in the Numena saga.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.880]   Numena number one, is it sci-fi?
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:31.880]   Yep.
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:33.680]   Is it good?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:38.000]   I've just started it, but I know Lindsay and I've seen her videos for a long time.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:47.560]   She's done things like deconstructing the Game of Thrones videos and all sorts of things.
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:50.880]   So she's been a non-fiction person for a while.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:55.520]   Well, there's a huge, I don't know what the right word is, but there's a huge subculture
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:00.520]   on YouTube and the internet in general of people who do like hour long, one and a half
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:05.160]   hour long commentary on like what went wrong with Game of Thrones season three or is JK
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:06.960]   around and all sorts of things.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:07.960]   Yeah, who watches that?
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.840]   There's huge numbers of views on those things.
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:10.840]   I know.
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:14.320]   Like there's millions of views.
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:18.000]   There's whole channels that have like hour long videos with 20 million views on them.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000]   Each one.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.960]   Lexi, if you weren't working at CNET, if you weren't working for CBS Interactive and
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:30.440]   you were just doing your own thing, what would it be?
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.440]   Making cats.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:33.440]   No.
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:34.440]   Just teasing.
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.440]   I definitely don't.
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:37.440]   I don't know.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:38.440]   I've loved tech.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:44.840]   I've been into tech ever since I was a very small girl.
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:47.200]   You know, I did computer science.
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:50.280]   I'm like, this is it for life for me.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:54.520]   It's going to be creating some sort of tech related content, I guess.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.440]   I don't know what that's going to be.
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:01.680]   The platforms are all going to shift and the way it's created is going to shift.
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:04.520]   It's just that, you know, that's what I love.
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:05.520]   That's the focus.
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:10.080]   Did you start writing or did you start video?
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:13.880]   I started coding actually.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:15.440]   That's how I started.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:16.440]   Yeah.
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:17.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:18.440]   So I was a programmer.
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:22.800]   I studied computer science and then I decided that the programming world was not for me.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:26.280]   So I finished that and then I discovered my love for writing and then I thought, well,
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:30.000]   let's just merge the two, see if that's possible.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.840]   So then video is just the natural kind of, you know, the way I moved afterwards.
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:38.240]   I came from radio background too.
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:41.320]   So it was just kind of like this perfect storm of all these interests kind of merging
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:44.880]   together and then, yeah, then they pay me to make videos.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:45.880]   So I'm happy about that.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:46.880]   Not a bad life.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:47.880]   No, I know.
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:51.520]   Look, my house is basically a glorified best buy now.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:54.840]   So I'm not complaining at all.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:56.800]   Just there's just no room to put anything.
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:02.480]   The bad thing about doing this, what we do, Lexi, is it's so easy to do this, you stop
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:06.680]   writing because writing is such hard work compared to just blathering.
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:09.760]   Yes and no.
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:14.960]   It's actually quite nice to have the because we create videos and then usually there's
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:16.800]   an accompanying article or a piece.
[02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:18.160]   You still have to write, yeah.
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:19.840]   Yeah, I still have to write.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:23.760]   But it's actually quite interesting because the video is more like the, this is me, my
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:28.720]   personality, the free form of thoughts and my experiences using it and you know how I
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:31.360]   think it's what's going to be interesting to the audience.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:35.800]   And I kind of try and inject in some of the videos that I do a little bit of humor and
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:40.080]   a little bit of, you know, that kind of reason why you watch YouTube, right?
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:44.640]   And then you kind of have to shift your brain into going, all right, now let's condense all
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:50.080]   of those kind of a little bit free form, you know, slightly more unscripted into something
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.280]   that is structured and, you know, written down on paper.
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.880]   That's the part I hate.
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:59.920]   And what, yes, because, but the thing is, the good thing about it is it actually really
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:01.360]   helps crystallize your thoughts.
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:02.360]   It's important.
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:03.360]   I completely agree.
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.360]   Yeah.
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:05.360]   So important.
[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:09.480]   But it's hard because you've done all the work, like you've made a video and you've poured
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.840]   your heart and soul into it.
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:14.000]   And then you go, all right, I've got to write a thousand words on this.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.880]   All right, here we go.
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:17.160]   Do I have it in me?
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:18.400]   Writing is thinking.
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:19.400]   It's hard work.
[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:20.400]   Yeah.
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:21.600]   Everything is thinking.
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:22.600]   Everything.
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:24.800]   Yeah, but I don't have to think to do this.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.480]   That's why I start with the writing.
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:29.760]   I do the writing first and then I do the video.
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:31.320]   Oh, that would be easier.
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:32.320]   Then you do that.
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:33.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:34.920]   That's why I'm just a glutton for punishment.
[02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.160]   I like to do the fun thing first.
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:37.160]   And then you have to go.
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:38.160]   All right.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.160]   Me too.
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:40.160]   I always do the fun thing.
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:41.160]   And then I forget to do the hard thing.
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:44.320]   I just don't do it.
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:45.560]   All right, let's take a little break.
[02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:47.560]   More to come with a wonderful panel.
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:50.600]   Renee Richie is slumming with us from Mac Break Weekly.
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:57.280]   It's so nice to have you and also youtube.com/ReneeRitchie from CNET Lexi Savittis who is so great,
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:59.360]   so talented senior editor over there.
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.960]   Got to watch your videos and follow her on Instagram.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:02.960]   What's your Instagram handle?
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:03.960]   It's just my name.
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:05.960]   I'm just on there at Lexi Savittis.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:06.960]   Okay.
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:07.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:08.960]   I'm sat on Twitter and everything.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:09.960]   Yeah, great.
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:10.960]   Great Instagram stuff.
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:11.960]   That's good.
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:14.200]   And of course, Father Robert, he's the digital Jesuit.
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:15.760]   People say, "What's the DJ mean?
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:16.760]   Are you a DJ?
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:17.760]   What is the DJ?
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.800]   It's digital Jesuit."
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:25.680]   And he's actually in his studio in Vatican City, right?
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:27.520]   Right outside, that's St. Peter's, right over there.
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:29.480]   This is the one you built.
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:30.480]   Is it upstairs?
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:32.800]   I built three.
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:34.120]   So this is the one on the roof.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:35.120]   Yeah.
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.080]   This is, and it's above where you live.
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:38.080]   Correct.
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:39.080]   Nice.
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:42.120]   When you say roof, you're not outside though.
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:47.920]   Yes, actually this is above the roof.
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.800]   It really is a rooftop studio.
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:50.800]   Can you show us the view?
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.240]   Which means it gets incredibly hot.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:54.320]   It's nighttime, so it's dark out there.
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:55.560]   It is nighttime.
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:08:00.960]   And I actually had to cover the picture window because the sun is just too bright.
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:04.440]   What was this room before you turned it into a studio?
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.920]   This was a broom closet.
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:12.160]   And I believe it was a homeless shelter for pigeons and seagulls by the droppings.
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:14.440]   Ah ha!
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:20.000]   Okay, just so they gave you some prime real estate.
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.080]   They didn't give it to me.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:26.080]   I may have just started working on it because the door was left open.
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:28.280]   They don't even know it's there, do they?
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:29.280]   They do now.
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:31.360]   Has the Holy Father been upstairs to visit?
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.360]   Yes, he has.
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:33.360]   He has.
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:34.360]   He has.
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:35.360]   Wow.
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:39.040]   What were you doing up there?
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:40.840]   He comes over every once in a while.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.800]   We were actually celebrating Ignatius Day at the end of July and he comes to have lunch
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:47.360]   and a coffee with his brothers.
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:48.440]   You taught it as I.
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:52.720]   So is Saint Ignatius your patron saint?
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:56.640]   He's the guy who started the Jesuits.
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:59.680]   I knew there was a word that I should have used instead of mascot.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.680]   But I get, okay, yeah.
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:02.680]   So, that's got works.
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.320]   I'll go with that.
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.920]   That's awesome.
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:07.920]   That's awesome.
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.640]   It's great to have all three of you.
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:11.960]   I showed they brought to you by Salesforce.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:13.840]   We use Salesforce religiously here.
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:17.000]   It's a really great tool for keeping track of your customers.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:22.240]   It's also, as it turns out, a really great tool for serving your customers.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:26.840]   This week in tech brought to you by the Salesforce Service Cloud.
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:30.380]   Salesforce Service Cloud wants you to be prepared during these difficult times, these
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:31.380]   unknown times.
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:36.200]   They know you're trying to do more with less resources.
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:39.980]   You're hustling to adapt to new customer needs.
[02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:43.900]   You have to innovate your business to respond to the current environment.
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:45.500]   Satisfied customers is job one.
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:46.980]   I have to think.
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:50.820]   That means you need a platform that performs quickly and efficiently to meet your customers'
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:54.060]   needs and meet your needs as you're meeting your customers' needs.
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:58.660]   That's Service Cloud, the world's number one customer service platform.

[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:26.340]   portals connecting customers to information they need, articles, account info, and community
[02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:28.460]   members to find those answers instantly.
[02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:30.580]   Yes, that's all built into Service Cloud.
[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:37.320]   And because Service Cloud has AI, you'll work smarter and bad AI-powered chatbots to help

[02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:04.060]   They like to feel the relationship with your service reps.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:08.780]   Allow them to always respond with the right level of service as needed.

[02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:03.220]   is the way to do it.
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:06.980]   I just want to make one quick note.
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:11.460]   I always save the obituaries to the end.
[02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:14.060]   This isn't a sad obituary.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:16.300]   Well, it sort of is.
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:20.220]   I wanted to mention Francis E. Allen.
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:22.660]   Not well known.
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:29.940]   Unless you're a language, you're a coder like Lexi or you're a language fan, but her story
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:32.140]   is really remarkable.
[02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:42.180]   She was born on a farm without running water in Peru, New York, 88 days ago.
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:47.140]   She died August 4th on her 88th birthday, so 88 plus a few days ago, years ago I should
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:51.300]   say, days, 88 years ago.
[02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:52.580]   She wanted to be a teacher.
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:56.180]   She graduated from the New York State College for teachers.
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:57.180]   It's now SUNY Albany.
[02:12:57.180 --> 02:12:58.900]   She was up there in Upper New York State.
[02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:06.740]   She got a bachelor's in mathematics in 1954, began teaching math and school back in Peru,
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:07.740]   New York.
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:10.700]   Two years later, she decided I like math.
[02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:12.780]   She wanted to get an MS in math.
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:18.060]   She went to the University of Michigan, earned her masters in 1957, but was kind of crippled
[02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:20.780]   as many of us are with student loans.
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:24.820]   She said, before I go back to teach, because that was her first love, I'm going to get
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:30.260]   a quick job, make some money at IBM Research in Poughkeepsie as a programmer.
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:33.380]   This is back in 1957.
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:35.940]   She never left 45 years later.
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:38.860]   She ended her career at IBM when she retired.
[02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:44.900]   She taught incoming employees for Tran.
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:46.500]   She retired in 2002.
[02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:47.900]   Was still a fellow emeritus.
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:51.220]   She became an IBM Fellow, which is the highest award.
[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:54.380]   IBM can give you and won the Turing Award.
[02:13:54.380 --> 02:14:00.820]   The highest award computer science can give you, because she was a pioneer in compilers,
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:04.820]   compiler organization and optimization algorithms.
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:11.580]   She made contributions that have changed the way software is made even to this day.
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:17.420]   Her work on inter-procedural analysis and automatic parallelization is currently the
[02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:25.180]   leading edge of compiler research, even though she did that work in the 60s and 70s.
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:27.220]   An amazing person.
[02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:32.620]   I want to acknowledge her, because I don't think she's well known to the general public,
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:33.740]   even to the technical public.
[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:38.060]   She's probably well known to anybody who's ever designed a compiler or learned about
[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:39.900]   how compilers work.
[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:45.100]   She was the first female IBM Fellow, the first female winner of the Turing Award, a
[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:48.380]   Fellow of the IEEE and the ACM.
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:56.300]   They even created the IEEE Francis E. Allen Medal in her honor, passed away of Alzheimer's
[02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:00.140]   at the age of 88 this week.
[02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:01.300]   I think it's so important.
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:09.300]   She was through the rest of her life an advocate for women in STEM and women in coding.
[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:15.420]   God knows we desperately need more diversity in the software and hardware that we use every
[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:22.860]   day, because if it's got only the point of view of a bunch of white guys, it's just
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:27.700]   not going to be the software we want, the software we need, the software we deserve.
[02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:29.980]   We should remember Francis E. Allen.
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:30.980]   Go ahead.
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:36.860]   There's something there that I think everyone needs to remember, and that is today we take
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:38.780]   it for granted that you can have a compiler.
[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.900]   There's several different types of compilers.
[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:45.700]   There's ways to organize your code, but there had to be someone who started with the idea
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:53.380]   that there's a more efficient way to program a computer than flipping switches.
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:58.660]   There's a shared language that we can create that will help us organize our thoughts into
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:02.620]   something that can actually be run through a computational machine.
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:05.740]   The first person to do that had to be visionary.
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:08.060]   I mean, now we know it's possible.
[02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:11.580]   It's like the first time that you go into space, that's when you have to be visionary.
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:12.580]   After that, you're duplicating.
[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:14.940]   You're trying to enhance.
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:20.940]   But that first effort out the door needs to get so much recognition because it laid
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:25.940]   the foundation for everything, everything that came after.
[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:33.220]   It's the thing that turns something human readable into something the machine can act
[02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:34.220]   upon.
[02:16:34.220 --> 02:16:35.700]   Lexi, I'm sure knows it.
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:37.900]   What languages did you code in?
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:39.380]   No, lots of things.
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:41.380]   C, C++, Java.
[02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:45.700]   What did you learn on?
[02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:48.140]   What did they make you learn when you started?
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:49.140]   C.
[02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:50.460]   C is the most beautiful.
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:51.460]   I love C.
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:52.900]   No, I loved it.
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:58.700]   You can turn a hand and Richie, the C programming language is this thick.
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:01.420]   It was the first language, the first real language I learned.
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:05.660]   I learned basic, of course, but the first real language I learned was C. To this day,
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:09.100]   I consider it elegant, beautiful, a real masterpiece.
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:11.820]   They started me with Fortran in Pascal.
[02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:13.660]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:16.860]   I learned Pascal because I had to in the early days of the Macintosh.
[02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:18.420]   That's how you coded it.
[02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:19.820]   Pascal is kind of a nightmare.
[02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:22.700]   C just feels natural and beautiful.
[02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:26.060]   Of course, it has plenty of pitfalls.
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:31.860]   A lot of the bugs and exploits we get in code today really goes back to that idea that
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:36.660]   we're going to make a language so powerful that the programmer can dig a hole for herself
[02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:38.100]   and fall right into it.
[02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:39.460]   Like Steve Gibson.
[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:44.580]   Nobody, but Steve, Steve gives the last guy writing a similar.
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:47.740]   C is very close to the metal.
[02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:51.500]   I have respect for anyone who can write high level in assembly.
[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:56.260]   You know, as somebody, I wrote a lot of assembly code early on because I hated Pascal so much,
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:59.300]   I ended up writing a 68,000 assembler for the Mac.
[02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:01.260]   And it was actually easier than Pascal.
[02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:05.500]   What happens, and I guarantee you it's what's happened with Steve, is as you do it, you eventually
[02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:10.700]   you start writing macros and in effect you create your own high level language.
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:17.620]   So you're writing in a language that is much more fluent than typing, you know, move six
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:19.420]   to four.
[02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:23.620]   Well, if you're proficient in assembly, you've essentially created your own compiler because
[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:24.620]   you've got a library of them.
[02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:25.620]   You're the compiler.
[02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:27.020]   You're the compiler.
[02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:28.580]   You're the compiler.
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:33.900]   Yeah, I actually loved writing 68,000 assembler because it has a flat memory model.
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:37.180]   It was very straightforward at a very logical instruction set.
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:43.860]   And then I took a look at the 8086 and I said, I'm never writing assembly code for this thing.
[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:45.780]   It's a nightmare.
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:47.300]   It's a nightmare.
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:52.140]   You wrote a great piece this week on CNET Lexi on Black Girls Code.
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:53.700]   Tell us about that.
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:54.940]   Yeah.
[02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:59.320]   I had the great honor of talking to Kimberly Bryant, she's the CEO and founder of Black
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:00.320]   Girls Code.
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:04.580]   And we had a really wide ranging discussion and something that's personally a big passion
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:09.940]   point for me is getting more women in the industry and especially women of color because
[02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:14.380]   you know, we all know that women are super underrepresented in the tech industry and
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:16.380]   women of color, especially so.
[02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:21.500]   And you know, Kimberly really brought some great points to our discussion that, you know,
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:25.900]   women of color have just been, you know, less and less and less of them are following through
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:29.300]   into positions within the tech industry.
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:33.700]   So it's, you know, when she was studying engineering back in, when she was studying, I think in
[02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:37.140]   the 80s, you know, the representation levels were around 30%.
[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:44.020]   And now if you look at the numbers of women of color in tight positions and STEM careers,
[02:19:44.020 --> 02:19:46.020]   it's around 3%.
[02:19:46.020 --> 02:19:51.260]   So it's very clear that there needs to be a lot more representation and her organization
[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:56.100]   is doing some great work in making sure that, you know, these young girls are getting the
[02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:59.860]   support, the resources and the education to do things.
[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:00.860]   It's not just coding.
[02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:05.940]   It's everything from, you know, experimenting with virtual reality, getting into robotics
[02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:08.060]   and even the makers sort of style of things.
[02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:09.380]   It's fantastic what they're doing.
[02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:13.120]   And I just, I really wanted to profile her and just, you know, get the opportunity to
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:14.120]   talk to her.
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.900]   So if you have a chance, go check it out.
[02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:17.300]   It was a really great discussion.
[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:22.100]   You know, we discussed everything from, you know, systemic inequalities, you know, how
[02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:27.980]   companies can better diversify, you know, not only their workforce, but also their companies
[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:28.980]   from the ground up.
[02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:33.540]   Because a great point was, she brought up was that it's no, you know, it's great to
[02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:36.700]   have tech companies thinking about diversity and hiring.
[02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:41.180]   But you know, if the structures of these companies are not set up to support those employees,
[02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:44.900]   then, you know, it's a really uphill battle.
[02:20:44.900 --> 02:20:49.700]   So really just working out, actually structurally how to make those changes so tech companies
[02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:54.020]   are really built from the ground up to support is the most important thing.
[02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:58.180]   And yeah, just making sure that there is a, you know, a great pipeline of young women
[02:20:58.180 --> 02:21:03.340]   who are, you know, keen, ready to go and super passionate because they are and they're there.
[02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:07.620]   It's just about, okay, let's make sure that they actually have a supportive network in
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:11.940]   a place where they can continue the great work that they do.
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:18.620]   It's really true that it's a systemic issue, racism is a systemic issue in general.
[02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:21.740]   And because it's in the built into the system, you don't see it.
[02:21:21.740 --> 02:21:25.060]   So you say, well, look, we've got all these black kids coming in and learning how to
[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:26.060]   code.
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:29.940]   See, we fixed it and it's not it at all.
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:35.900]   You have to create an environment that not only brings people in, but nurtures them and
[02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:38.380]   gives them an opportunity and gives them a shot.
[02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:42.380]   And I meant it when I said the last thing you want is a bunch of bros designing your hardware
[02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:43.660]   and software.
[02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:48.740]   That is a recipe for disaster for failure.
[02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:51.660]   And yeah, we really, it's really important.
[02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:57.300]   I don't think it's something we should diminish diversity on the hiring committees, not just
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:58.540]   on the team everywhere.
[02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:03.180]   It's a systemic problem, you know, and, and I'm sure Lexi, you felt that as a woman coming
[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:10.020]   in, you're the one woman on a, you know, team of coders, they may be nice people.
[02:22:10.020 --> 02:22:11.900]   They may not be bad people.
[02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:17.420]   They may not even be sexist people, but you're not in a positive, healthy environment.
[02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:21.940]   It's, it's really interesting because it's not just in the environment that you might
[02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:26.860]   think, like, you know, studying and, you know, in colleges and universities.
[02:22:26.860 --> 02:22:32.820]   It actually even has pervaded the workforce and workplace experiences in, you know, in
[02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:37.260]   the reporting on the tech industry, there was been a number of events that I can, you
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:42.860]   know, I can think off of the top of my head, at least four or five, where as a female tech
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:48.380]   journalist, I was just assumed not to be interested in the technical side of the briefing.
[02:22:48.380 --> 02:22:52.900]   And then instead I was sent with a group of lifestyle journalists to that particular
[02:22:52.900 --> 02:22:53.900]   briefing.
[02:22:53.900 --> 02:22:57.340]   And then I'd be like, I think I'm in the wrong room because all my colleagues and all
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:01.020]   the people that I'm normally with are in that room over there.
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:02.900]   And they're, oh, no, no, that's the technical briefing.
[02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:05.660]   Oh, no, no, that's, that's what I'm actually here for.
[02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:08.660]   I'm, I'm not writing for a lifestyle publication.
[02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:10.340]   I am writing for a technical audience.
[02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:12.220]   So I'd need to be in that room.
[02:23:12.220 --> 02:23:13.700]   So it's just interesting.
[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:16.460]   There's implicit biases that, you know, have come across.
[02:23:16.460 --> 02:23:20.940]   It's, it's like over the course of my career, it has gotten significantly better, but there's
[02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:22.420]   still a lot of work to be done.
[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:26.300]   And, you know, I think now the focus needs to be on diversity and getting people from
[02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:28.220]   a range of different backgrounds, people of color.
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:32.420]   This is very, very important that we don't just have, you know, a monochrome tech industry
[02:23:32.420 --> 02:23:36.580]   because you think of everybody tech is touched and used by everybody.
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:41.060]   So as you say, like having just one group of people creating, you know, the devices
[02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:44.740]   and the software that we use is not going to solve those bigger problems.
[02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:48.660]   We need to have a variety of voices because there's problems that we don't even think
[02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:53.660]   about that are not being solved right now and to have make sure that those voices are
[02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:57.500]   being heard and those products are being developed can only be a good thing.
[02:23:57.500 --> 02:23:58.500]   That's exactly right.
[02:23:58.500 --> 02:23:59.500]   You know, there was a-
[02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:00.500]   I see it.
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:01.500]   Go ahead.
[02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:02.940]   I see it in the world of ops.
[02:24:02.940 --> 02:24:05.860]   Because the best red and blue teams are the most diverse teams.
[02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:06.860]   Oh, interesting.
[02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:09.500]   You don't want a lot of people who are very competent, very good.
[02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:11.260]   Because they're all going to think the same thing.
[02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:12.260]   Yeah.
[02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:13.260]   Yeah.
[02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:14.420]   That makes perfect sense.
[02:24:14.420 --> 02:24:16.100]   This was a complaint people had about TikTok.
[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:17.100]   I thought it was interesting.
[02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:23.180]   A number of black creators said, it's not an, it's not an outright racism, but there's
[02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:28.620]   this co-opting of black culture that happens on TikTok and the white people doing the
[02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:33.180]   black rap is what rises to the top at TikTok.
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:34.620]   It's like that.
[02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:38.420]   It's so insidious and so hard to see it.
[02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:40.420]   Same with the music industry in general.
[02:24:40.420 --> 02:24:41.420]   Exactly.
[02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:46.940]   I think of the contribution black people have made to culture is so, it really frankly
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:58.020]   outsized that it's a shame to just for, because of laziness or inertia, not try to get that
[02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:04.380]   DNA into everything we do, including the hardware and software into technology.
[02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:07.580]   And certainly the point of view of women.
[02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:10.300]   And it's hard.
[02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:11.940]   You say it's getting better, Lexi.
[02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:14.540]   I'm not convinced about that.
[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:21.020]   I feel like people like Brianna Wu when we talk about gamergate and the resistance from
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:25.780]   gamers to anything that might imply that maybe gaming could be a little bit more diverse
[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:34.420]   and a little bit more inclusive strikes me as a problem in the long run.
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:36.380]   By the way, you took, this would be good.
[02:25:36.380 --> 02:25:40.540]   Next time you go into one of those rooms, bring Spot along with you.
[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:41.540]   Yeah.
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:46.300]   A spot, yes, a head spot into the room for me.
[02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:47.300]   This was fun.
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:52.980]   I got the opportunity to remotely drive Spot, a Boston Dynamics Spot robot, the Corduro
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:56.620]   Pad robot from my couch, which as you can see I'm sitting on right now.
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:26:00.500]   And walking around San Francisco, it was so, it was so much fun.
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:03.740]   Oh, now I have a picture of you and it looks like the lip sync is bad, but this is actually
[02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:04.740]   from your video.
[02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:07.260]   I apologize because it's exactly the same.
[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:10.620]   I'm talking and I'm on my house just to say hi.
[02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:12.140]   This is so bizarre.
[02:26:12.140 --> 02:26:16.540]   So you actually, you used a joystick to control this robot?
[02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:18.100]   Oh, there she is again.
[02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:19.100]   That's confusing.
[02:26:19.100 --> 02:26:21.020]   Skip a bit forward into that video.
[02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:22.860]   So this is what you see.
[02:26:22.860 --> 02:26:24.980]   Yeah, so this is the viewpoint of Spot.
[02:26:24.980 --> 02:26:28.500]   So this is technology that's powered by a company called Formant.
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:30.460]   There is San Francisco based startup.
[02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:34.740]   They're essentially connecting robots to the internet and giving humans the ability to
[02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:36.980]   both monitor and remotely control.
[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:43.940]   So using Spot as an example, I was actually able to see like the interface of basically
[02:26:43.940 --> 02:26:45.860]   what Spot sees in its camera.
[02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:47.380]   And that was the main thing on my screen.
[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:49.660]   As you can see, I'm using a PlayStation 3 controller.
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:52.740]   A lot of people were like, why are you using a PS3 controller?
[02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:55.380]   I'm like, because it's the only controller I have in quarantine.
[02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:58.420]   Sorry, I'm sorry to have a PS5.
[02:26:58.420 --> 02:26:59.900]   What's wrong with that?
[02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:00.900]   Come on.
[02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:02.340]   This is what I mean about gamers.
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:03.340]   So intolerant.
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.340]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:08.580]   Oh, it's a PS3 controller.
[02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:12.220]   Anyway, it is what it is.
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:14.020]   So that's all I have.
[02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:19.820]   So yeah, using a controller, or you can use a browser, including a mouse and your trackpad
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:21.780]   to remotely control the robot.
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:23.900]   Why would you want to do this?
[02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:25.900]   Why not is the question, right?
[02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:26.900]   Why not?
[02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:28.900]   Why wouldn't you want to control a $75,000 robot?
[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:31.580]   It seems like a military application.
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:33.580]   Like you might want to, I don't know, attack people.
[02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:37.980]   Well, it's a smart way to Leo, because I don't know if like, if you play dead, does it bat
[02:27:37.980 --> 02:27:42.420]   you around like a bear and walk off or does it start to eat like a cougar?
[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:44.420]   That's my big question here.
[02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:46.100]   It's so scary.
[02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:48.220]   Where was this robot actually in real life?
[02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:49.220]   Where was it?
[02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:50.220]   It was funny.
[02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:52.900]   It was actually very close to where I am in Golden Gate Park, actually.
[02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:53.900]   Oh, how funny.
[02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:54.900]   In Mexico.
[02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:57.740]   Yeah, so it's not just spot that it's used for, obviously.
[02:27:57.740 --> 02:28:02.340]   It's for a range of different robots, you know, underwater drones, you know, other sort
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:03.340]   of drones.
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:04.340]   Oh, sure.
[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:05.340]   The robotics used in agriculture.
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:06.340]   It's a kind of drone.
[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:07.340]   Yeah.
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:08.340]   Yeah.
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:13.300]   It's anything where a human, it's going to be more difficult to be able to manage a fleet
[02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:15.060]   of robots in person.
[02:28:15.060 --> 02:28:20.620]   So any sort of robotic application that you can think of that needs remote management,
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:23.780]   not only for someone controlling it, but also for someone to kind of keep monitoring
[02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:29.080]   it, say, for example, like, oh, X, Y, Z robot needs maintenance now, or, you know, the motor
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:30.660]   is acting up a little bit strange.
[02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:35.140]   So this interface gives, you know, humans a bunch of different, you know, it gets all
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:38.420]   the data points from the robot and you can actually remotely manage it.
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:43.820]   This was just a fun way to show that I could drive a $75,000 robot and I crashed it.
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:45.540]   So she crashed it.
[02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:46.700]   How did you crash it?
[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:48.860]   Is that a little too excited?
[02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:51.300]   Oh, it's a little sexy fashion.
[02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:55.900]   She got super pumped about the fact that I was controlling a robot.
[02:28:55.900 --> 02:28:58.020]   And then I moved the joystick in the wrong direction.
[02:28:58.020 --> 02:29:00.300]   It was like a hundred percent user error.
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:05.100]   Thank goodness it was fine because I don't think I could live with $75,000 of broken
[02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:06.860]   robot on my conscience or my bank.
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:09.180]   I know that there's a guy walking next to it.
[02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:10.700]   Is that just for security?
[02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:13.420]   So let me steal it or is that part of the D?
[02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:16.820]   I mean, do you think he picks up after spot?
[02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:20.340]   Yeah, it gives him treats too.
[02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:25.380]   Just the another set of eyes and ears on the ground.
[02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:30.340]   The best part about this is just like the fun thing is that you can also do it as well.
[02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:31.980]   You can apply to drive spot.
[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:32.980]   Oh, no.
[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:33.980]   Oh, no.
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:37.380]   After losing so many drones, there's no way I'm trying.
[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:39.340]   I'm just a Terminator and the Matrix and all that.
[02:29:39.340 --> 02:29:40.340]   I'm just like do it.
[02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:44.900]   Yeah, they moved a bit like a dog, a bit like an insect, a bit like a zombie and in
[02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:47.020]   a way that my human brain just finds terrifying.
[02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:49.780]   I love how the humans are reacting to this.
[02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:54.780]   Here's some kids who drove by and they stopped the car and looked out the window as you.
[02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:56.740]   Was that kind of fun for you to interact with?
[02:29:56.740 --> 02:29:59.380]   It was really fun because actually I was moving the robot.
[02:29:59.380 --> 02:30:01.460]   They were kind of mimicking the movement as well.
[02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:03.620]   They were kind of like tilting their head either side.
[02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:06.580]   There are a few people that stopped to take selfies.
[02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:09.820]   You know, some people that there was a kind of a stalemate situation where I was ready
[02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:14.540]   to cross a bridge and then the humans stopped but I couldn't get past because they were
[02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:16.980]   just staring, watching, going, I don't know what to do.
[02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:19.500]   It's just really interesting to see like human robot interaction.
[02:30:19.500 --> 02:30:21.500]   This is something that we're going to be having.
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:22.500]   We're going to have to get used to being.
[02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:25.300]   You went down a street.
[02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:26.300]   That wasn't me.
[02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:29.060]   Full disclosure, that is footage from this is terrifying.
[02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:30.380]   Typical San Francisco.
[02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:31.380]   They're just like, yeah, what?
[02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:32.380]   There's a dog.
[02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:33.380]   There's a dog.
[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:35.380]   Yeah, like, oh, whatever.
[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:37.500]   I jump up and run screaming.
[02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:38.500]   Are you kidding?
[02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:40.060]   That's terrifying.
[02:30:40.060 --> 02:30:44.780]   You know, this is awesome and it's cute until there's a dozen of them and they have chain
[02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:47.060]   guns and then the fun zone.
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:48.900]   You just have to vivid imagination.
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:51.500]   No, I read the X-Men when the Sentinels came out.
[02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:52.500]   Come on.
[02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:54.660]   This is like an old thing in the tech now.
[02:30:54.660 --> 02:30:55.660]   Yeah.
[02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:57.700]   I have to do this as a plug for Carsten.
[02:30:57.700 --> 02:30:59.660]   Uh oh.
[02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:01.100]   We talked about this last week.
[02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:02.420]   Brianna Wu was on.
[02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:03.580]   I said, what are you doing tomorrow?
[02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:05.580]   She said, 8 AM.
[02:31:05.580 --> 02:31:06.900]   I am Pacific.
[02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:11.620]   I'm jumping out of bed to buy the analog pocket.
[02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:13.580]   I would think for you, Robert.
[02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:14.580]   It's a Game Boy.
[02:31:14.580 --> 02:31:18.700]   It's a modern Game Boy based on FPGAs.
[02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:22.220]   This Seattle company has made their name doing this.
[02:31:22.220 --> 02:31:23.580]   But it's not just a Game Boy.
[02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:26.900]   First of all, the display is 1600 by 1440.
[02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:27.900]   Okay.
[02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:28.900]   It supports Game Boy.
[02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:31.420]   I think the original Game Boy was 80 by 60.
[02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:32.420]   Yeah.
[02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:34.780]   I don't know what their games are going to look like.
[02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:38.740]   The original Game Boy, it supports as well as the Game Boy Color Advance.
[02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:44.260]   It's got adapters that will let it work with a Game Gear, a Neo Geo, and an Atari Lynx,
[02:31:44.260 --> 02:31:47.740]   which is actually what I would love to use it with.
[02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:53.540]   Unfortunately, I got up at 8.45 and got sold out.
[02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:57.220]   It's completely nicked under Nirvana.
[02:31:57.220 --> 02:32:02.260]   Yeah, I was not a Nintendo guy, but Karsten was apparently because he got up and he got
[02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:03.260]   it.
[02:32:03.260 --> 02:32:05.460]   He told his son, this is your birthday present, Zach.
[02:32:05.460 --> 02:32:06.460]   You have two choices.
[02:32:06.460 --> 02:32:08.260]   You could play with it.
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:12.860]   Or you can sell it unused on eBay for a lot more money than we paid for it and he can
[02:32:12.860 --> 02:32:14.820]   go into your college fund.
[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:19.140]   I told Karsten, I would go to you got two bids, Karsten, they're bidding it up.
[02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:20.140]   Holy cow.
[02:32:20.140 --> 02:32:21.620]   They're bidding it up.
[02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:22.980]   He started at 1200 bucks.
[02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:27.380]   It's now 1325, the analog pocket, but this is the deluxe thing with the dock and the
[02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:32.820]   case and the whole chameel unused two days and 23 hours left.
[02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:35.620]   It expires Wednesday afternoon at 416 PM.
[02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:37.620]   Are you guys sniping Leo?
[02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:39.100]   I'm thinking about it.
[02:32:39.100 --> 02:32:40.100]   It depends what it gets.
[02:32:40.100 --> 02:32:41.620]   Is this or a galaxy fold?
[02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:44.620]   I don't know.
[02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:46.620]   I get up to the same price as the fold.
[02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:47.620]   I think it's going to.
[02:32:47.620 --> 02:32:48.620]   It's on its way.
[02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:49.620]   It's on its way.
[02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:51.060]   I'm trying to find the fold and make a sandwich.
[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:53.180]   I think this would be better than the fold.
[02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:56.020]   So look for analog pocket black.
[02:32:56.020 --> 02:32:57.860]   Frowsy Frowsy is the seller.
[02:32:57.860 --> 02:33:01.060]   I guess that's Karsten's secret eBay name.
[02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:04.420]   Not anymore.
[02:33:04.420 --> 02:33:06.420]   Frowsy Frowsy.
[02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:11.020]   By the way, since it's Karsten, you know you're going to get it.
[02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:13.140]   There's lots of other people selling these.
[02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:15.860]   But this is the guy who's got one or will have one.
[02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:18.420]   It doesn't actually come out for a while.
[02:33:18.420 --> 02:33:24.220]   So you won't actually get it till, I don't know, when next year I think.
[02:33:24.220 --> 02:33:27.900]   But it's the complete set and Karsten's not, we know you know where to find him.
[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:28.900]   Let's put it that way.
[02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:29.900]   Yeah.
[02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:31.100]   You know where the bow tie abides?
[02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:35.460]   Yeah, the bow tie abides, baby.
[02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:39.740]   And I'm moving to New Hampshire because it's going to be the first state to allow flying
[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:43.620]   cars, actually no, I'm not moving there.
[02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:44.620]   That's the first place.
[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:46.340]   I'm staying away.
[02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:50.100]   I'm staying away.
[02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:51.900]   Because humans are really good at two dimensions.
[02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:52.900]   Yeah.
[02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:53.900]   You should give them a third.
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:54.900]   Yeah, why not?
[02:33:54.900 --> 02:34:02.380]   The bill, House Bill 1182 is nicknamed the Jetson Bill, makes flying cars legal in.
[02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:04.140]   Did you indicate down?
[02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:05.140]   Did you indicate down or left?
[02:34:05.140 --> 02:34:08.140]   I meant to indicate left, but I indicate down.
[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:12.460]   All right, kids, I think we've had enough for the day.
[02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:17.700]   You've proven that long form broadcasting has a future.
[02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:20.100]   The five people are still listening.
[02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:22.700]   Well done.
[02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:24.740]   You have stamina.
[02:34:24.740 --> 02:34:27.740]   That's Father Robert Ballis here, the digital Jesuit.
[02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:30.140]   Bobby, tell us what you're up to.
[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:34.340]   I know you brought back Padre's corner, right?
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:41.700]   I did, unfortunately when the pandemic started, suddenly my services were required a lot.
[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:42.700]   Oh.
[02:34:42.700 --> 02:34:46.220]   That's why my studio is no longer my studio because they realized what I built up here
[02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:49.060]   and they have used it pretty much every single day.
[02:34:49.060 --> 02:34:52.140]   For Zoom calls, nonstop Zoom calls.
[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.100]   Zoom calls, video messages.
[02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:58.020]   I mean, when you have an international organization that can no longer travel.
[02:34:58.020 --> 02:34:59.020]   That's really good.
[02:34:59.020 --> 02:35:00.460]   You built that though.
[02:35:00.460 --> 02:35:02.260]   You know what?
[02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:03.820]   Isn't that great?
[02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:05.180]   It is, it is.
[02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:06.340]   And now they know it's here.
[02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:10.700]   It means I have to build, I have to find another secret room and build something in there.
[02:35:10.700 --> 02:35:12.260]   Another secret room.
[02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:13.260]   Another one.
[02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:15.860]   It's an endless, endless chain.
[02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:17.060]   He has a discourse channel.
[02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:20.740]   If you want to play the Vatican Minecraft server, that's still up, right?
[02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:21.740]   Yes.
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:22.740]   We still play.
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:26.180]   Actually, just if you go to twitter.com/padreastj, you'll find everything.
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:28.020]   I link up the discord channel.
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:33.300]   I link up the servers for Minecraft, for Rust, for Don't Starve.
[02:35:33.300 --> 02:35:38.180]   Yep, I do play games far more than I should.
[02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:44.100]   And I hope that doesn't make it back to the people who tell me what to do.
[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:45.100]   It won't.
[02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:46.500]   Nobody watches this show.
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:49.220]   They were, but they stopped after the first half hour.
[02:35:49.220 --> 02:35:51.860]   Thank you, Father Robert Ballasier, the digital Jesuit.
[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:52.860]   Always a pleasure.
[02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:56.060]   I miss you so much, but I am glad you're doing God's work.
[02:35:56.060 --> 02:35:57.060]   Thank you for that.
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:35:58.820]   I wish I was back in California, Leo.
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:35:59.900]   Yeah.
[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:03.140]   The pasta's better here, believe it or not.
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:05.340]   And the eggs, the morning eggs.
[02:36:05.340 --> 02:36:06.340]   Much better.
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:07.900]   Much, much better.
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:08.900]   The poor guy.
[02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:11.540]   I feel free every time you post those pictures.
[02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:16.580]   Lexi Saviti's, thank you for introducing me to the Jaffal.
[02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:22.420]   Yes, if there's one thing that we can take from today's discussion, it is the Jaffal,
[02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:23.980]   and please go forth and conquer.
[02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:27.420]   I want to see all of the crazy concoctions that you make.
[02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:34.980]   My hot tip is, yeah, well, my secret guilty pleasure is tinged spaghetti in the Jaffal
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:36.340]   with a bit of cheese.
[02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:39.300]   Do you put bread in there or you just fry the spaghetti?
[02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:41.940]   No, you put it in the middle of the bread.
[02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:43.260]   Oh, you put it in the middle of the bread.
[02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:46.580]   It's a grilled cheese, but instead of cheese, it's tin spaghetti.
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:47.740]   But cheese and tin spaghetti.
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:48.740]   And cheese.
[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:52.300]   But maybe the tin spaghetti here is not as good as the one from my childhood.
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:53.300]   Oh, oh, no, no, no.
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:55.100]   We have Chef Boyardee here.
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:56.100]   Oh, stop.
[02:36:56.100 --> 02:36:57.100]   That's the towel.
[02:36:57.100 --> 02:36:58.100]   It's horrible.
[02:36:58.100 --> 02:36:59.100]   How about beefaroni?
[02:36:59.100 --> 02:37:02.100]   I bet beefaroni would be good in the Jaffal.
[02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:03.100]   Yeah, come on, give it a go.
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:04.100]   I want to get out on the next after hours.
[02:37:04.100 --> 02:37:06.100]   So that's the next cooking challenge, I think.
[02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:17.540]   We should explain to Jaffal is a grilled cheese maker, but it seals the edges so that the
[02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:20.540]   cheese, the gooey cheese, it becomes a hot pocket, basically.
[02:37:20.540 --> 02:37:21.540]   Hot pocket.
[02:37:21.540 --> 02:37:22.540]   It's a free penny.
[02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:23.540]   It's a free penny.
[02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:26.060]   You got to buy it.
[02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:30.540]   I expect next time to see the Jaffal maker take pride of place behind you.
[02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:33.540]   I think we should have a show on pandemic cuisine.
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:36.300]   Yeah, let's do it.
[02:37:36.300 --> 02:37:37.300]   I'm down.
[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:42.100]   All the amazing tools and things that you can use in quarantine.
[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:43.460]   Amazing.
[02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:46.620]   We can find her with Lexi Savides on CNET.
[02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:48.100]   Watch her videos.
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:54.940]   Lexi Savides on the Twitter and Instagram, L-E-X-Y-S-A-W-I-D-E-S.
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:57.660]   You are a gift.
[02:37:57.660 --> 02:37:58.660]   Thank you for being here.
[02:37:58.660 --> 02:37:59.660]   I really appreciate it.
[02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:00.660]   Thank you.
[02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:01.660]   Very kind.
[02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:02.660]   Thank you so much.
[02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:03.660]   Oh, no, it's my pleasure.
[02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:04.660]   Thank you for being here.
[02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:09.540]   And of course, Renee Ritchie, who is the gift that keeps on giving every Tuesday on
[02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:15.780]   MacBreak Weekly and of course on his YouTube channel, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:18.780]   This was fun to have three of my favorite people on today.
[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:20.500]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:22.700]   I'll see you Tuesday, Renee.
[02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:24.820]   And you guys, well, I'll see you next Sunday.
[02:38:24.820 --> 02:38:28.060]   We do a tweet every Sunday afternoon, about 230 Pacific.
[02:38:28.060 --> 02:38:29.620]   That's 530 Eastern.
[02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:31.780]   There's 2130 UTC.
[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:33.140]   There is a live stream.
[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:35.900]   It's just a making of behind the scenes thing.
[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:39.380]   That's in fact, you would know about the Jaffal maker if you tuned in early because that
[02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:41.540]   was all before the show began.
[02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:44.540]   Twitter.tv/live, there's live audio and video.
[02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:45.900]   A little programming note.
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:49.780]   We have moved the audio server.
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:50.980]   We're doing a redirect.
[02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:53.060]   Most people should not know.
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:54.540]   Notice the difference.
[02:38:54.540 --> 02:39:01.100]   But if you're having a little trouble with your VLC or whatever you've streamed the audio
[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:03.060]   with before, that's why.
[02:39:03.060 --> 02:39:07.060]   Go to twit.tv/live to link it up again.
[02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:08.060]   The links are there.
[02:39:08.060 --> 02:39:10.380]   Twit.tv/live.
[02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:14.420]   On-demand versions of the show at their website, twit.tv.
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:19.940]   Of course, it takes a couple hours after the show's done to whip it into shape.
[02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:23.460]   But we have a Jaffal maker for that now, which will make it a lot easier just trim any
[02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:25.900]   edges and everything will be done.
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:31.220]   Twit.tv is the website and on-demand, of course, on YouTube from your Amazon Echo or
[02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:32.380]   other voice assistant.
[02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:34.740]   You just ask for this week in tech.
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:36.460]   Podcast, it'll play for you.
[02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:40.340]   The easiest thing to do would be find a podcast application, pocket casts, or shout-kicks.
[02:39:40.340 --> 02:39:45.820]   Podcast, or Spotify, or I go on Google or Apple's podcast app and subscribe.
[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:48.820]   That way you get it automatically.
[02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:50.900]   We like to say your...
[02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:51.900]   What is it?
