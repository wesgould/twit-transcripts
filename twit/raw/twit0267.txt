[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.400]   news, joining us in studio today.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.800]   I'm very pleased to say Veronica Belmont.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.320]   Hello.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.840]   A core and techzilla.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   Hello, Veronica.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.600]   Thank you for having us.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.520]   And thank you for the wine.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.720]   And sword and laser.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.040]   Sword and laser.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.440]   And what else do you need?
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.120]   Credit for.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.080]   Oh, that's about it right now, I think.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.920]   I got pretty much everybody at Buzz Out Loud work
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.240]   in here except you and Molly.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.280]   We're working on you.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.640]   I'm very excited for Jason.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.840]   Yeah, we're thrilled to get Jason.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.600]   He starts tomorrow.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.440]   He's a great guy.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.040]   He's extremely talented.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.880]   And I think he's going to be a huge addition to the team.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.640]   Love Jason.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.840]   Jason, we're talking about Jason Howell.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.640]   Yes.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.760]   Not Thurston Hall.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.960]   Not Thurston Hall.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.240]   You'll be here later.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.200]   That's Ryan Block.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.720]   Hello, Ryan.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.000]   Good to see you from gadget.com.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.400]   Thank you.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.240]   And about.me/rionblock.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.760]   Yes.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.640]   This is the new hipster thing to do.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.000]   You have this web calling card.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.120]   You got one too, Veronica.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.520]   I do.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.040]   It's more like a splash page.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.640]   It's like a dedicated home page for all your stuff.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   Ryan and I are both advisors for the site.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.080]   Ah, yes.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.520]   There's so much disclosure that needs to go on here.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.240]   I know these days.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.520]   Are you investors or just advisors?
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.080]   Just advisors.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.320]   No, but they-- so Tony Conrad, who's one of the co-founders,
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.640]   is an investor in my company.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.600]   He's on my board.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.520]   Oh, cool.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.880]   But it's still a great product.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.320]   Even despite the fact that I'm, I guess, legally obligated.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.200]   No, I always want you to say if you're on the board
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.360]   or something that, yeah, I'm on the board of that.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.560]   No, yes, he's on my board.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.720]   But no, about time he's awesome.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.680]   Also, here Cara Swisher from her apartment.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.880]   It looks like somebody's licked the camera
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.440]   with peanut butter tongues.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.560]   Yeah, I'm going to get-- there you go.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.960]   There.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.480]   Sorry.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.360]   I have a better one.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.120]   I just don't have time to stop.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.600]   That's fine.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.400]   That's fine.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.520]   Allthingsd.com.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.600]   Great to see you again, Cara.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.200]   Hey.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.700]   Hey.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.800]   It's from the cottage where all things digital
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.920]   has its headquarters.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.360]   That's it, right there.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.800]   Indeed.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.160]   The digital cottage.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.400]   So boy, there's a lot to talk about this week.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.040]   But I guess we should start with Mike Arrington and Angel
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.520]   Gate.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.440]   Oh, boy, huh?
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.760]   This week, Mike published a story about not being invited
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.960]   to a party.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.400]   And actually, the title of the story
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.320]   was I thought pretty good.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.480]   It was.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.900]   So a blogger walks into a bar?
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.580]   So a blogger walks into a bar.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.300]   The restaurant been 38, actually.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.820]   Not exactly.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.740]   A bar pretty fine.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.260]   So a wine bar, yeah.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.860]   It's a wine bar.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.360]   OK.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.940]   I haven't been there.
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.220]   I'm not that hip.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.900]   I haven't been there either.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.220]   Have you been there, Ryan?
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.220]   I was at that meeting.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.540]   Yes.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.980]   OK.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.660]   Well, there you go.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.980]   Now we know he's an angel.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.660]   So apparently, Mike gets a tip that--
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.740]   and this is all-- this is the story as Mike tells it.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.380]   Mike gets a tip that a bunch of super angels
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.820]   are going to meet.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.900]   What's a super angel, Cara?
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.260]   I don't know what--
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.560]   a super-- there's Mike right here.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.160]   Tell us, Mike.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   Hi, Mike.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.400]   Share with us.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.840]   Lauren Feldman's mic pop up.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.520]   I can't put my hand up his butt.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.020]   Oh!
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.680]   Just can't bring yourself to do that, huh?
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.040]   You can get myself to do that.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.720]   It's super angel.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's just people-- angels who are slightly smaller than VCs.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.920]   I mean, some of them have $30 to $40 million.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.960]   So it's extensive amounts of money.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.120]   You know, I was actually talking about this on Twitter
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.200]   the other day.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.160]   Can we just make a pact, I guess, not to use this term anymore?
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.080]   Super angel?
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.920]   I mean, I think there's kind of--
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.420]   Is it a meaningless word?
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.980]   Well, so there's kinds of--
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.420]   and this is-- let the insider baseball begin,
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.300]   because this is all investment world stuff.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.820]   You know, I didn't even talk about this story
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.060]   on my radio show, because nobody in the real world
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.020]   could care less about.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.700]   Mike Arrington, TechCrunch, Super Angels, Ron Conway,
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.580]   bin 38.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.580]   It is totally just by default--
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.060]   by definition inside baseball.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.540]   But go ahead.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.860]   Yes.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.780]   Let's move on then.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.860]   Oh, we got to do the story.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.380]   Because--
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.300]   Well, this is--
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.620]   Why?
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.980]   No, I mean, seriously.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.060]   This is just bull--
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.980]   It's just like-- it's so insider.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.280]   There's words you could use since I live in the Castro.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.080]   But it's just not--
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.380]   look, today they brought a post saying it may or may not
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.000]   have been actually anything happening.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.880]   And I think it's just--
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.360]   So he said there was a party there.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.900]   He went.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.520]   I can't believe it.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.520]   He goes to the party.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.400]   Even though he's told that you're not going to be invited,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.040]   there's nine people.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.600]   He says, I'm good friends with all of them.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.560]   He walks in and says, hey, here's where you buy me a beer.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.160]   They say nothing according to him.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.520]   He walks out.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.360]   Well, here's where the problem is.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.760]   He's good friends.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.000]   I mean, why is he good friends with people he covers?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.720]   You know.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.240]   Well, that is it.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.040]   That's problem one.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.660]   That's a good point.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.100]   And secondly, it's not name.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.020]   The people aren't named.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.940]   So if he's going to allege all this collusion
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.100]   and very serious, make serious allegations,
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.820]   then be a reporter and put the names down.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.900]   Why aren't the names there?
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.980]   And then it's just--
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.940]   It's interesting because he was--
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.980]   Dave McClure, who says he was there--
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.300]   500 hats, says, first of all, no collusion.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.460]   We're just shooting the breeze.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.460]   It's right.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.940]   And this is typical BS.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.940]   Henry Blodget, who has maybe a checkered past as a reporter--
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.380]   Let's take Henry Blodget to work before.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.580]   I don't know what things will be perfect.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.640]   This says, this is great reporting.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.160]   Some people think this is what a blogger/reporter should do.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.140]   This is journalistic enterprise.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.960]   Cara, you obviously don't feel that way.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.360]   I'd like to see some follow-up then.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.680]   OK.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   Who are the people there?
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.800]   Did they actually collude?
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.080]   Let's do some very serious reporting and set it.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.160]   I'll scratch your back.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.760]   You scratch mine.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.360]   It's purely an allegation.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.960]   They're all appearing at the same conference tomorrow.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.440]   They're all like best friends now.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.800]   They all keep publishing each other's emails back and forth.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.480]   It's so insider as to be--
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.540]   I don't know how deep-- it's just--
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.060]   I don't know.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.620]   And I have a question for all you guys.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.780]   Since I'm not really up to date on all this kind of stuff,
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.380]   it's not really an area I usually pay a lot of attention to.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.260]   But my question, I guess, for either Cara or Ryan or Leo
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.780]   would be, is this something that's always
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.820]   kind of assumed to be going on anyway?
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.820]   No, it's highly illegal.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.420]   I understand that it's illegal.
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.140]   But do people just assume that this activity goes on behind
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.020]   the scenes all the time?
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.540]   There's a fine line.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.100]   Investors talk, entrepreneurs talk, everybody talks.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.540]   Because you have to kind of understand
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.580]   what's going on and what's happening in the market.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.440]   But if the conversation gets to very specific pricing
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.880]   and terms around very specific deals with specific people,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.480]   that's when it can cross over.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.840]   Or as Mike alleged, where they're saying,
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.920]   we're going to keep the valuations low, so we make more money.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.700]   And we're going to ace Paul Graham and why
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.720]   commentator out because he's doing too well.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.320]   All allegations, all unfounded, you're right, Cara.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.200]   And I guess--
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.560]   Let's do some serious reporting.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.320]   Today, they go, oh, well, let's just leave it behind.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.020]   Did I read that for a second?
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.540]   So Cara, what I'm curious about is,
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.940]   obviously, you're very, very much in this sphere of reporting.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.180]   I'm not so much in the reporting world anymore.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.580]   But if I was, I'd be in the gadget side of things.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.740]   And not so much here.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.800]   You're doing an excellent job.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.380]   So thank you.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.260]   But no, this is absolutely your world.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.460]   So what have you heard?
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.420]   I just think it's a good people.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.020]   I know that you probably done some follow-up reporting.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.220]   I have done some follow-up reporting.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.740]   And it just seems like it was very similar to the national
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.240]   Senate, when the VCs get together for their annual things.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.960]   It sounds like a group bitching and moaning.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.840]   It does not sound like a colluding--
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.120]   that's what it sounds like to me.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.220]   It sounds like a group of people that got together
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.560]   were bitching and moaning about various things.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.080]   And again, did you see Ron Conway's letter about it?
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.580]   I did.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.440]   Yeah, and then his follow-up letter as well.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.080]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.240]   I see all those things.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.040]   Yeah, he published that one this afternoon.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.280]   OK, so tell us what he said.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.840]   We're ignorant.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.440]   We're ignorant.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.280]   I'm so sorry.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.520]   I'm so sorry for doing this.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.060]   Why don't you throw out the original Ron Conway letter,
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.580]   and then I will throw out the follow-up.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.820]   And then I'll also disclose that Ron Conway's an investor
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.740]   my company.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.420]   Yeah, OK.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.140]   So actually, that's why you're kind of an interesting person
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.140]   to talk to on this, Ryan, because you've had to go out
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.980]   and deal with these people.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.580]   Yeah, I know probably at least a couple of people
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.380]   who are at that meeting or have had meetings with those people.
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.020]   And I'm sure that at least one, if not more--
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.420]   Well, that's the GDGT.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.300]   Yeah, SV Angel is in my company.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.100]   I don't know for sure who else is there,
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.600]   but I have a feeling that there's probably at least one
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.760]   other person there who, if they're not in my company,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.520]   we've talked them and almost had them in our company.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:09.880]   So--
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.920]   Do you worry as an entrepreneur that they
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.840]   might be doing this to screw you?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.880]   Well, like I said, I mean, investors talk,
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.800]   and that's a given, an entrepreneur's talk,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.840]   and that's a given.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.040]   It's really-- I mean, at least in my particular experience,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.080]   and I've worked with some really amazing investors
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.600]   who I admire greatly.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.180]   And there's nobody in our round, or both of our rounds,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.880]   of funding that we raised that I feel
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.400]   would ever have done something like that.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.720]   But if there was ever that sense,
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.340]   I would have walked away from the deal.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.480]   But it can be hard.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.440]   If it's going on in backroom conversations,
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.720]   it's hard to know for sure.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.280]   Or in public line bars.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.120]   Public line.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.120]   I was telling--
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   That's so--
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.760]   It sounds like a very typical gathering.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.600]   These people bitch and moan about various things.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.200]   First of all, there's a million VCs out there right now,
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.360]   competing for some very hot deals.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.160]   So first of all, even if these people colluded,
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.000]   if they have-- and I'd like to know if they did,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.520]   if TechCrunch is alleging this, they're going to allege it.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.200]   I'd like to see a follow up on it.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.640]   But if they were, in fact, just bitching about it,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.160]   I just don't think it's very hard to collude in this industry
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.720]   given there's VCs, there's super VCs, there's angel investors,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.560]   there's just minor regular people investors,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.600]   which they're numerous.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.960]   I'd like to know what they actually
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.960]   planned on doing an organized fashion.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.360]   OK, so I don't think we've actually given any context
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.120]   as to what's going on here.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.880]   I think we've just assumed everybody knows what's going on.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.240]   So OK, first, you got these super angels.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.920]   That is a term I find to be very weird,
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.960]   because it's basically in the investment world,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.760]   you have two kinds of investors, you have VCs,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.640]   and you have angels.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.920]   VCs raise a fund from a variety of sources.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.480]   They collect tens of millions of dollars,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.560]   and then they invest that money.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.280]   And they get paid on management fees and on carry,
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.240]   which means that if they sell a company,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.160]   they get a percentage of that sale,
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.800]   in addition to the management fee of actually being the VC
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.160]   and holding that cash.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.040]   And angel is someone who invests their own money, personally.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.920]   You have $1 million in the bank or whatever,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.640]   and you dole that out, however you please.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.480]   This term super angels, I think, come up
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   for really high profile angel investors, some of whom
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.720]   have actually gone out and raised a $10 million fund
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.000]   or $20 million fund.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.320]   And who kind of-- I mean, I think at that point, you're a VC.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.200]   If you've raised a fund, you're not an angel.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.560]   If you're not investing your own money,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.200]   you're investing somebody else's money, you're not an angel.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.000]   Angel means, does my money?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.280]   VC means it's a bunch of people's money.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.880]   Yes, got it.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.960]   So exactly.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.680]   Yeah, not your money.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.760]   But you are paid in order to invest that money.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.480]   So do these super angels have funds,
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.600]   or are they all investing just their own money?
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.880]   Well, the term super angel, I think,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.160]   has come to encompass both high profile angels,
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.800]   as well as these angels with funds.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.200]   So angels who are not investing their own money anymore.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   So Dave McClure is one of these guys.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.720]   I think a lot of the people who are at that meeting
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.400]   have raised funds.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.120]   Ron Conway is someone who was a very prolific angel investor.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.840]   And now he's got a fund and he's operating with funds.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.480]   So who's responded to these allegations?
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.760]   Dave McClure said BS.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.440]   I was there.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.200]   Nothing.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.880]   Did Ron Conway respond?
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.960]   Yes, he wrote it.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.480]   He wasn't there.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.120]   His partner was there--
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.680]   has gone twice to these dinners, by the way.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.200]   FYI.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.600]   It seems to me if you're going to collude,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.240]   you don't have it in a public place.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.480]   You were right, Veronica.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.920]   That's something that just kind of busted me
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.680]   about the whole thing.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.640]   You have it in the back room of somewhere no one can see you.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.560]   In a private office.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.480]   You don't have it somewhere where Mike Errington can walk in
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.840]   and ask for a beer.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.960]   Well, I mean, Ron just wrote this sort of angry Ron note.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.440]   I've gotten one myself in my life,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.640]   so I've seen them before.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.200]   But where he was like, hold here then now,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.080]   towards all him, except, oh, by the way,
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.960]   Dave Lee was there too, who was one of their partners.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.760]   So I don't know.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.240]   I think it's just one of these tempest in a teapot
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.760]   that if there is something there,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.960]   I'm curious why there isn't a follow-up.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.640]   And secondly, why are all these people
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.080]   on a panel at a conference together?
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.480]   Do you think this is to promote tech disrupt?
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.160]   I don't know.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.240]   What do you think?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.280]   I don't know.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:11.680]   I don't know.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.640]   I mean, it calls--
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.240]   it is a very serious allegation.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.880]   It calls to any people's credibility and questions.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.560]   It's a crappy thing to say if all you're doing
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.040]   is really promoting that you're having an event.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.840]   And the people who are on that panel
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.120]   have nothing to benefit by being subject to this rumor.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.560]   No.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.040]   Dave McClure is not going to have his reputation bolstered
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.960]   by being part of this.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.880]   Yeah, it's smoother.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.880]   Even if it's not.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.440]   Even if it's--
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.280]   I mean, when did you show her it's not on her life?
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.520]   It's a hard--
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.440]   That's what Dave said.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.280]   That's what Dave said in his title.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.400]   I mean, the thing is, tomorrow they'll all be pals.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.000]   That's the thing.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.080]   That's the horrible thing about this whole thing,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.120]   is that tomorrow-- this is whole circus.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.000]   Mike is an angel himself, isn't he?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.880]   Well, I don't know.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.840]   No, not anymore.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.920]   He says he divested all investors.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.040]   Yeah, he announced a couple of years ago
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.440]   that he was getting out of the angel.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.760]   But the fact of the matter is tomorrow,
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.680]   they'll all be paling around and leaking each other
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.080]   information and scratching each other's back.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.720]   So the whole thing is a ridiculous worldwide wrestling.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.560]   On everybody's part.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.000]   So it's manipulative.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.760]   I don't know what it is.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.360]   I don't know why they do it.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.240]   It feels like a worldwide--
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.120]   Let's talk another about another tech crunch story.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.160]   The Facebook phone.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.200]   So now you think this is your field.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.520]   So let me ask you, Ron, is that correct?
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.160]   Before we move on, Angel.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.360]   I do just want to say one thing.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.800]   And that is that Veronica's like, oh, kill me.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.040]   No, I do think--
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.880]   Do you guys talk about this over breakfast?
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.440]   Is this like--
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:33.940]   Yes.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.600]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.880]   Yeah, we don't.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.040]   We did today.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   You were prepping for the show.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.800]   No, usually.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.080]   I mean, the thing about this--
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.280]   and the reason why this is such a contentious story,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.000]   I think, whether it's true or not, is--
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.040]   I think there are two things.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.360]   But the primary bit is basically that these kinds
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.920]   of conversations can, in a moment and without even
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.320]   intentionally going that direction,
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.200]   can instantaneously become borderline illegal
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.280]   in terms of this kinds of--
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.240]   I mean, there's sitting out, sitting down
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.600]   with a group of nefarious, ancient investors
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.400]   and saying we're going to collude.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.560]   I don't really think that's what happened.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.560]   But if you get a bunch of people together
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.680]   and you do start talking very specific things
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.440]   about very specific deals, that can, if not be illegal,
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.880]   it can be highly unethical.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.760]   If it just goes just the wrong way.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.040]   And it's very easy, I think, for this conversation
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.200]   to happen that way.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.520]   So it's possible that maybe that's where the story came from.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.160]   And then it kind of started to sound like people
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   tried to distance themselves from it.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160]   My god, this could be taken way wrong.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.000]   Is it true that Mike represents a kind of journalist,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.040]   a blogger journalist who, in the old days of New York Times,
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.720]   Washington Post, all the president's men,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.200]   you had to have two sources before you went with the story.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.880]   So he clicked--
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.380]   Mike--
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.380]   Mike--
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.220]   Mike resources here.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.060]   He says he had three--
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:00.880]   OK.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.880]   He said immediately after that meeting,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.560]   two people who he saw there called him.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.760]   And then he called us a third.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.680]   Oh, you're right there.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.640]   And he said--
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.640]   They're all just--
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.800]   It's wrestling.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.320]   It's friends.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.280]   It's friends.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.720]   Hey, you know what he did.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.480]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.960]   I mean, I think--
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.280]   I don't think that Mike would have published this
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.720]   without serious consideration, because even if it is really
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.600]   good for disrupt-- and I mean, obviously,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.360]   I think there's a lot of accusations
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.200]   you can make about those kinds of relationships and stuff.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.120]   It's not doing anybody any good.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.040]   Mike is not going to make his friendships with any of these
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.160]   people better by having reported this.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.800]   Just for people who don't know, disrupt
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.000]   is Mike's kind of version of the demo conference
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.720]   where entrepreneurs come to demo their new ideas
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.880]   in hopes of raising money from these very same angels.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.080]   That was TechCrunch 50.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.920]   The strap is now--
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.680]   This is not the same?
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.760]   There is that element in disrupt, but disrupt, I think,
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.560]   is more--
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.280]   it's half that, half panels, fireside chats, executive
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.040]   discussions.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.760]   What it is about bringing entrepreneurs and investors
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.160]   together?
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.440]   That is a big element of it.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.520]   I mean, it's a little bit like Keras Conference,
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.720]   which is amazing.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.720]   And she does the industry--
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.920]   The De-conference.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.440]   Yes.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.160]   Yeah, that is the industry event.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.560]   But his is a little bit more, I think, startup-centric.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.040]   OK.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.560]   Yeah, it's different.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.760]   And it's next week, too.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.400]   Yeah, it's a very good conference.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.040]   It's very well done.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.080]   Your conference, yes, it is very good.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:31.600]   Are you going to go for it?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.080]   Are you going to go?
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.840]   I'm on a tech conference.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.200]   It's good.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.520]   I used to be called TechCrunch 50.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.240]   It was very good when it was done there for startups.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:37.680]   So how about you?
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.960]   Especially it's focused on startups.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.520]   Are you guys both going to disrupt?
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.240]   Yeah, I'm going to try to stop by for a bit.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.440]   Keri, you're going?
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.480]   Yeah, I think John is going.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.280]   Patchy, OK.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.760]   OK.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.080]   So how about that Google China situation, huh?
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.640]   What's the latest with Google in China?
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.400]   I didn't even see.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.840]   Apparently, China has been spying on our Googles.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.360]   Oh, no.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.840]   Our Gmail is spying on our Googles.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.320]   Spying on our Googles.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.520]   Yeah, in fact, some people are getting banners, big red,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.840]   appropriately colored banners.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.520]   I posted about this on Buzz, and I
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.920]   got a lot of responses from people
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.560]   who had seen that on their Gmail.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.040]   It says, what does it say on the banner?
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.800]   It says that there is a possibility
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.160]   that there has been an intrusion on your Gmail by Chinese.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.920]   The Chinese might be looking at your mail.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.880]   Which, wouldn't you just kind of freak out a little bit
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.800]   if you saw that?
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.360]   I would.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.880]   I didn't get that luckily.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.400]   But then there are people who are encouraged to change
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.760]   their passwords and kind of make sure
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.560]   that they have everything in order and see what's in.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.120]   You know what I think would be a wise decision,
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.600]   is especially considering the situation is not new and related
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.200]   specifically to China, is to basically put a policy
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.400]   in a place where if you're going to China,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.160]   then you need to check a little box that says,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.400]   I'm going to be accessing my email soon from China.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.920]   And then otherwise just come to the block.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   But I don't--
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.560]   Where the people were not in China.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.800]   Because the people you were talking to that said they saw
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.000]   this, Veronica, they weren't--
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.280]   No, they were stateside.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.760]   It was somebody from China.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.200]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.640]   Because Google keeps IP logs--
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.240]   I love that at the bottom of Gmail.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.880]   You will get in a notice that says somebody from this weird IP
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.960]   was accessing.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.800]   This is just a big, annoying, scary version of that.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.240]   Exactly.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.560]   So Google keeps IP logs of all accesses of your account,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.120]   so you can see if anything weird or untoward is going on.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.040]   And if you're a US user, you should not
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.040]   be able to access your account from a Chinese IP address.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.800]   From a Chinese IP, gotcha.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.880]   Unless you explicitly state, I am going to China.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.360]   Please unlock this for Chinese.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.840]   So they would block all Chinese access to your Google
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   unless it was due.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.800]   At this point, there is absolutely no reason why anyone
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.920]   from China should be able to even attempt
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.000]   to access my email address, especially knowing
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.920]   what we know now about these intrusions.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.280]   They need to lock that off.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:37.800]   That's a good idea.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   That's pretty scary.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.360]   They need to lock it off.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.600]   Well, I mean, Google's been having a hard time lately
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.720]   with privacy intrusions in general.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.120]   So that doesn't really inspire a lot of confidence
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.720]   that they can't prevent this kind of thing from happening.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.840]   Says, warning.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.200]   Warning, Will Robinson.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.880]   We believe your account was recently
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.320]   accessed from China.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.120]   If it said, warning Will Robinson,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.400]   that would be so much better.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.040]   If it actually said that.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.640]   People would go, who says Will Robinson?
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.640]   That's not me.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.200]   Danger.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.400]   Danger, Will Robinson.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   Danger.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.000]   Chinese are reading your email.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   That's a strange thing for Google to do.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.080]   I mean, would they do that if Romanian--
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.920]   Warning, somebody from Romania just said--
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   I think it's very specific to their issues with China.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.440]   That's what I think.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.640]   And the Chinese government in general.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.120]   It seems like it's a little bit like, OK, China.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.120]   Take this.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.200]   They're putting a big, big red spotlight
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.680]   right on the issue, which I think is important.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.080]   But I don't think they would do that
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.320]   if they were getting IP intrusions from anywhere else.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.960]   Well, I think that Chinese intrusions are quite active
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.240]   and regular, and it's a major country.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.200]   And it's, you know, Romania isn't quite--
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.400]   we're not quite as worried about what Romania has.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.920]   Well, we're just seeing that as an example.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.280]   But what I'm saying is I think Canada is invading your email.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.560]   Canada, yeah, I don't want that banner on it.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.120]   Any country with state-controlled net access.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.600]   Look, here's a--
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.480]   Probably you want to--
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.280]   Here's a Chinese web page with your picture on it.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.920]   Oh, great.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.640]   Look at that.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.120]   You see, warning.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.120]   They're collecting-- no, that's I don't know.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   That's my staking.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.320]   We're a naked shot.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.800]   I'm not actually making that picture.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   I don't do top, yeah.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.640]   I understand.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.120]   The Bowie brothers, they do good work.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.080]   They do.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.840]   That's your story anyway.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.440]   I've seen a lot of those.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.320]   That's a story I've come up with, yes.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.000]   Be very careful.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.440]   I worked with a woman who had nude pictures taken of her,
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.000]   and then cropped it from here.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.920]   I'm familiar with that story.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.000]   We all know who this person is.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.600]   Yeah, we all need to.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.440]   And she used that picture, cropped,
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.880]   but she didn't realize that Photoshop
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.720]   maintained a thumbnail of the full image.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.160]   And of course, they leaked down onto the internet.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.880]   Not cool.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   Yeah, that's awful.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.560]   Poor girl.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.320]   We're snamer.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   Yeah, really a bad idea.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.360]   So don't get naked pictures taken of you.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.960]   I have many, and so far, nobody's released them.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.520]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.040]   That's weird.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:46.960]   They're fantastic.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.800]   Oh, we've all seen them.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.240]   You really are.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.760]   Really?
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.320]   They're very artistically done.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.040]   Artistic.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.880]   That's what I appreciate about these.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.760]   You really, your inner light comes through in those pictures.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.400]   The shine's right into the camera.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.240]   Zynga.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:00.600]   Can I have some more wine?
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.040]   Yeah, please.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.680]   After that, you deserve some more wine.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.000]   You have to have mental image.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.240]   I reward putting up with that.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.760]   Let's talk about Zynga a little bit.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.880]   Zynga just rented the building that Tech TV used to be.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.000]   Oh, really?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.120]   Not only do they rent it, they rented the whole thing.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.200]   I think several hundred thousand square feet.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.000]   So that's down in the paturo, right?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   It's the towns in the building, which has been--
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.400]   this far as to my knowledge vacant since we left it.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.880]   Yeah, I think that's been the area that Mark Owens
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.320]   is building in the area that he's kept Zynga in.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.960]   And now this is just nearby it.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.320]   It's right next door to Adobe.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.400]   Adobe's down there as well.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:41.680]   Yeah, right.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.600]   It's absolutely right on that-- there's a circle there.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.720]   But Mark has been located sort of nearby for a long time.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   200--
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.880]   He owns several buildings.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.680]   270,000 square feet.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.320]   No, I have to say, I was really not
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.600]   happy with the recent mafia wars promotion.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.800]   Did you talk about that on the show?
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.440]   No, what happened?
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:58.720]   I need to see that.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.080]   I know how they were like--
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.560]   The gluing dollar bills to the sidewalk.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.000]   The bills with the mafia image on them, all over the sidewalk.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.840]   In San Francisco?
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.920]   Yeah, everywhere.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.080]   Is that even legal?
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.040]   No, the city is actually suing them for the cost of the--
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.000]   It's also defacing government-- the bills,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.720]   you're not supposed to do that either.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.960]   Like really, mafia wars needs more promotion.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.000]   I don't think so.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.520]   Can't your money be spent somewhere else, I mean?
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.400]   It's working for them.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.200]   Zynga--
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.280]   Clearly, it's working for them, because we're
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.760]   talking about it right now on split.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.360]   Go, curses!
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.200]   They win again.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.720]   Foil.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.400]   I don't let myself be--
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.240]   frequently, like this "Arington" article,
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.560]   you would like to just bury the story and not report it.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.400]   But I don't let that-- because you
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.520]   got to report what's going on.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.360]   You can't let--
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.640]   Yeah, and I love that knee-jerk reaction free publicity.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.160]   No.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.000]   That is actually not accurate.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.720]   And the whole concept that any press is good press--
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.120]   so not true.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.960]   So we're giving them bad press?
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.660]   So they're getting bad press.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.400]   Screw using for literally my sidewalks.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.040]   It's not hurting.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   Zynga, which does Farmville, Yo-Ville, mafia wars,
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.520]   bunch of other Facebook programs.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.880]   Oh, I have been known to play the Farmville.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.480]   I played the Farmville.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.360]   I had to actually go cold turkey on Farmville.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.160]   So I would--
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.520]   But I'm glad that Veronica quit.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.520]   She had withdrawals.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.600]   You're playing a lot?
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.400]   Do you see it was--
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.600]   Well, then I found it when it came out on the iPhone.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.500]   I got back in total.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.200]   I haven't told you.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.640]   No, I've seen you playing it.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.760]   Oh, it's so sad when couples discover these.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.920]   You can't keep anything from me.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.560]   My wife gets mad because I play We Rule at the Breakfast
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:29.860]   Table.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.540]   That's not good.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.060]   No, that's not good.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.180]   Not appropriate.
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.340]   Office debut on Thursday.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.900]   The intern?
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.620]   I'd like the little side thing, a little side nod to Farmville.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.580]   He's sitting at the computer.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.580]   He's saying, oh, I got to harvest my strawberries.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.020]   That's Farmville, right?
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.780]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:54.260]   They say they move one petabyte of data daily.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:59.920]   That's 1,000 terabytes of bandwidth a day.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.520]   A day.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.480]   They say they're buying 1,000 new servers a week.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.960]   This was a--
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.440]   Well, no wonder they're getting that giant office
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.480]   for all those tubes.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.960]   No wonder they can afford a school dollar bills
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.320]   to the sidewalk.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.520]   They're probably smoking.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.240]   They're probably lighting their cigars.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:13.800]   Mark--
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.600]   big business is lighting a cigars with $100 bills.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.120]   What was it?
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.800]   We'll see if they can keep it up.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.240]   You sound skeptical.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.280]   Well, they're buying out a lot of game developers
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.460]   all over the world.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.440]   They just bought a new German.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.220]   I think they bought a German game company that they are--
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.880]   --terminating this year.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.380]   Sweet.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.120]   Did everybody read that SFK8 article about--
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.620]   Yes.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:33.980]   What was it?
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.560]   It was--
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.740]   Farmvilleans.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.260]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.860]   Farmvilleans.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.360]   I missed that one.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:39.860]   I don't know.
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.180]   It seemed kind of poorly sourced, if you ask me.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.100]   I mean, there just--
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.580]   What's the thesis?
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.340]   It seemed to be enough.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.580]   Well, as you probably couldn't tell from the title--
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.860]   Well, this was an SFK.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:49.820]   This was SF Weekly.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.820]   This is the one where the--
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.740]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:57.080]   People were-- yeah, this was the former disgruntled former
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:57.800]   employee.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.200]   Yes, basically saying friends don't let friends work at Zinga
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.640]   and Zinga's an evil company.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.920]   And Zinga's the opposite of Google, which is do evil.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.360]   Interesting, of course, that Google is investing--
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.840]   The negative on Farmville--
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.040]   And I've said this before, is that it's not a good--
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.880]   Veronica, you're a gamer.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.360]   It's not a good game.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.480]   It's got a lot of parts to it that--
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   It's social compulsion.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.220]   Yeah, it's-- you get compelled to-- it's OCD.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.580]   Which I guess is one way to drag people back.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.240]   It works.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.140]   But I find myself not playing for weeks and weeks and weeks,
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.420]   and I don't really care.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.820]   Just some people get that compulsive behavior setting in,
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.820]   so they need to go back.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.020]   But this is where you get in trouble.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.940]   And this is, I think, what it's all built on is,
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.940]   if you start now cleaning somebody's farm like your mother
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.620]   or your sister, your best friend's farm,
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.620]   and they give you a pig, and you give them--
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.660]   Pretty soon, you can't pull out.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.520]   What it is is it's like the whole chore theory.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.120]   And a lot of games succumb to this.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.880]   People say this is a warcraft all the time,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.520]   where they're essentially playing a game.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.280]   Well, no, they're essentially playing a game
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.480]   where you're doing a bunch of chores all day.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.680]   Well, that's my problem with wow.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.640]   Fish fish fish fish fish fish.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.600]   Run run run fish fish fish fish.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.240]   Run run run.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.560]   There's other elements of the game,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.280]   but that's something that people kind of latch onto,
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.640]   and they give you that compulsive circle.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.080]   I've been playing the beta a little bit,
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.600]   but I've been a little too busy with--
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.200]   What the horde?
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   --two and four.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   Four the horde.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.120]   Four the horde.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.260]   A little too busy with StarCraft II and Civ V right now
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.260]   to get into that.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.540]   You don't play StarCraft II online, do you?
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.500]   I've been training with Tom occasionally, actually.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.340]   Training?
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.900]   We're not very good in multiplayer yet,
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.860]   so we're practicing against each other to try to--
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.300]   You can't compete.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.420]   No, I mean, people have been playing
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.140]   the original StarCraft for 10 years.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.380]   They've got it down, like, unbelievable--
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.540]   They know all the build orders are in there,
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.900]   and they're built into their synapses.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.660]   And why have things have changed a little bit
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.940]   in StarCraft II, not so much that this is going to affect
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.980]   their flow at all.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.760]   Some videos on YouTube, and I realized, no,
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.920]   I'm going to play the campaign by myself again today.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.000]   Oh, the campaign is great.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.500]   I mean--
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.440]   And that's all I'm going to do, because I can't play real people,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.260]   because they'll kill me.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.400]   It's really one of the better campaigns in a game.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.160]   I've been a long time.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.160]   I have a feeling Carav is over there rolling her eyes.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.600]   I'm a halo person.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.560]   Thank you.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.080]   I don't play.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.160]   I have children.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.280]   I don't play any games.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.160]   I am essentially a child at heart.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.660]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.720]   My kids play games, but not those games.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.800]   What games do they play?
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.640]   They're liddin'.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.580]   The way, the way, you know, like Lego Star Wars.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.580]   I don't know.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.580]   You're going to get a--
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.500]   You can tell them that I said they're not real gamers.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.820]   Are you going to get a move?
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.780]   Sony-- oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.700]   I have to--
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.820]   They're going to have the natal.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.060]   They'll play the natal when they get it.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.140]   I think Connect is awesome.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.580]   Now, I'm going to recuse you, because Amber does Amber.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.580]   Sorry.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.820]   Oh, here we go.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.180]   Someone quickly edit that before it hits the air.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.380]   No, he's called the Tonya.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.580]   I worked with a little name to Amber for many years on TV.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.700]   And I don't know why, but you remind me a little bit of her.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.600]   But Veronica-- I used to call her Victoria, so I'm actually
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   getting better.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   It's getting closer.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   I don't even know anybody.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.800]   Maybe one of these years is going to get it.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.600]   I just call her that girl.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   That lady.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   That lady over there.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   The lady over there.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.200]   And I forgot what I was going to say.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   Something-- all right, we're talking about--
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.080]   Oh, we're talking about-- you're going to recuse me,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   because I want to have some products.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.480]   I want to recuse you because you work for a Sony product called
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.440]   Core, so we won't ask you.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.120]   But isn't that move thing a piece of crap?
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.680]   Well, I mean, I think maybe I have to recuse myself
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.220]   because if I say yes, then--
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.060]   I think it's a piece of crap.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.060]   But I don't mind--
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.860]   They brought it up here.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.580]   Ben brought it up here from the San Francisco office.
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.500]   And I played a couple of games with it.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.540]   It's like the Wii, but you're attaching it
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.820]   to a like, hardcore game.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.260]   And it just does--
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.420]   I'm excited about Connect.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.820]   Well, what games did you-- can I talk a little bit about it?
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.940]   Because I mean, I have used to--
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.580]   You could defend it if you want, but people
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.820]   should know that you do work for a Sony.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.220]   And so that maybe, if you don't want to say anything,
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.840]   you don't have to.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.960]   But you like it?
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.840]   I do, actually.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.120]   Look, look.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.040]   We've just claimed it.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.240]   Now you could say it, what do you think?
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.520]   I have played some really fun games.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.920]   Would you say you hated it if you hated it?
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.480]   No, no.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.800]   I couldn't say I hated it.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.720]   But I can say that I have had a really fun time playing
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.800]   a lot of the type--
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.160]   like sports champions playing the gladiator level.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.960]   Did you try the gladiator game?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.160]   Dude, it's so awesome to shield bash people, whatever.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.040]   Shield bash.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.400]   It's like my world of Warcraft fantasies coming true
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:08.960]   in real life.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.920]   But what do you find if I had a shield?
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.940]   You can use the second controller as a shield.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.820]   No, you have a we-mote with a globe on it.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.420]   Lip ball on it.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.220]   Well, you can do like, so-come-for and stuff.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.300]   There's some good games coming out of it.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.300]   I guess I'm not enough of a gamer.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.140]   I wasn't impressed.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.580]   And I thought, this is too much like the Wii.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.660]   Frankly, I play PC games more than anything.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.020]   So--
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.820]   You know how I roll.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.020]   But I am excited about Connect, which you called
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.220]   Natalia Cara, because you're in the inside.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:34.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.080]   Sorry.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.580]   It's all we go.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.080]   It's right.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:36.580]   It's Connect.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.860]   We called it-- we demoed it at D this year.
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.920]   In fact, my son played it.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.080]   It's fun, isn't it?
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.640]   It looks-- yeah, it looks-- well, I look like a dork doing it.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.520]   But it was--
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.960]   Oh, everybody looks like a dork.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.200]   That's one of the problems with all of these,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.240]   with the Wii, with the move and with Connect,
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.160]   is you can't help but look dorky playing them.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.760]   Absolutely.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.840]   It looks pretty good.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.760]   But I think we're just going to get over that.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.920]   I mean, people play it socially.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.040]   The Wii was very popular.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:00.520]   It's just--
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.040]   Any technology that makes gaming more immersive,
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.600]   I'm fine with.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.920]   You know, I'm just happy the direction that gaming is going.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.000]   Like, I think we're making a lot of leaps and bounds
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.980]   in recent years to make it a true kind of environment
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.580]   that you're living in, the virtual space.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.940]   And I think it's amazing.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.020]   It's good for some games, but not for all.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.140]   I just like the way that Connect uses my whole body.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.100]   So a shield bash would be like that and the sword,
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.780]   but you don't have a controller, so it's using your whole body.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.980]   Well, you would use your whole body with move, too.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.500]   Yeah, but you have to have the controller in your hand.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.700]   Well, wouldn't you have a real sword in your hand?
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.220]   Well, all you're just not going to hold on to anything
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.140]   when you're doing--
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.220]   Yeah, because I have a good imagination.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.700]   I can't be balanced about this.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.200]   And then not only that, but you got the shield,
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.280]   you got the sword, but then you can leap if somebody sweeps
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   away.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.040]   Yeah, and the ball senses when you're jumping up and down.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.280]   The ball senses when you jump up.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.280]   All right.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.200]   You know, I really just watched Spartacus, Blood and Sand.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.560]   You like that show?
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.440]   You like that show?
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:50.840]   I love that show.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.320]   I love that show.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:51.820]   I love it.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.560]   It's on my Netflix streaming.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.920]   I got to watch it.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.640]   I love that show.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.320]   It's a hell of a show.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:56.840]   Yes, you can.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.320]   No, you can't.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:57.760]   Yes, you can.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   No, you can't.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.240]   Go ahead.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.360]   Keep doing that, because I can then--
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.200]   I've got the switches now.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.180]   Go ahead.
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.380]   I hate to say I haven't actually spent any time with the move
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.140]   yet.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.260]   My partner Peter has, but I haven't had an opportunity.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:12.860]   So I don't know.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.140]   It was my first chance to play with it.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.540]   It wasn't.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.780]   I wasn't horrible, but it--
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.620]   I like the connect, though.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.420]   I have played with the connect.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.460]   I thought the connect was fun, because it was using my whole body,
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.620]   and I felt like it was really jumping around.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.060]   And I like the effect--
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.100]   And for our first gen, I mean, imagine
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.900]   where the connect is going to be in five years.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.100]   It's going to be unbelievable.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.700]   How about 3D?
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.520]   Skip, Bass, move along.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.080]   Interesting.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.760]   I don't see 3D very well.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.960]   I have a problem with focus.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.960]   Me too.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   And so it makes me really--
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.800]   I have a problem with not having a headache.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.400]   Yeah, it makes me really sick to try and look at it for a long time.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.760]   It's a gimmick.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.960]   There's this phrase in the HDTV world,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.880]   and that is TVs are not designed to be good.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.920]   They are designed to sell.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.800]   Well, 3D is completely about selling TVs, isn't it?
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.320]   Absolutely.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.820]   Well, you all bought your HDTV.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.540]   What can we do to get you to buy another one?
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.900]   Well, even I, as someone who doesn't see 3D very well
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.620]   and doesn't necessarily enjoy it more than regular TV,
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.540]   I feel compelled now to buy my next TV to have it be 3D able.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.460]   I would actually--
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.300]   Because just because I feel like that's--
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.740]   if I don't, I'm selling myself short.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.020]   I'm thinking specifically gaming.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.340]   Is that going to save 3D?
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.260]   I think the gaming is better for me than movies, for some reason.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.020]   I've played a few titles in 3D that I've thought were fun,
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.340]   but yeah, I felt a little sick after this.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.440]   Part of the problem with the movies
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.140]   is so many of them are remastered in--
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.780]   or I'm sorry, mastered in Made 3D and Post, which is--
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.380]   Right, no, that's bad.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.360]   You've got to be shooting with the Innersense camera
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.500]   or any of the 3D cameras.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.260]   I am extremely bearish on 3D.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.300]   It was a fad then.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.020]   I think it's a fad now.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.020]   Go ahead and buy a TV that's got 3D in it.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.540]   If you want to--
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.380]   They don't cost it more.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.620]   Yeah, just make sure that the 2D quality is where you want it
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.220]   to be because--
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:51.740]   Well, except--
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.820]   You're not going to watch all your content on 3D.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.460]   I saw some sports stuff on 3D that I thought was terrific.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.100]   Really?
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.100]   Some golfing, the masters.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.200]   I thought it was kind of interesting to see the undulations.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.960]   And I thought it was kind of cool.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.320]   World Cup was also in 3D.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.840]   I think certain things are very well suited for 3D.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.400]   And those things include sports and probably video games.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.160]   And I think that's the two areas where 3D technology is
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.320]   really going to prove itself to the consumer market.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.800]   But I don't know if-- and also animation.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.880]   I think that's another place.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.280]   I don't know.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.960]   You're wearing these dorky glasses.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.800]   They cost a lot of money to replace.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   I think that's a bad thing.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.640]   Dude, I look awesome in those glasses.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.760]   Well, you look awesome in everything.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.000]   You're wearing the stupid glasses that cost a ton of money.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.500]   I mean, in some cases, 3D glasses cost $300 a pair,
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.000]   especially if they have the active shutters.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.280]   You have to replace the batteries.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.900]   You look stupid.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.540]   And if you're like me, they give you headache.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.980]   Well, in five years, we're not going to need the glasses.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.540]   I mean, that technology already exists.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:44.940]   Really?
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:45.980]   I've seen it.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.580]   I've seen it.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:46.980]   That's the most--
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:47.820]   That's lenticular.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.740]   That's lenticular.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.540]   I don't know if you can really do 3D without glasses.
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.220]   You got--
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.780]   Somehow you have to separate the eyes.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.380]   It's not the same, but is it good enough that you can make me--
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.980]   It's not because you can't move.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.680]   You have to be in the sweet spot, right?
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.640]   And even with some H2TVs now, you
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.840]   have to be in the sweet spot.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.680]   I think the--
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.080]   I'm serious on this.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:05.640]   I am very--
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.640]   You know, it kind of reminds me of--
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.280]   Strongly digressing from the rundown.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.200]   No, this is a story.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.080]   We don't have to follow any old damn rundown.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   I am the rundown.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.440]   I'm not yelling at you.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.360]   No, I lean.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:15.920]   Oh, I lean really.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.720]   I'm worried about you.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.440]   Yeah, she'll yell at you.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.560]   She will yell at you.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.240]   She yell.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.560]   No.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.760]   Well, it kind of reminds me--
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   you guys are all too young.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.060]   But for a while, Jaren Lanier and the virtual reality
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.460]   helmet--
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:30.860]   --and everybody was--
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.260]   I'm not that young.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.260]   Yeah, you remember it, Cara.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.500]   And everybody was saying, oh, we're going to be immersive.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.460]   And it was horrible.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.380]   It was like headaches, dysnausea, uncomfortable.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.900]   It was a torture device.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.140]   Remember VRML?
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.980]   VRML?
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.820]   Virtual reality?
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.780]   Micah language.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.980]   That was good times.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.220]   But I think you said the right word for Veronica, which
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.300]   is immersive.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.760]   I mean, we are going towards immersive somehow.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.520]   And you also said the right word, which was Veronica.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.480]   Veronica.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.000]   And I want to say the right word, Citrix.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.160]   We'll be back with Boer, with Veronica, Ryan, and Cara
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:04.800]   in just a bit.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.360]   But first, I want to talk a little bit about go to meeting
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.400]   our good friends at Citrix to a really fine product.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   You can't always meet face to face.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.440]   But occasionally, occasionally, you have to.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.720]   But most of the time, what you'd really like to do is meet,
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.640]   maybe have a conference call, maybe--
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.720]   but bring it to life as engaging as a face to face meeting.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.120]   And that's where go to meeting is so amazing.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.960]   I'll tell you what, and you can install it right now.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.680]   Take about a minute.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.800]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   Once you got on your system, the next time you're saying, oh,
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.320]   I don't want to fly to Brussels for a face to face meeting,
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.360]   or I don't want to have to be on the conference call,
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.840]   because I just-- you know how boring those are.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.240]   You don't have to.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.560]   You send an email.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.720]   You click a link.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.480]   Your conferees are all seeing what's on your computer screen.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.840]   They can take control and show you what's on their screen.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.920]   You can collaborate together on documents.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.280]   And really, you get 90% of what you meet in person for.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.840]   That actual visual connection, the ability
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.400]   to show the PowerPoint presentation,
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.040]   or the keynote presentation, or the spreadsheets
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:12.640]   of the websites.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.360]   It's great for product reviews, for sales presentations,
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.400]   training sessions, collaboration,
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.520]   all right from your desk.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.200]   We use it, I would say, every day.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.320]   Somebody's using GoToMeeting somewhere in the office.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.520]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.840]   Free 30 days free.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.120]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.280]   You will find it a great benefit to your business.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.080]   And I sure will save you a lot of travel time, I can admit.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.400]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.720]   We thank Citrix, the folks who make it for their support.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.840]   So we got some Save the Dates in the mail.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.920]   October 12th, Google TV, the Sony version,
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.320]   is supposedly going to come out.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.360]   We got the Windows phone.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.720]   Is October, I think, 24th.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.760]   20, 21st.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.760]   21st.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.400]   Somewhere in there.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.000]   Somewhere in there.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.920]   Late October.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.200]   Apple says, well, soon.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.640]   Apple TV, we'll figure that out.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.240]   We'll get that out.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.280]   Probably in October, too.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   Probably all three of these things
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.800]   are going to come out in October.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.160]   They can't come out much later than they got to--
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.440]   If you want to get the holiday, yeah.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.840]   I don't need any more set-top boxes.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   Oh, boxy box.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.280]   Oh, I am so ready for more sets.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:20.840]   Oxy box.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.040]   You're going to get the boxy box?
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:22.560]   Yes.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.680]   Yeah, that looks sweet.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.440]   Yeah, the new Roku box boxy boxy box.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:26.960]   We got that.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.080]   Love the new Roku box.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.080]   1080p in October.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.040]   We have to have home theater.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:30.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.800]   No, we'll make the room.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.040]   We will make that room.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.880]   We're going to build some shelves.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.280]   Do you even-- well, you have to.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.840]   It's your job.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.000]   We have so many-- OK.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.200]   Here's what our home theater looks like.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.040]   And this is after pairing it down and taking a lot of the boxes
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.640]   that used to be there out.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.320]   I can name a couple that used to be there.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.360]   So right now, it's obviously receiver, HDMI switch,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.880]   Sonozepi 90, original Apple TV, Xbox 360 slim, PS3,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.240]   sling catcher, sling box pro HD--
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.360]   PS3 test.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.560]   No, we took that one out.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.840]   Oh.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.200]   Tivo premiere.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:10.640]   And there were two others, and I'm forgetting.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.320]   How do you even have time to watch one show?
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.360]   Well, I would say we spent 90% of the time on the Tivo.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:17.880]   On the Tivo?
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.380]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.400]   Tivo, stuff you have DVR'd.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.040]   After all of that, you still got the cable bill.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.680]   You still got the show time for the true blood.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.280]   Yeah, I was shocking, right?
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.160]   How amazing the cable companies--
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.720]   They got you.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.960]   --what amazing job they've done at keeping us
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.040]   from cutting that cable.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.320]   I'm actually OK with the idea of getting rid of cable.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.640]   You're not going to have Daily Show?
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   You're not going to have--
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.160]   Yeah, you can.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.520]   No, no.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.600]   You can watch Daily Show on demand.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.240]   You bet only on ComedyCentral.com, not through who.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.880]   See, that's the trick.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.840]   Maybe Google TV will solve this.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.560]   There's so much-- the content's everywhere.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.480]   So that's the idea of Google, you says, well, we're a search
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:50.840]   company.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.720]   We'll find the content.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.000]   You got to get Hulu.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.200]   You got to ABC.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.560]   You got to get Comedy Central.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.280]   You got to get all of that into my TV somehow.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.640]   Have a way for me to find it.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.240]   Maybe it's an Android device of some kind that's tied to a
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:04.880]   Google TV.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.680]   Maybe it's an iPhone side to Apple TV.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.240]   I don't know.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.760]   But you somehow have to be able to find it and get it into
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.560]   that TV set.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.920]   And the problem is, it's all over the place.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.480]   I don't think it's a concept provider though.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.640]   I don't think it's the concept providers.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.280]   I think ultimately-- and I'm sure Care actually probably
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.600]   asked him inside Durbin' this.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.320]   But it's ultimately the cable networks.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.160]   I mean, they're the ones who are preventing this from
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:24.440]   happening.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.560]   Content providers at ComedyCentral, I think they would
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   love nothing more than to cut their carriage--
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.000]   They want to disintermediate.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.240]   Yeah, they pay a lot of money to Comcast to be carried.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.440]   Well, I think they all protest too much.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.960]   All of them saying, oh, we really want it.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.200]   But then point to the next guy over.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.640]   I mean, obviously cable companies want this to be
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.680]   slowed down as much as possible because they're making
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.960]   all this money on VOD and all kinds of things.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.280]   But I think the Hollywood companies are still on the
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.320]   fence about what they want to do here.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.880]   I think what will be interesting now that Steve
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.080]   Burke has taken over NBC finally, which everyone
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.960]   realized he was going to do, how that's going to work out.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.200]   That'll be an interesting company to watch because they've
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.920]   got so many conflicting desires going on in that company.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.760]   But I don't know.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.640]   I don't necessarily blame the cable companies over the
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.360]   Hollywood companies.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.200]   So Jeff Zucker left NBC.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.280]   Was he a roadblock?
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:13.880]   Yes, he left.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.400]   He left.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.680]   He was--
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.240]   He was--
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.400]   He was kicked out.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.080]   He was booted.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:18.960]   He got the boot.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.600]   I don't know if I would say he's a roadblock though.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.760]   I mean, he was partially responsible for
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.840]   who this existence.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.240]   He is.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.400]   But I mean, I think they have these--
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.360]   When you-- even when you interview them, they have these
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.000]   very difficult feelings around Netflix, around Google,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.040]   around Apple.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.600]   They're still not comfortable with the idea of letting--
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.360]   No, it's so small.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.120]   So if you notice Fox didn't give Apple, they only gave them
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.520]   streaming renting rights.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.120]   Apple wanted much more.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.360]   I mean, I think this stuff--
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.520]   they don't know once they let it out of the gate what's
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.480]   going to happen, and therefore they're holding it back
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.400]   in a lot of ways.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.960]   And I think it's all subject to negotiation.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.880]   But it certainly isn't--
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.120]   But Zucker was GE's guy.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.840]   And now that NBC's owned by cable town, they--
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.800]   With a K. With a K.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.920]   Is this Burke?
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.800]   Is this new guy?
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.880]   Is he a-- he's a C. Burke?
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.920]   Is he a cable town guy?
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.760]   He had a history.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.440]   He was a Disney.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.560]   He was-- we actually put the full D. We had him a D this year.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.720]   I interviewed him at D, where he said absolutely nothing.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.440]   He was like the perfect cable town executive.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.120]   But we put up the video where he said he wasn't going to take
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.160]   over in V.C., which is oops.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.720]   But I think he's-- they're going to take over.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.080]   I mean, Comcast is going to be firmly in charge of what's
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.840]   going to happen here.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.760]   We just say that it's the cable companies that don't want this
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.440]   to happen because they're making all this money
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.800]   on the premium services.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.480]   They don't want to be a bit seller.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.520]   They don't want to be selling a bit--
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.040]   But that's what's going to be interesting.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.680]   That's what's going to be interesting to watch, how they
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.040]   handle.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.440]   NBC has a lot of material within Hulu.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.160]   They're a key partner in Hulu.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.080]   So it'll be interesting to see exactly how they handle it.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.360]   You know, the funny thing-- and I actually
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.440]   remember having a conversation about this a while ago
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.280]   on a panel is really, if you think about it,
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.040]   the cable companies don't have much that they own and control.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.120]   They have an infrastructure.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   And I mean, they have-- obviously, they
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.880]   control some of these relationships.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.680]   And there's no question about that.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.280]   But when you think about what they really, truly own,
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.840]   all they own is that infrastructure, right?
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.760]   And when those content providers do eventually wise up--
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.440]   and they will, it might take a few more years--
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.160]   you're there going to be left high and dry.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.320]   And at the end of the day--
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.680]   We've been saying this for a long time, though.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.360]   I mean, the movie industry knows this.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.360]   They don't like having to sell their movies via HBO
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.160]   or Comcast or anybody else.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.600]   They'd love to have a Warner Brothers
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.200]   app on Google TV or whatever and sell direct to you.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.000]   Why hasn't that happened?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.400]   Yeah, I mean, the thing that amazes me
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.680]   with a cable company is just that they have the one thing
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.560]   that people will pay for.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.080]   And that is really fast internet access.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.560]   That's the one true thing.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.720]   But they don't want to be selling bits wholesale.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.520]   They want to--
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.280]   But they always say that, and then they always
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.080]   wind up doing so.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   They may have no choice.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.960]   You've been saying that for a long time,
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.400]   and now look at them.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.600]   You know, except they get a lot of money from the cable company.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.640]   I mean, we have Bob Iger and Dia a couple years ago.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.440]   And he's been very fast forward and a lot of this stuff
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.680]   compared to other people.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.560]   But you know, he definitely is under pressure
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.880]   from not just cable companies, but Walmart, who's
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.120]   selling all those box DVD sets and everything else.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.560]   And so here they have this giant amount of money
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.720]   that Comcast is paying them or whoever Comcast, Time Warner.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.880]   They're getting that check.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.520]   It's very hard to-- if you're a public company to say,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:23.960]   you know what?
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.640]   I'm going to go with Google, who may or may not control my--
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   So it's fair.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.720]   They don't know.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.400]   They have to make their numbers every quarter.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.600]   And so they're not going-- these people are paid on a salary.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.120]   They're not going to make big risks.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.920]   I just don't-- there's got to be some massive company
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.360]   stepping forward to be giving-- to be doing this.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.200]   But ABC doesn't do it.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.440]   A guy like Zucker, then, his portfolio, his mandate really
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.480]   is, well, let's keep the cash coming in.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   What's that?
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.120]   Zucker's gone.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:53.760]   I'm sorry, Burke.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.880]   But let's keep the cash coming in from our cable companies.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.240]   But let's explore-- because we've got to prepare for the future.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:01.760]   Right.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.720]   Let's explore these-- is that what's going on?
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.320]   Is this-- they're dipping their toes in the Hulu water?
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.120]   Well, they inherited Hulu.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.440]   So it's not something not dipping their toes.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.880]   NBC was in there before.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.400]   It was owned by Universal, but NBC Universal.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.000]   But I think what's interesting to see
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.320]   is what-- this will be a really interesting company
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.600]   to watch because they have so many conflicting situations
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.360]   here, especially having to do with their bottom line.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.000]   And ultimately--
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.840]   It's like AOL time one, or they're doing--
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.000]   I know they're doomed.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.680]   They kind of have a big business.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.080]   It's a question of how quickly people will move off the--
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.440]   you don't move off the cable thing
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.520]   until you have adequate amounts of content
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.400]   you can get elsewhere.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.560]   And I think Steve Jobs at his recent launch of Apple TV
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.080]   said, we all love a good cat video, cat skateboarding video.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.480]   But the fact matter, premium content is what people want.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.440]   Steve's always been--
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.160]   I want the premium content.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.440]   I just don't want to pay it on a rental term.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.080]   Like, I want to be able to buy my content like Alucart.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.120]   Pay $15 for a season of--
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   I think the bottom line knows--
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.680]   I think the bottom line knows HBO.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.200]   We've been talking about Alucart cable for 20 plus years.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.280]   And I don't understand why that's not going to happen.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.080]   The way that the businesses are structured today,
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.360]   it's never going to happen.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.360]   They just don't want our money?
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:10.360]   Put it out.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.560]   Put it out of your mind.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.800]   No, because they get-- the channels that are not successful
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.600]   do better without Alucart cable.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.400]   And the channels that are successful get those carriage
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:19.760]   fees.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.120]   So it's in their best interest not to do Alucart cable.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.760]   Everybody who has a money to interest in this,
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.920]   except for consumers, do not want to do all--
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.440]   Right.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.520]   Alucart out of your mind.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.440]   Alucart cable is now going to have become internet distribution.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.520]   I think it's unbundling.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.840]   They do not want to unbundle.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.520]   And once they unbundle-- and interestingly enough,
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.920]   media companies are trying to bundle up internet contact
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.680]   now because they're hoping that's going to be a way.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.200]   News Corp, all the others--
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.560]   unbundling is like the nightmare scenario
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.880]   for a lot of these media companies
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.920]   because it changes the entire business--
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.680]   how they make money on a daily basis.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.960]   And it creates a very unstable environment
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.040]   for how to make hits, how to create hits.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.960]   And unbundling is like-- you say that word around a Hollywood
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.080]   executive, and it's almost like they're a vampire,
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.280]   and you're shooting garlic at them or something.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.680]   The only people who want unbundling are consumers.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.640]   Consumers, right by the way.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.760]   And disenfranchised content creators who
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.320]   aren't part of a big media company.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:11.820]   Right.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:12.320]   I say weed them out.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.280]   If you don't have good content, if people aren't going to pay it,
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.440]   then you fail.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.240]   Well, yeah, the real bottom line here is that it does get better.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   It's going to make partnerships.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.240]   It's all tied together.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.160]   It's too muddled in.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.400]   It does get better every year.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.120]   I mean, think about where we were in 2000.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.520]   I mean, it was just nothing.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.800]   I mean, I don't pay for Hulu Plus.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.360]   I tried it.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.320]   I just was not into it.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.640]   It's just a deeper back-hadow.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.440]   It doesn't give me shows that I could normally get.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.080]   Yeah, I really regret that $10 a month.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.320]   That's a waste--
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.480]   I don't even understand why that was--
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.920]   I did it one month, and I immediately--
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.400]   It's crazy.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.360]   This is not--
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.000]   They give me enough.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.280]   Give me more shows or whatever.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.920]   But I mean, still, the very existence of Hulu,
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.200]   and the fact that it's actually good,
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.080]   is proof that it is getting a lot better.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.960]   It's just so slow.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.360]   It feels so slow.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.160]   Except they don't make money from Hulu.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.680]   They pull a lot of money out of it.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.080]   Hulu itself doesn't make money.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.040]   And so these things have to make money.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.160]   Is that going to always be that way?
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.360]   Doesn't Hulu charge a significant premium on ads?
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.600]   Well, they're trying.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.240]   They're trying, but most of the money
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.720]   is sucked out by these companies,
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.120]   by these the owners who are hitting--
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.880]   Hulu doesn't make money, but NBC, Fox, everybody else
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.480]   makes money.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.520]   Hulu's the company.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.200]   I mean, it's just-- it's a very early situation,
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.320]   because you can't--
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.080]   Hulu's almost the holding company in this case.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.480]   No, no, NBC doesn't care if Hulu makes money.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   ABC doesn't care.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.200]   Fox doesn't care.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.240]   All it was was--
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:30.640]   Well--
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.560]   This is our way of dipping our toe in the water.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:32.920]   Oh, good.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.200]   It works now.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.560]   We're going to do it on our site.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.080]   The problem with Hulu as an experiment, though,
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.320]   is if the only people making money
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.480]   are the people who have these very large investments in it,
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.120]   then it's never going to grow outside of that.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:43.600]   That's right.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   It's not going to be close to it.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.760]   It's going to hurt in some of its parts.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.720]   Hulu was never intended to succeed.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.840]   Hulu was a way of them trying this out.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.400]   I don't know.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.720]   Well, I take that back.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.840]   The people who started Hulu wanted it to succeed,
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.720]   but all their content partners were sitting there going,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.200]   yeah, sure kid, go ahead.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.000]   Let's just try this.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.480]   It was started by this.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.920]   They was started by the big companies.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.760]   I mean, Jason Kallar comes from Amazon,
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.440]   but he was hired by Jeff Zucker and whoever
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.680]   at the various companies.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.880]   So does that not make sense that they thought, well,
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.520]   this is a way for us to test this.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.600]   If it works, we'll do it ourselves on our own website.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.000]   I'm not sure what they're thinking.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.560]   I think they sometimes don't know what they're saying.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.520]   It's like the Stradid du Jour kind of thing.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.480]   And what's interesting is even though Netflix--
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.840]   I love Netflix and I like the whole consumer experience,
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.480]   they still don't have enough good stuff on it.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.600]   But they bought a lot more.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   They just bought--
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.680]   They're writing the checks.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.160]   They're writing the checks.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.280]   And that's what they're going to--
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.680]   there's going to be a tipping point where they're
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.400]   going to be able to have enough consumer liking
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.880]   that's consumer buy-in and also the ability
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.280]   to get great content.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.440]   They just signed another deal this week.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.760]   At some point, they're going to have--
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.520]   there's going to be a tipping point where they're going
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.520]   to be powerful enough.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.120]   They're the one.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:51.640]   We'll see.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.680]   There can be only one.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.840]   Honestly, I think they're already there.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.120]   And especially after this last week--
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.040]   They're pretty darn close.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.120]   They're battle-star-galactica.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.520]   And what was the other one that they just announced?
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.280]   It was on Instagram.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.200]   Was it like Mad Men, too?
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   Maybe.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.320]   They're like right after--
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.280]   So it sounds like Apple is cleverly
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.560]   positioned because they only have Netflix and the iTunes
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.160]   store, but it sounds like that might be enough.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.000]   And it's certainly a lot simpler than the Google
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.160]   solution, which is everything, right?
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.880]   I think Apple is there aiming more for the day and date stuff
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.760]   or the brand new TV content stuff,
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.360]   whereas Netflix is a little bit more archive-centric.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.040]   So when we see this Sony TV--
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.880]   I presume that Sony TV, October 12,
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.400]   this is the first Google TV device
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.000]   will shortly be followed by Logitech and everybody.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.320]   The other edition and everybody else.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.480]   Is this going to be a compelling product, Ryan?
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.560]   I mean, are you?
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.240]   You know, I'm not entirely sure yet.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.000]   The thing you hear most is Web TV 2.0.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:53.360]   I guess--
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:53.840]   Oh, that's impressive.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.240]   --since the Web TV had a 2.0, Web TV 3.0.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   Wow, yeah.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.480]   I see it, but at the same time, I remember a lot of people
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.920]   discounting Android in the early days.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:09.600]   And I tend not to bet against companies like Google
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.680]   or even Microsoft.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.440]   You know, these guys, they play the long game
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.480]   and when they commit, and they are aggressive
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.080]   and they push hard, they do things
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.240]   that you might not think.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:20.440]   Right.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.520]   It would be possible.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.680]   I'm curious what you think of the Windows 7 phone.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.880]   We just got a demo here at the ATV HQ this Friday.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.600]   And I was pretty impressed with it.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.920]   I'm not like a gazier person like you.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.200]   I've had one for a few months.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.800]   And I really like it.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.440]   I mean, really.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:34.940]   I was deeply impressed.
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.400]   I'm shockingly impressed.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.100]   Good for Microsoft.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.220]   I had one of the few things I've ever heard him say, actually,
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.340]   that he's been actually pleasantly surprised by.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.860]   To see a third horse in this race.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:46.100]   I think that's going to be a fourth if you include Blackberry.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.460]   And then you up home.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.580]   And I don't know.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.260]   I feel like everybody's kind of duking it out
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.340]   for number three right now.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.340]   And it's going to be iOS and Android up here
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:58.420]   and then kind of a distant third for a good long while.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:58.980]   But yeah, no.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.220]   I mean, I think they could have a horse in this race.
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.020]   That's excellent.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.460]   They need to do what Palm didn't, which
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.620]   is successfully galvanize the developer community.
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.940]   They seem to be working hard on that.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.820]   If they can do that, I think they might have a chance.
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.380]   The OS itself is a good start.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.380]   I call it the Bing of phones.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.620]   It's sort of like, wow, I was over surprised.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.100]   I hadn't seen it as long as you had.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.260]   But it sort of was a little pleasant surprise.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.900]   Well, I've been seeing what is now phone seven
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.260]   in different early builds and iterations from Microsoft
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.540]   for about five years.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.860]   I mean, really, really, really long time coming on this.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.940]   And they made some really stupid decisions on the way
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.940]   until they finally decided to just gut it and start it fresh
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.780]   and forget about backwards compatibility.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.260]   And I think it's ultimately going to work out for the best.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.180]   They just-- they really need to get people on their side.
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.780]   I mean, right now, it's really hard.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.740]   This is the problem that Android had really early on.
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.740]   If you remember, is that the App Store
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.060]   followed the success of Android selling hardware, right?
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.380]   Your developers are going to go where the money is.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.740]   They're going to go where the audience is.
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.260]   They're not going to go where they think one or two cool
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:04.900]   phones are.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.580]   And that's part of Holmes' problem.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.820]   So Microsoft needs to move phones,
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.540]   but they also need to do an awesome job at courting developers.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.100]   They seem to be really working.
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.260]   I think they've understood that anyway.
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.220]   They're trying.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.620]   But it's a tricky market.
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.300]   It's a tricky game.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.020]   And it's not easy to get thousands and thousands
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:22.660]   of applications.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.220]   I mean, Apple makes it look super easy, but it's not.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.020]   You said an interesting thing, Cara, the being of phones.
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.900]   So I just thought when I saw it, being
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:34.380]   was a big surprise in terms of innovation and looking
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.540]   different than something, something different and fresh.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.500]   And I just thought it felt like a phone between the iPhone.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.620]   And again, I'm not a reviewer, but it felt like a phone
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.740]   between the iPhone and the Android phone.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.180]   Felt like sitting right between them.
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.460]   And that's why I kind of liked it in some way.
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.700]   But I'm more like an Android phone to me.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.260]   It does put a little less geeky.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.540]   It's like a-- it's very slow.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.060]   It's very slow.
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:53.460]   It's like a UI.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:56.020]   And I haven't played with it, but it sounds like it's--
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:59.100]   To me, I mean, the phone is actually
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.500]   at the level where you don't have to worry about it.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.500]   That's what you want.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.420]   When Palm's first builds of WebOS came out
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.660]   and the Palm pre came out, I mean, there
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.100]   was a lot to be worried about there.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.700]   I mean, the battery life was just terrible.
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.420]   I mean, just awful.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.620]   Like, wouldn't even last half a day in some cases.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.140]   And it was sluggish.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.700]   And there were just so many problems.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.700]   And so it wasn't like Palm with WebOS
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.020]   had the best possible foundation to start with.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.780]   It feels like phone seven is actually--
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:29.780]   It's something else too--
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:30.140]   A good foundation.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.100]   For me, who's been on the iPhone for so long.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.580]   Like going between the Windows phone
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.820]   and going between something like Palm,
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.540]   it's so much more intuitive for me now
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.740]   to be using the Windows phone.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.500]   Like, it just feels more intuitive compared
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.860]   to even with the WebOS.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:47.220]   And you didn't use a Zoom HD or anything like that.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:47.700]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.900]   So you're first time with a Metro.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.540]   Well, I did like the Zoom interface as well.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:51.140]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:51.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.900]   I like that Metro criss-cross thing.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.740]   Eric Schmidt says he's not worried about Apple.
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.660]   He's not worried about Facebook.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:01.580]   We'll talk about who Google's worried about in just a moment.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.020]   Veronica Belmont is here.
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.900]   Ryan Block, Cara Swisher.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.860]   This is Twit.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.820]   You use Squarespace, don't you, for your blog?
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:09.620]   For Soren Laser.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:09.620]   We do.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:10.540]   Soren Laser.
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.460]   Nice looking site.
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.180]   Thank you.
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:14.540]   Squarespace is really-- I think that's
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.060]   where Squarespace does a great job.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.300]   They really have figured out a way to make it easy.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.580]   Did you have a designer?
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.060]   They probably helped.
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:20.580]   They helped us.
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:20.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:21.980]   And they did a fabulous job.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:23.500]   But you don't-- you know, I have to say,
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.300]   you could do it yourself even without design help.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.660]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.020]   If you want to take a look at what Squarespace is capable of,
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:35.380]   they call themselves a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.220]   And it really all starts with these templates.
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.500]   They've got beautiful looking basic templates.
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.060]   But then even if you are not a designer,
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.740]   you can drag and drop.
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:46.900]   You can just move it around.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:51.260]   You can change the design easily, easily,
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.300]   to make it look exactly what you like.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.180]   And if you do know CSS and JavaScript,
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.500]   webin, the sky's the limit, it really is.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.180]   It's amazing.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:58.700]   Great stuff.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:02.980]   So I'm going to go to Squarespace.com/twit,
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:04.740]   and then go to the examples.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.740]   You'll see all the different blogs and sorting lasers
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:07.420]   right up on here.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.340]   There's Kevin Rose blog.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:13.900]   There's Jeff Kanata of TRS is on there.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.820]   Revision 3.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.740]   Let's see.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:17.740]   There's all sorts of good stuff.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:18.860]   Where is sorting laser?
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:20.980]   Well, you just go to the URL, too.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:22.660]   Oh, I could go to just sorting laser.com.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.020]   Couldn't I?
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.500]   Oh, there it is.
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:27.580]   Beautiful site.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.260]   Look at that.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.820]   Isn't that gorgeous?
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.980]   And it's easy to post to, right?
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:34.860]   I mean, they have an iPhone app, which is really slick.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.540]   But a really good content.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:37.340]   So what is Squarespace?
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.180]   It's content management plus hosting.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:44.060]   So that's why you get a great design tool.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.140]   It's a lot of hosts to go there and they go, oh, we've
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.620]   got site builder.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.940]   It's just horrible.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.700]   It's just a nightmare.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:53.580]   Squarespace, it started with the software.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.100]   And the hosting comes along for the ride.
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:56.860]   And great.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.060]   They're using Java and a really sophisticated Java VPS
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.460]   system that really means that you've
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.660]   got bandwidth to spare.
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.740]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.100]   I wouldn't say that if it weren't true,
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.140]   because I'll tell you what people are going to try.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.580]   They really will try.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:11.940]   We're famous for bringing sites down.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.460]   I have tried to V-DOS my own site.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:14.020]   You can't.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:14.740]   It doesn't work now.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:15.940]   You cannot.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:20.780]   Squarespace.com/twit sites start at-- well, if you go monthly,
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:25.380]   13, 33 a month, but if you go for two years, $10.67 a month,
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.740]   and you get 10% off when you use a coupon code twit,
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.060]   and that's for the life of your site.
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.940]   That's the basic sites.
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.620]   They go all the way up for a high-end business site
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.900]   with lots of features, $32 a month.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.620]   That's hosting and the software.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.260]   That's why this is where great websites begin.
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:43.580]   Go to squarespace.com/twit to try it for free.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.740]   For two weeks, you don't even need a credit card.

[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.260]   I think I really recommend it.
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:51.220]   If you're thinking about where to start your website,
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.020]   this is the place.
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:53.380]   Or where to move your website, by the way.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.380]   They can import all the content from your existing site
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.260]   or export it out if you want.

[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:10.460]   So Eric Schmidt is talking to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.500]   And he says, it's not--
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.740]   it's the big interview show.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.180]   He says, it's not Apple we're worried about.
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.340]   It's not Facebook.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.740]   Who are you worried about Eric Schmidt?
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.580]   Who scares when Eric Schmidt wakes up in the middle of the night?
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.540]   Well-respected closed system competitor
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.820]   that does a fine job in closed markets.
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.580]   The opportunity and the bet that Google has made
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.460]   has been on open systems and open platforms.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.540]   It's every reason to believe that we can do the same quality
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.820]   work that Apple has pioneered in places like the iPhone
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:36.500]   and so forth.
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.540]   And you're comfortable with your bet?
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:40.060]   It's a fundamental bet of Google.
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:41.140]   It is the bet of the internet.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.580]   And it's the bet of open systems.
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.620]   Which of those two companies, Apple and Facebook,
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:49.700]   do you consider to be the bigger competitive threat?
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.700]   Well, it's interesting that we consider neither
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:52.660]   to be a competitive threat.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.900]   Our competitor-- no, absolutely.
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.340]   Our competitor is Bing.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.100]   Bing!
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.180]   It's interesting that for years people would ask
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:00.420]   what Microsoft and--
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.060]   We're not scared of Facebook.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:05.180]   We're scared of Bing.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:05.700]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:07.060]   I don't know if they're really scared.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.020]   But you know what I was--
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:08.740]   Is that fun?
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:10.420]   Why would Carol--
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.380]   Why would--
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.220]   But the fun, but--
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.980]   Why would Google worry about Bing?
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.060]   OK, but you know-- well, there's
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:16.100]   a misdirection there.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:18.100]   But you know what I love most about Eric
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.180]   and about these kinds of interviews?
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:24.340]   He does not say like, oh, we are very competitive
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:25.060]   in the marketplace.
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:28.300]   And we are always looking at our competitive players.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:31.340]   He-- the man says the word Bing.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:31.780]   I know.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:32.300]   Says it.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:32.820]   I like that.
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:33.420]   Says Mike--
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.580]   I really like that.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.100]   He's put his foot in his mouth a few times.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.260]   He's scared people.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:39.940]   I appreciate people who are more likely to put their foot
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:41.860]   in their mouths during these executive interviews.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.140]   Well, for us, it's a lot better.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.940]   I don't know if it's better for his stockholders.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.700]   What do you think, Cara?
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:47.260]   Why Bing?
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:50.340]   I think they are obsessed with Facebook.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.300]   You cannot get a Google executive off--
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.180]   just at a regular place where they're not
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.300]   sort of in an official capacity, not discuss Facebook
[00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.420]   extensively.
[00:59:59.420 --> 00:59:59.900]   They're--
[00:59:59.900 --> 00:59:59.900]   Interesting.
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.340]   --that's who they're nervous about.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:01.860]   Why?
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.340]   And I'm sure they're bothered by Apple, too, in the phone area.
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.900]   Obviously, they're quite competitive in that area.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.420]   They just think that search is going towards Facebook.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.020]   They're very worried about their core business.
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.860]   And Bing, as much as they've done,
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.620]   it's been great that they've gotten--
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.380]   Microsoft's a very strong competitor,
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.260]   and they've gotten their share up, mostly from Yahoo,
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.820]   mostly from taking it from Yahoo.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.500]   But the fact of the matter is they've gotten their share up
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.580]   and they have intentions of getting bigger.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.980]   And they're not going to quit, obviously, in this area.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.620]   But that's sort of a past game.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.460]   The new game is about people in search
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:34.660]   and the integration of people in search.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.060]   And I think that they're very obsessed with Facebook.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.140]   But Facebook and their work harder at making their search
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.780]   a little better then, if that's the case.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.780]   Well, what is--
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.780]   Terrible website.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.780]   I'm so interested.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.780]   I'm so interested.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.540]   --is handled right now by one guy.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.540]   It's-- it's--
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.260]   So why is Google's getting out of him?
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.140]   I mean, they've got the people there.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.580]   But people find being able not to need traditional search.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.580]   That there's ways-- in the way it's going in the future--
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.580]   this is the theory at Google, at least.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.900]   The way in the future that it's going
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.500]   is that people will find things based on things like force.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.780]   The whole idea of location, fourth square recommendation,
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.100]   friends, it's a next--
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:09.620]   It's a search.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.620]   It is the next big.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.620]   It is the next big.
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.620]   Plus, social graph plus location.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:12.620]   I think she's up.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:13.620]   But I still think Facebook has--
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.620]   It's the next big revenue opportunity.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.620]   Yes.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.460]   And when they call out Bing that way,
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.860]   they don't have to worry about sounding like a monopolist.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:23.380]   Right.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:23.900]   Right.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.020]   Oh, that's a good point too.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.380]   Microsoft, they're good.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.500]   I think Facebook is going to have
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:31.100]   to see a major overhaul of their entire infrastructure
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.940]   before that's really a concern in that area, at least.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.060]   But you're thinking of search in the traditional sense.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:36.420]   This is--
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.060]   No, I understand the recommendations.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.380]   And I can see that for sure.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.460]   But even on that level, I'm not seeing a lot of interest
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.740]   there for me anyway.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.980]   And I'm on Facebook every day.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:50.180]   I use it pretty constantly, not for fun, just for work kind of stuff.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:54.060]   And I just don't see them doing that well in that area yet anyway.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.580]   I can see why that makes sense to be worried about them in the future.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.940]   But I think it's going to be a while.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:58.140]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.020]   I think there's a lot of other sites that do that a lot better.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:04.300]   I mean, and that's kind of why I hate to make this about my company
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:04.820]   or whatever.
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.580]   But that's why we did what we did.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.980]   We wanted to do a site.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.140]   gdgt.com.
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:13.020]   We wanted to do a site where the social interactions pivoted around products
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:16.380]   because there's a very clear reason to do that,
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.300]   as opposed to just keeping a person a person in order
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.660]   to have something a lot more generic.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:23.300]   I prefer niche sites that cater to what I'm looking for
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:27.060]   as opposed to all the garbage that you're going to find on Facebook from people.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:27.060]   Right.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.060]   And if you look at this--
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:28.060]   But what--
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.460]   But the web, it's a history of fragmentation.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:29.980]   The brilliant thing--
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.140]   It's not a history of consolidation.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.580]   The brilliant thing Mark Zuckerberg did is he got people
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.740]   to give him information about their taste, their interest, their location,
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:38.740]   everything.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:39.740]   Right.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:42.860]   Now, he had to do it by tricking him by saying it's all private.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.340]   However, in the long run, that's not going to make him any money.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.580]   So he's got to move them towards public.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:52.220]   I thought that when you had that same exact insight, Ryan, when you said,
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.900]   well, how could we design a site that gets people to tell us everything
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.860]   about the gadgets they have and the gadgets they want?
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.900]   That's hugely valuable information.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:00.900]   Right.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.100]   Is that the insight that started gdgt?
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.100]   It wasn't that.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.740]   I mean, it wasn't like, how can we get really valuable information about people?
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.220]   It was, you know, we wanted to create--
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.060]   I'll give you more credit than that.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.060]   I mean, yeah, that is--
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.260]   You're not a greasy capitalist.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260]   But no, but that certainly--
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.260]   That is an absolute--
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.260]   That's a huge upside to it.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.260]   That's a huge upside to it.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.100]   In fact, I look at gdgt and I said, that's brilliant because what, you know,
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.700]   that's what Facebook, that was the insight Facebook had.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:26.260]   Now, Facebook has a more compelling reason to do that.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.220]   People do it so they can get laid.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.220]   Gdgt, I don't know.
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.740]   We do see you can get laid with your iPhone.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.940]   Yeah, no, we've learned that that's not true, actually.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.940]   Yes.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:35.940]   No, that's--
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:36.940]   That's right.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.740]   Didn't help me at all.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:43.380]   No, I think that that's the issue, though, is he's got a very compelling story to tell.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:46.220]   It's social and people want to meet and greet.
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.140]   It's not just to get laid, obviously, it's to meet old friends and hook up with your
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.260]   old high school friends and things like that.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:54.220]   That's a very compelling story, but he's got this very difficult issue, which is, it's
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.220]   not--
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.100]   You're not making any money if it's private.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.100]   And I think it's very clear, Google understands it's not--
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.500]   Search is not search anymore.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   It's not the future for Google.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500]   It's more than that.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.260]   It's that you don't have a relationship with Google.
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:09.140]   I mean, you do in Gmail to an extent, but Google is trying with their various social
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.860]   attempts, which most of which have not worked very well.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:14.180]   The problem is Google's a social is a phone book.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.940]   You don't have a very good relationship with a telephone book or an encyclopedia, which
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.940]   is very useful.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.780]   It doesn't mean they're not useful, but they realize that you have a relationship with
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.940]   Facebook as a consumer that they don't have with you.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:31.060]   And as you spend more time on Facebook and you're able to get what you want out of it,
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.060]   get lots of things.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.460]   And it's not traditional search.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.220]   You're able to find what you need.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:37.420]   They're very worried about that.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.420]   And they should be.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.660]   That's something they should be thinking about strongly.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.220]   I totally agree.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:47.420]   And that's-- you know, baking social in from the ground up, I think is probably the most
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.420]   important aspect.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:52.100]   But it's double-edged sword because you did it initially, at least at Facebook, with
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.660]   the promise it was private.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.660]   Right.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.300]   You know, the relationship-- I didn't want to have a relationship with Facebook.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.900]   I want to have a relationship with my friends.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.580]   Facebook's just the carrier.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.060]   And all of a sudden they're saying, "Well, we really would love to use this information."
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.060]   In other ways.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:08.140]   Kind of like the general assumption going forward that all websites do not assume anything is
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.140]   private, ever.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.140]   Right.
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.140]   We know that now.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.140]   Well, I mean, I think the thing that--
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.140]   You learned that.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.140]   You should be doing it.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.140]   You learned it.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.140]   You have to do two things.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.940]   One, you have to bake, you know, the public nature of the website into the experience.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.380]   I think Twitter's done the better job at that, right?
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.620]   Twitter has made it very clear.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.500]   Like, the Zal public, you can try to hide some of this stuff.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:31.300]   But, you know, there's never really this thinking behind Twitter where, you know, we're
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.740]   going to keep you private and then we're going to transition you to public.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.980]   I mean, it's just assumed public.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.180]   And, you know, that's something we do.
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.620]   And, you know, the other aspect is baking in, you know, social from the ground up.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:47.180]   And that's, I think, actually the thing that not just Google, but a lot of companies are
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.420]   having a big, big problem with right now.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.060]   They're figuring out how to bake in social.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.380]   And when they can't figure out how to bake in social into their product, they just go
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.380]   to Facebook and they throw up a Facebook page and they do their marketing on Facebook.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:58.580]   And that's why Facebook is winning.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.460]   It's because they understand social.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.460]   Hence Yahoo.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:06.060]   I mean, Facebook is Yahoo's social strategy at this moment.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.060]   Wow, that's kind of depressing.
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:08.060]   It's kind of sad.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.060]   It is.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.060]   Isn't it?
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.340]   Well, yeah, we have a, we have a search strategy.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:13.700]   We have a search strategy.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.980]   It's being, we have a social strategy.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:16.980]   It's Facebook.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:17.980]   Right.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.980]   Okay.
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:19.980]   Good.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:20.980]   Better than what they've done.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:22.980]   Why not outsource?
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.980]   We have a photo strategy.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.980]   It's Flickr.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:25.980]   It's Flickr.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:26.980]   What exactly is it?
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:27.980]   They do all that.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.540]   Facebook, let's talk about it.
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.300]   The social network, the movie comes out Friday, October 1st.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.300]   So excited.
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.300]   Who's seen it?
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.300]   Anybody here seen it?
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.300]   Not yet.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.300]   Nope.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.300]   Really?
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.300]   You seen it?
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.300]   No, I'm dying to see it.
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.300]   Amber saw it.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.300]   You loved it.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.300]   No, I was asking you to show off hands.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.300]   Show of hands.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.300]   It's what the moderator does.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.860]   Who has seen it here?
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:49.860]   Not me.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:50.860]   I hear it's excellent.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.860]   Peter Kafka saw it and wrote a pretty good post about it that got a lot of attention about
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:59.420]   essentially saying that Mark Zuckerberg should be more worried than I thought he should
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.900]   be by the Twitter trail.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:06.740]   Well, let's talk about it because Mark is in fact on a very obvious attempt to get good
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.380]   PR.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.540]   He decides to go on Oprah.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.540]   I think I know.
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:12.540]   Let me just clarify that.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:13.540]   Oprah decided that.
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:18.340]   And that is a little unfair to Mark because they were going to do this thing from someone's
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.460]   now and Oprah said this is the day we're doing it.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:23.180]   And I don't believe you get to argue with Oprah in general.
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.180]   No, no.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.180]   I don't know if you're Mark Zuckerberg, maybe you do.
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:27.180]   Yeah, don't think so.
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.020]   No, nobody argues with Oprah.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.020]   Well, but I think in that case that was the time we-
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.020]   Oprah, call me.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:33.020]   I want to argue with you right now.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:34.020]   So she'd win.
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:35.020]   Suddenly you disappear.
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:36.020]   Right.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.020]   It would be seen again.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.020]   She will disappear.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.020]   You will come in and take you off in a Chevrolet.
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.020]   Oh, man.
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.020]   That's what he said.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.020]   No, Gail.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:46.620]   Are you saying there's actually somebody more powerful in the world than Mark Zuckerberg?
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:47.620]   I don't know.
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:50.420]   Oprah is probably one of the most powerful women in the world.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   Oprah wanted to do it.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.580]   So did the mayor of New York and so did the governor of New Jersey.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.700]   So Oprah give- I mean, Oprah.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:00.220]   Oprah convinces Zuckerberg to give 100 million-
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.220]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.220]   She was doing it.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.020]   It's just when the announcement was going to be-
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.220]   Ultimately, I don't think it matters anyway.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:09.740]   I think it's a pretty myopic view because movies do not come out and then disappear
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.740]   two weeks later.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:14.300]   Movies are around forever and they are watched forever.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.300]   And Facebook is not going anywhere anytime soon.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.300]   And this movie will be watched forever.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:23.900]   I have to say my absolute favorite quote from that profile of Zuckerberg was when they were
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.900]   talking to-
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.900]   It is the New Yorker profile.
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.900]   Just sort of about the movie.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.460]   And they're like, you do know that West Wing is one of Mark's favorite shows.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.940]   And he just goes, don't tell me that.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:33.940]   I don't want to know that.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.420]   Aaron Sorkin said that.
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:37.420]   Oh boy.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.580]   He gave a great interview in New York Magazine.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:40.940]   If you get the New York Magazine, it's terrific.
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.820]   And it goes into great detail about how he feels about what he's done.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.700]   You know, essentially, fictionalize this living person's life.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.340]   And it's really very interesting.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:54.820]   Yeah, that really interests me the most is that it is a story about a living person's
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:58.940]   life, you know, pretty much up until the point where we're at now with him.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.620]   And that's really going to affect the person that the focus is being put on.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.900]   I kind of feel sorry for him a little bit.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:08.940]   He's quite upset by it at the night before he went on for Sweatapalooza.
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.540]   He was very upset.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.740]   We had a discussion at dinner about it.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.980]   And he was very, he said, this is going to be the way people see me the rest of my life.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.700]   And this is, you know, he was very upset by it.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.340]   And I said, well, you do end up with the billions.
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.220]   So I guess there's a trade off there.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.980]   But I think it's very, you know, it's interesting.
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:31.540]   Sorkin said he didn't want to let the good, the true get in the way of the good.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.340]   Meaning he doesn't care if this isn't exactly Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.300]   He made it better.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:38.540]   You know, and so that's what that's going to be the problem, I think, for people is going
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:42.460]   to, is this, this, what he's like, or is it sort of a, is it a fixed, is it heavily
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.140]   fictionalized, heavily caricaturized version?
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:48.180]   And you know, that's where he worries me the most is that Zuckerberg isn't the type
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.140]   of person that will really step up and be like, no, this isn't me and try to show examples
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.140]   of the country.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.340]   But you know, fairness and I have a feeling care is going to have something to say about
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.340]   this.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:01.180]   It's not like the founding of Facebook was unconscious.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:06.940]   And it's not like there wasn't a whole ton of really horrible things that happened to people
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.380]   early on at that business.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:13.020]   It's not like Sean Parker was not going crazy behind the scenes and ousted from his position
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.100]   because he was picked up on drug charges.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.780]   It's not like, you know, the Winklevosses were completely, had nothing to do with Facebook.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.460]   I mean, they have matching man purses.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.020]   So, I mean, it's horrible.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.780]   You know, it's not like Zuckerberg is like, you know, some like angel here who's been,
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:29.700]   you know, just completely wrongfully characterized.
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.620]   I mean, no, no, no, I think he confirmed those, he confirmed those items.
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.380]   It was a messy beginning to that company.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:36.380]   No question.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.340]   The fact matter is those Winklevosses, the Winklevosses have gotten, they've gotten paid
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.340]   off.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.340]   And I think, you know, something I wrote, it's like they were present at the creation of
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.220]   something they never could have created and they got paid off.
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.420]   And they got 60 million bucks and that's a lot of money.
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:50.420]   Stop your bitchin'.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.140]   And they also, by the way, sign a confidence, I don't like confidentiality agreements, but
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:58.220]   I believe they sign one and here they are continuing to agitate for more money that they
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.220]   don't deserve.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.780]   Yeah, they're going back to court, right?
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:02.780]   Oh, that's true.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:03.780]   Well, yeah, of course.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:04.780]   But I'm just saying these guys were starting.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.780]   If you go look at their original version, he definitely geeked them out.
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.700]   He definitely slowed them down.
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.700]   There's no questions.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.700]   But they would never have created Facebook.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:13.700]   Never.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:14.700]   They weren't on the track to do that.
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.700]   I mean, he's the brains behind the organization.
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.700]   Never.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.700]   I mean, that's the thing.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.020]   And I think, you know, if you look at the beginning of Microsoft, Microsoft had some
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.020]   get sketchy beginnings.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:28.380]   Oh, yeah, buying a DOS from Seattle software and not saying, oh, by the way, we have a
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.900]   little bit of a contract with IBM.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:35.220]   It's just, I think it's just this has become so interesting from a fictionalized point
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:36.220]   of view.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:40.380]   It's become, listen, Mark Zagarou behaved very badly during that period.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.700]   The fact matter is he paid off the people he paid.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.700]   They all got paid.
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.700]   They got, they got something and he's still got plenty.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.620]   Now let me ask you, Cara, do you have a little soft spot in your heart frame?
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.020]   You were very motherly with him with the sweat and the, I couldn't, when I'm going to
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.500]   attack that and that's really a good point.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.500]   That would have made me great.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.140]   Here's, I was, it was very troubling what happened to him.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:00.620]   He had a very, what was it, clearly a panic attack or some sort of something like that.
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.620]   You kind of start to feel for him.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.620]   He's 26.
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:03.620]   I know.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.620]   Well, I don't care about the age thing.
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.540]   You know, at some point he's got to stop with, I'm so young.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.100]   I don't really care how old he is.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:14.500]   But he definitely had something happen there that I'm not sure what it was, but it wasn't
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.500]   the time.
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.700]   You know, Walt was very firm on him and then it was time to stop because he was clearly
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.020]   in distress, physically in distress.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.340]   And you know, getting the hoodie off was funny and then the thing on it was funny and
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.340]   everything like that.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:30.180]   But there's no reason to continue to pound at him once, once you saw he couldn't answer
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.260]   these very serious questions that he needs to learn to answer.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:38.300]   And I think it said enough, we didn't need to continue to beat on him at that point later.
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:40.100]   We'll beat on him later.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.100]   Not, not today.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.900]   It's morning in Palo Alto, California.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:43.900]   This is Oprah.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.900]   A lot of people are eating breakfast.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:50.340]   The CEO of what might be the fastest growing company of all time is learning Chinese.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:53.940]   He's so, so, so, and I are going to go to China for a vacation.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:59.140]   This is a puff piece designed to, I cannot tell me this is not designed to counter bad
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.380]   publicity, which is going to happen on Friday.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.940]   A hundred million dollars for Newark.
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:06.460]   You think he would have done that if there weren't the social networks?
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.780]   Well, that's, yeah, they were planning the show had been planned for a while.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.580]   No, but this always a social network.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.580]   We knew about the social network.
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.580]   Look, the accidental billionaires came out a year ago.
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.220]   So, we saw this trip a year ago.
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:20.740]   I mean, it's, you know, it's not like they talked about any of the contentious.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:21.740]   He's learning Chinese.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.740]   So he can go to China.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:24.740]   Well, that's Oprah.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:25.740]   Watch here.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.740]   Come on.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.340]   Here comes, I mean, come on.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.340]   Isn't he?
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.540]   He's got the same girlfriend he had when he was a star before he started Facebook.
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.540]   He did.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.540]   He has.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:36.540]   He's cute.
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:38.540]   They've been going a long time.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:39.540]   That's really sweet.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.540]   You know, I tried to get him to go to the, the premiere with me.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.540]   I was trying to figure out.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.540]   Oh, that would have been a scoop.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.140]   I wanted him to go to the premiere, wear a tux, look hot, go up to the goth.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.860]   Well, it's how does he get look?
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:52.220]   Go up to the guy, the guy who plays him and go like, Oh, look, we look alike and go up
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.700]   to the, and say to the press who would have really attacked him there.
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.580]   I mean, he would have been in the center of the press attention.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:01.100]   So, you know, it's a, how you like the movie?
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.420]   He could go, Oh, you know, it was an interesting, really good movie.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.340]   But you know, I wish I dated play by bunnies, but here's my girlfriend for solo who I've
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:07.340]   been going out with 19 years.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.100]   It would have been better if he owned it.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.420]   Yeah, he could have owned it.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.820]   It would have been Larry Ellison would have been there with like 16, you know, super
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.820]   models, whatever.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.900]   How else do you do that kind of damage control?
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.980]   Is he getting bad advice?
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:21.260]   You know, maybe people are trying to make him be something that he's really not.
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:25.140]   I mean, maybe if he just starts to have more of his personality shine through, maybe he
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.140]   doesn't have a personality.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.340]   I'm not sure I've never met him, but he never would have shown up to the.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.340]   Yeah, he never.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.300]   He's just his sister wanted to, but just, but she's alive.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:36.140]   So I, she's got another personality for both of them.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140]   Great.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.140]   Let's take a break.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.140]   We're going to talk a little more about Facebook this.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.140]   We're not, we're not done with this.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:45.140]   Um, had a bad week actually for the servers.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:46.140]   Yes, indeed.
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.900]   Before we get to that, though, I want to talk a little bit about my friends at Ford and
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:53.020]   the fabulous Ford Fiesta.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.620]   I like the alliteration of the fabulous Ford Fiesta.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.060]   EPA, I will start.
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:05.900]   I will not bury the lead on this EPA estimated 40 miles per gallon on the highway, 40 miles
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:06.900]   per gallon.
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:11.220]   The most fuel efficient compact car on the market today, the 2011 Fiesta and it is hot.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.380]   It is so cute.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.940]   It's just the design.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.780]   Just beautiful.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:21.100]   The 1.6 liter Dura Tech TI VCTI 4 engine, the easy few.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.100]   I love this.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:26.220]   The Mustang, the easy fuel, capless fuel filter, you don't have a fuel cap.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.220]   You would like this Veronica.
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:28.620]   I am looking for a car actually.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.220]   Look at the go outside and look at my Mustang.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.220]   I'm like, look out there.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.220]   Well, through the curtain.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.220]   It's got, are you looking for a car?
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.220]   I am.
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.220]   Yeah, because you had a rent a car to come up here.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.220]   It did.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.220]   Zip car.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.580]   Which you, now you, I know you're the type.
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.420]   You would never consider an American car.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.420]   Why?
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:43.420]   Well, you should.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.420]   Okay.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.420]   Time to say times of change.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.420]   No, no, I, I was that kind of person.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:48.420]   No, I'm looking into a Prius because I live in San Francisco.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:49.420]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:50.420]   You want us to do that?
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:54.100]   Prius get 40 miles per gallon.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:58.180]   And this is a gas engine and it's peppier.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.820]   You got the beautiful sink in there.
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:02.620]   They got the four inch multi function display with LCD screen.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.620]   You're going to love that.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.940]   That's standard.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:08.620]   And then you get the optional stuff, which I would get because you're Veronica Belmont.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.420]   He did, he did leather trim seats.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.540]   Yeah, you want that power ship.
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:15.860]   Now, do you drive automatic or a stick?
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:16.860]   You want to buy.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.620]   Oh, you like the power ship six speed automatic.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:19.620]   You love that.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:22.060]   Now, sink is the best thing ever.
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:23.060]   Have you used Ford sink?
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:24.060]   This is the stuff.
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.060]   That's awesome.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:26.900]   You talk to the thing.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:32.060]   And now, by the way, the new sink, the new 2011, they call it my Ford touch does Pandora
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.820]   stitcher slacker.
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.780]   You can, I mean, basically it's, they were so smart.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.260]   They said, look, all of this stuff is happening in the phone, right?
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:45.180]   We will tie our system into the phone, iPhone or Android, whatever you use.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:49.420]   And as features are added to the phone, those will be added in effect added to the car because
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.300]   a car is so integrated into the phone.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.580]   So it's brilliant.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:53.900]   You get true hands-free calling.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.740]   You just say, call Ryan and boom, it does it turn by turn voice directions.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.820]   You don't even have to buy an additional, you know, expensive GPS system.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.820]   It's built in 911 assist.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.180]   So if the airbags go off, I see you have a little wine right now.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:13.740]   So if the airbags go off on the way, on the way home, it calls 911 on the phone, sends
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.780]   them your GPS coordinates, plays a recorded message and opens the mic and says, you have
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.660]   anything to say, help me.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.660]   I'm drunk.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.820]   I'm drunk, I'm falling and I can't get up.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.260]   No, I do not drink and drive.
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:26.100]   No, of course you don't.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.460]   And I would never want to apply that.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.620]   You drink and walk though.
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:30.620]   I do.
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:31.620]   I shouldn't do that even.
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:32.620]   Orly.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.900]   Ryan, you should carry her when she's drunk.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.540]   I have every opportunity.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.540]   Voice activated.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:37.540]   I don't want to know.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.540]   Voice activated piggybacks, right?
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.220]   Voice activated the image.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.220]   Voice activated.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.140]   I'm lost at this.
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:49.300]   Voice activated music and podcast browsing.
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.860]   By the way, this is cool on Android.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:52.860]   Your text message comes in.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.420]   You can turn this off if you don't want it, but it alerts you that there's a new text
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:59.900]   message and it reads it to you in this little, you know, in this little Androidy voice.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:00.900]   It's really great.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.220]   And you can then it has pre-can messages you can send back all without taking your hands
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:05.340]   off the wheel or your eyes off the road.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:06.940]   I mean, this is slick.
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:10.260]   The 2011 Ford Fiesta take, just take a look at it.
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.260]   Very affordable.
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.980]   I know you're loaded, but very affordable.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:19.580]   Nimble, I actually went out to the Ford dealer and test drove one and I was really impressed.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:22.340]   I love the engine.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.700]   Have you seen the Fiesta versus Lamborghini video on YouTube?
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.700]   No.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.140]   I want a Tesla still.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:32.700]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:33.700]   Someday.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.700]   I don't know.
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:38.740]   EPA estimated 29 city 40 highway 33 combined mileage.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.820]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.580]   Drive one this week at a Ford dealer new you.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:46.460]   I am, I'll tell you why I'm really happy to get behind America.
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:50.940]   First of all, American industry, we got to keep it alive in this country.
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:55.780]   Ford is really on the leading edge of modern technology, modern, a modern industrial company,
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:59.420]   21st century industrial company, making great products and I want to support them.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:00.900]   I'm happy to drive a Ford.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.900]   I know you will too.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:05.060]   Drive one this week at a Ford dealer near you.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:07.020]   I've been over a decade with no car.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.020]   Really?
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.020]   How do you go?
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.020]   Because you're a city dweller.
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:11.020]   You don't need one.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.020]   But why do you want to get one now?
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.980]   I want to get out of the city more often.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.060]   Zipcar is great, but we don't live particularly close.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:18.060]   So is that a neat idea?
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.060]   This is kind of a neat idea.
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.060]   The zip car idea.
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.060]   Yeah, car sharing.
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.060]   You just pick it up somewhere, right?
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.060]   There's a lot pretty close to our house, the 10 minute walk away.
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.900]   And do you have an account with them?
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:30.820]   Yeah, you have to get verified with them so they have your driver's license info and
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.820]   your address.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:32.820]   But you don't talk to anybody now.
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:33.820]   You just go online.
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:35.100]   No, unless there's an issue.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:38.180]   If there's like the car is really dirty or it's out of gas or something like that.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.460]   But gas is free, insurance is paid.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.860]   And how much a day?
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.260]   It's about 8.95 an hour for the cars.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.260]   So they buy the hour.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:50.700]   And then it's up to $93 for a full day, depending on which car you get.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:51.700]   That's kind of cool.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:55.900]   So this is how, you know, it's funny how many people come up here in Zipcars.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:56.900]   It makes sense.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.180]   A lot of San Franciscans, even people who are from out of town, they know Zipcars here.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:02.020]   I guess it's in Boston a few other towns.
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.340]   And yeah, car sharing is the kind of thing.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.580]   It's parking that's a hard car in San Francisco.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:09.220]   So it's nice to be able to know that there's a parking spot waiting for your car.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:10.220]   Isn't that awesome.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.220]   When you get back.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:15.180]   That's worth $93, not to have the park.
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.660]   So more Facebook stuff, the network was down bad.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.300]   They said it was a out of control error condition.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:25.540]   They say they fixed it, but boy, it's funny how people depend on Facebook.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:26.980]   The chatroom, we were doing a show.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:29.140]   I think it was Thursday was going crazy.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.140]   Facebook's down.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:31.140]   Facebook's down.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.140]   I don't know what to do.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.140]   I didn't even notice.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:34.140]   I was on a shoot all day.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.940]   And so I had no idea what was going on.
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.940]   And I was like, oh, hey, switch down.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:38.940]   It's something that happened.
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:39.940]   The worst thing that ever happened.
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:40.940]   The crops are dying.
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:41.940]   Help us.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:44.100]   I think that's honest.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.100]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:46.900]   Who will milk my cows?
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:47.900]   Exactly what it is.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:52.420]   I saw some great Twitter posts that I think was on Gawker or something.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:55.980]   And it's just hilarious because they were like, can I do Facebook if my crops die?
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:56.980]   It's like no.
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:03.180]   J5's tell me in the chat room bug frog on Twitter tweeted Facebook down.
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:08.940]   Congress considering emergency funds to help out farmville farmers hurt by Facebook outage.
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:10.940]   It's fun.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:11.940]   It's like the dust bowl.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:12.940]   The Facebook dust bowl.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.020]   We have a crisis.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.500]   But these things haven't actually kind of remarkable that Facebook is as reliable as
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.980]   it is given how much traffic it is.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:22.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:26.140]   And especially considering that they basically have a consolidated server architecture.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.140]   Right.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:30.140]   Right now they're basically based in Northern California.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:33.260]   They don't have they don't have it's not like they don't have farms everywhere.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:34.260]   Well, they do.
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:37.500]   I think they have a CDN, but it's not like Google which has data centers all around the
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:38.500]   world.
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:42.260]   Dozens of them, I think they Facebook is really pretty centralized actually.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:43.820]   They're trying to decentralize.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:48.020]   You talk to Steve Jobs after the Apple event about paying Facebook.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:49.020]   Yes.
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:50.380]   You had a good article on this.
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:51.380]   What happened?
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:54.340]   You know, some are saying that they were negotiating for 18 months.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:55.340]   Apple and Facebook.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:22:01.060]   Yeah, they they were talking a long time and Steve, I think purposely came over to me and
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.140]   said this which because he knew I'd write something.
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:06.500]   But he was sort of belly-aking about the negotiations.
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.620]   They called them onerous terms that Facebook used.
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:15.820]   And so, you know, he was very concerned about not being able to access Facebook.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:18.420]   And I think they were going to do something with either connect or some other ways of
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:22.180]   accessing the API and and he wasn't able to do it in time.
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.660]   And so I guess they went ahead and did it anyway.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:27.020]   And then Facebook blocked them.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.020]   Because it on stage he showed.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.020]   He showed it.
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.020]   He showed it from on the side.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.140]   And it was up on the side.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.180]   So it was here I'm putting my video up again.
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:42.300]   It was up on the site and it was there for time and it said you could you could connect
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:43.300]   with your Facebook friends.
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.300]   It didn't say Facebook connect.
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:48.340]   It said connect with your Facebook friends and Facebook sleep locked them from doing
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.540]   what what they wanted to do.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:54.300]   Yeah, I got it early enough that I was able to do that initially.
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:55.300]   Oh, you you had it.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:59.220]   Yeah, I had it for a little while later that day or I think the next morning it was gone.
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.220]   I didn't happen.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:01.220]   It wasn't that early.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:03.420]   So I didn't get it.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:07.820]   So you know, and then they've still been in, I guess, discussions about how to do it.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:13.820]   Some people who used to work, Facebook was just wasn't true that that that thing would
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:16.380]   have been a big deal to their system.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:20.260]   Others obviously Facebook was saying that it was too much too many requests would have
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.260]   been a problem.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.860]   Well, it turned out ping is kind of a waste of time.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:26.460]   So I don't think those hundred sixty million iTunes users really are going to swap Facebook.
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.900]   It is better that they've added the posting from your library.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:29.900]   This is new now.
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:34.380]   They updated iTunes to 10.01 this weekend.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:35.380]   So what did they change Veronica?
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:39.300]   Now you can comment on the music you already own instead of needing to do it from within
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:40.300]   iTunes store.
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:41.300]   Right.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.860]   So if you see something you like, if you're really enjoying the new arcade fire album
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:46.860]   that you've already purchased, you can just say it right from your library instead of
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.660]   needing to go to their page on iTunes.
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.700]   They have a like a like button.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.700]   Very Facebook.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.740]   I think if you right click on it to get the other options from the other.
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:56.860]   I think that is Facebook on the individual.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:57.860]   Is that Facebook's like?
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:58.860]   No.
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:23:59.860]   It looks like it.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.860]   Should I click it?
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:01.860]   Let's see what happens.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:02.860]   It's darn close.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:03.860]   Absolutely nothing.
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:04.860]   Nothing.
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:07.060]   Let's go to my ping page.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.460]   Yeah, I haven't gotten a lot of you.
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:13.220]   Boy, if I were Facebook, I'd be a little miffed at that thumbs up right there.
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.540]   That did look a little bit like.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.540]   So what exactly?
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.180]   I don't even really know what I'm supposed to be doing on ping.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.780]   Like I go on it and I and people comment on stuff I buy is that that's it.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780]   That's it.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:24.780]   Right.
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:25.780]   Am I just saying something?
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.540]   And you can see what other people do.
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:30.860]   Well, I mean, what do you do on Last FM?
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:31.860]   I don't really.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860]   This is not scrabble.
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.860]   I'm saying, I just say to mind myself.
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.020]   This is so far from scrabbling.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.620]   I don't think that's close to scrabbling.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:43.380]   Well, I'm just saying, you know, these the model I think is actually kind of interesting,
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:47.180]   namely because it's not too terribly unlike what I'm doing.
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.340]   It is social networking based around products.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:51.620]   In this case, it's music.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.340]   I focus on products on gadgets.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.340]   Absolutely.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.340]   The question is, where do you like that?
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:02.180]   Yeah, I like your face head there.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.420]   The question is, what do you do with the social interactions?
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.060]   How do you make it useful and interesting?
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.220]   And you know, it's not it's not the easiest problem in the world to solve.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.940]   Well, one way to do it is to integrate it to more social networks instead of just a
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.660]   wall, a walled pinging garden.
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:18.660]   If it did work with Facebook, which I hope it will at some point, I would find that much
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:19.660]   more valuable.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:20.660]   Did you integrate it?
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:21.660]   I mean, it kind of kills me.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:22.660]   It kind of kills me.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.660]   That's more valuable.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:24.660]   It kind of kills me that they did this.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.300]   I mean, I would have liked to have seen them just by last FM from CBS Interactive.
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:33.740]   Did you ever find out, Kara, what the owner's terms were?
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:37.900]   Oh, I think they wanted, I just they didn't there was all kinds of things that Facebook
[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.740]   wanted them to do in order to do it.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:42.740]   And they just didn't any terms for Steve Jobs would be on our list.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:43.740]   He's not charged.
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:44.740]   You want what?
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.380]   I think he just didn't want to follow their rules.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.620]   They have rules and they he doesn't he doesn't agree with them.
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:54.900]   And he probably is correct in that it probably wouldn't have been a big deal to to do it.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:59.660]   But I think the problem is look, but Google's not very social.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:00.660]   Apple's not very social.
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:03.740]   I mean, there's very little about Apple that's social.
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:07.700]   They build all these socially helpful devices, but they're certainly not social as a company
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:08.700]   with you.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.460]   What is so this is what they're they're dipping their finger into their their their their
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.900]   their toe into this area.
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.220]   Please, please answer me if I if I'm totally missing the mark on this, but what is stopping
[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:23.020]   Apple just from using the developer API tools that Facebook gives out to integrate it like
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:24.860]   to shut down your API.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.860]   Your key.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.860]   They don't want you to use it.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:27.860]   They could just shut it.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:29.860]   So the deal is if you're small enough, you can.
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:32.100]   Yeah, but that's what I was going to say.
[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:34.300]   So, you know, we integrated Facebook Connect, right?
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:37.260]   And I didn't have to go talk to Mark Zuckerberg in order to get permission to do that.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.380]   And we've got, you know, tens or hundreds.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.140]   I don't even know how many thousands of users are using Facebook Connect on gadget right
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.140]   now.
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.860]   But you know, at what point do you draw that line?
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:46.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:51.220]   Like a number where it says like if you if you expect to have more than 50,000 users a
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.220]   day using this, you have to call Apple.
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:57.220]   I think reasonably thought, well, we got 160 million iTunes users.
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.140]   Well, Facebook says they don't like it.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.140]   They're going to pull the plug.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:03.020]   We got to make sure that we're not going to say there's open and then there's open.
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:04.020]   They pulled the plug.
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:05.900]   The Apple Apple deployed it.
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:07.180]   Facebook called interesting.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:12.500]   So that actually happened after 18 months of negotiations, Apple knew that Facebook wasn't
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.500]   happy.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.500]   They still did it.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.140]   And Facebook pulled the plug.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:17.140]   Right.
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:18.140]   Exactly.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:19.140]   Well, just make Facebook look bad.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:23.100]   If you're going to have an open API and you're going to publish all of your protocols and
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:24.700]   you're going to, you know, disagree.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:25.700]   I don't think it's.
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:26.700]   Yes.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.460]   There are terms of service and yes, there are scalability issues you have to do.
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.500]   I don't think it's unreasonable to say 160 million.
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.620]   Well, maybe you better talk to us.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:34.740]   But I don't think I don't think that this was about scary.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:39.300]   High ranking people at Facebook said it was not true, that it's not that big deal on
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:40.300]   there.
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.300]   It's not a very big poll on their system.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.300]   I don't think this is why they pulled the plug.
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:47.460]   They don't want to give Apple a leg up.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:50.740]   I guess they were kind of, it looks like it doesn't look like Facebook.
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.220]   It looks physically.
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.380]   It does count up.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:54.780]   It looks a lot like Facebook.
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:56.340]   It looks like the same color blue.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:00.380]   I mean, that's a color, color, color, color situation.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.780]   But that's, it looks like Facebook.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:02.780]   That's why.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.660]   Well, paying very little value there.
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:05.660]   I agree.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.420]   I just don't see the need to use it personally.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.700]   And you know, I have a situation and I wish they would add this feature as is stupid.
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:17.140]   But my son and my daughter and my whole family buys stuff on my, we have one account.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:24.060]   So for some reason, all the rap music, I'm not, you know, I just want everybody to know
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:29.220]   that while I did like the Sonata number three in D minor, that's what I just liked, it was
[01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:36.500]   my son who pitched, who bought the no-ho remix featuring E 40 B to Wita and the Jaka.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.300]   I did not buy black by D low.
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:43.300]   So I rather enjoy it after listening to my days boy.
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.100]   He played with you.
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:48.100]   Oh, yeah, he likes to be.
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.100]   He likes to be here.
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.140]   Oh, yeah, we got to have base.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.140]   Slappin the base.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.140]   Slappin the base.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:54.140]   Slappin the base.
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:55.140]   Slappin the base.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:56.140]   What movie was that?
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:57.140]   I didn't see that.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.140]   I love you, man.
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:28:59.140]   I love you, man, right?
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.140]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.140]   I love you, man.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.140]   Slappin the big.
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.140]   Slappin the big.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.140]   Slappin the big.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:09.180]   That was the, that was the strangest romance movie I've ever seen.
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.940]   It was the best romance movie.
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:13.100]   See, I think maybe girls like it more than guys.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.980]   You know, I think we like it because it makes us happy to think that guys have these
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:19.580]   little like adorable relationships with each other.
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:20.580]   We like to think.
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:21.580]   We don't.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.580]   That was a weird, don't you think?
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.580]   Did you see it?
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.580]   I love you, man.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.580]   Yeah, no.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:26.580]   We saw it.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:27.580]   Do you think that was normal the way those guys were relating?
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.580]   Yeah, it doesn't act kind of, you know, is that a metaphor for you?
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:30.580]   Is that a metaphor for you?
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:31.580]   You're in my relationship.
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:32.580]   How you and I get, come on.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:33.580]   I have a little.
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:34.580]   That's how you and I make it.
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.580]   Come into my man cave.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:36.580]   We can play some, we'll jam together.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.580]   Exactly.
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.580]   You know, we smoke a little bad.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.460]   That is not, not that never happens.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.020]   No, no, that is.
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.020]   I need to monitor this man.
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:45.020]   I just want to.
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:46.020]   I just want to be honest.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:47.020]   This doesn't sound good.
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:50.740]   Maybe I'm weird, but I, it's, that's too, I wouldn't, I can't never.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:51.740]   You don't bro down?
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.580]   No, have you, but so maybe I'm just too old.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.580]   You bro down.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:55.580]   Do you do that?
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:56.580]   Do you and Peter?
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:57.580]   I don't even know what that means.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:58.580]   I don't know what that means.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:00.580]   Do you and Peter, Ryan, do you and Peter like bro down?
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.820]   No, we just, we work.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:02.980]   You throw down the bro down?
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.980]   We work a lot.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:04.980]   That's a new one.
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:05.980]   I haven't heard throw down.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:10.420]   The reason that people like that movie, women like that movie, is exactly what you said.
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:11.860]   They wish it were like that.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:15.380]   We try to like, I try to like, you know, make little play dates.
[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:16.380]   No, we don't do that.
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:17.380]   It doesn't, you're not interested.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:18.580]   No, our cave is our cave.
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.380]   We don't want anybody else in there.
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:21.380]   Oh well.
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:26.500]   I just, I just, listen, I don't give a poo at men do, but I can just, I just like, clap
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.300]   in the face, slap it at base.
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:29.860]   That's funny.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:34.980]   I couldn't care less what men, what you guys are up to, but slap it at base.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   Let's see.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:39.980]   What else have we got?
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:44.340]   iPhone four for sale in China did very poorly when it first came out because it had no
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.180]   Wi-Fi, but I guess putting Wi-Fi and changed everything.
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:52.660]   Massive lines for the iPhone four yesterday when it went on sale in China sold out immediately.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:54.820]   Of course, they only had 40,000 units.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:31:01.300]   A thousand people, they said a thousand people were in line at the Apple store in Beijing
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:04.420]   to buy the new iPhone four in China.
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:07.020]   That's like 10 people in the US, right?
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:08.900]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:09.900]   Yeah, population.
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.620]   As the percentage of population is not significant.
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:16.220]   See, I thought in, correct, I, I thought in Asian markets, it was more important to
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:20.740]   have the, the really high speed, like data connections rather than, than Wi-Fi because
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:23.380]   they're so, they've got the better infrastructure.
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.380]   Maybe you know, maybe that's why.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.780]   That only Japan or descent is that not very open to China as well.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:27.780]   I don't, I don't know what happens.
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:31.980]   Because Wi-Fi is not widely available, at least open Wi-Fi networks is not hugely available
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:32.980]   in Japan.
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:36.300]   It's just not really something they do as much from my experience anyway.
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.140]   You might be right, actually.
[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:41.340]   You know, when I was in China, of course, I was mostly in the American hotels kind of
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.900]   thing and there was Wi-Fi there.
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:47.380]   But you know, I, they certainly control internet cafes and things like that.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.740]   Yeah, they're all pay for it.
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:49.740]   Right.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:50.740]   People spend the whole day there.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:51.900]   So maybe Wi-Fi wasn't the key.
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:55.580]   Yeah, I'm just wondering what the turning point was if it really was Wi-Fi or if it was
[01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:56.580]   just something.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:58.100]   The iPhone four is certainly not lacking.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:00.780]   I mean, it does support HSUPA.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:05.580]   They added a fourth UMTS band for Japan.
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:07.980]   So I mean, you know, there's a number of factors.
[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:11.380]   Yeah, they're, they're, they're certainly not ignoring the needs of the Asian.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:16.820]   China, UNICOM, the carrier, Chinese government owned carrier that has the iPhone four and
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:20.220]   China says 200,000 pre-orders, 200,000 pre-order.
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:23.580]   But again, well, that's a lot for say the US.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:28.860]   It's not that many for a company, a country where there are 1 billion phone subscribers,
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.860]   800,000.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.860]   It's expensive.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:31.860]   It's expensive.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:32.860]   It's expensive.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.940]   It's expensive phone and it's a single phone.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:39.660]   You know, 200,000 phones is not a small amount of phones for any company.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:40.660]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:41.660]   So.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.660]   That's a lot.
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.940]   I get your point, but I mean, I wouldn't discount it.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:49.100]   It's $905 without contract subsidized $754.
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.020]   So that's a lot for an American.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:53.820]   It's a lot even more for somebody in China.
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:55.660]   Well, you know, there's, there's a lot of oligarchs out there.
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:57.940]   So there must be 200,000 of them.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.340]   Yes, there are.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:02.140]   There are 200,000 oligarchs in China.
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:04.620]   This has been one of them.
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:08.780]   Snoop Dogg wants to buy a sports team with Zuck.
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:09.780]   He tweeted it.
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:10.940]   So it must be true.
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:13.100]   He says, "Ayo."
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:17.020]   See, I know how they talk because I listen to the music.
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.020]   I'm down.
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.020]   Yes, please bring this in the...
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.180]   Ayo, somebody tells Zuckerberg to holler at me.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.140]   He and I need to go buy a pro sports team together.
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:26.580]   Oh, I'd love to see the two of them together.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.580]   I know one of them.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.580]   He's boy.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:29.580]   He's boy.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:30.580]   He play with you.
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.580]   Boy.
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:33.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:34.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.580]   I'm so with it.
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:36.580]   You had to go.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.540]   Pyramitty Dhar, who started eBay.
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:41.060]   I asked him why he didn't buy a sports team.
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:45.140]   And he said that he says, "When you become a billionaire, everybody wants you to buy
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:46.140]   a sports team."
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:49.660]   But he was super interested in hotels because he's a heterosexual.
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.820]   And so he didn't know what to do.
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:52.820]   He didn't know what to do.
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:54.820]   He's a lovely wife and I think, but he really liked hotels.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:57.060]   And he felt terrible because he had no interest in buying.
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:59.420]   Does he have a man bag, man purse, man clutch?
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:00.420]   Like the Vinc, Vinc, Vinc, Vinc.
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:01.420]   He's a beautiful boss.
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:03.420]   He's a beautiful hotel.
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:04.420]   I'll tell you that.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:06.420]   Which hotel does he have?
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:09.420]   Oh, god, now I'm breaking it.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:10.420]   It's down in Laguna.
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:11.420]   I'm blanking.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:12.420]   I'll figure it out.
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:16.300]   Is it Mark Cuban that established this whole thing about the billionaires buying a sports
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.300]   team?
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.300]   Is that why?
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.300]   I must go back further than that.
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.300]   Paul Allen bought the Supersonics.
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.300]   So maybe it does.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.300]   Paul Allen owns the Seahawks and the Supersonics.
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:27.660]   If I ever become rich enough to buy a sports team, who would you buy?
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:30.100]   I'm going to bring back the Hartford Whalers.
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.780]   Aw, isn't that sweet?
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:32.780]   Hockey.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:33.780]   It's not a very--
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:34.780]   I don't even like hockey.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:36.780]   It's got a very invoge sports team.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:37.780]   No, I know.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:38.780]   I think it would be really fun.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:42.300]   I was sure she was going to say a roller derby team.
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:43.300]   More funny than anything else.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:46.220]   Don't you think Veronica should own a roller derby team?
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:48.500]   I think you should own the entire league.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.500]   The league?
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.500]   I mean, it's small enough.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.300]   I think you could have the bell box.
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:53.300]   Nikki Kremel would--
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:53.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:54.300]   She could be your star.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.300]   She's hard core.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:56.300]   She's scary.
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:57.300]   Yeah, I can't do that.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:58.300]   I'm far too fresh.
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.300]   No, no, I'm not saying-- no, I knew you wouldn't skate.
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:05.300]   Oh, is that a-- are you saying I couldn't?
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.300]   I thought you were far too fragile.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.300]   That sounds like a good challenge.
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:09.300]   Well, now that you've challenged me--
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:10.300]   You want to get out there?
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.300]   I'm just saying out of this one.
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:12.300]   I'm just going to do some hair pulling.
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:15.300]   Time to bring back the San Francisco Bay Area bombers.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:20.300]   Would you be one of those-- what did they call them that they launched them into the--
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.780]   I'll have a signature move.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:23.780]   It'll be called the Belmont boob bump.
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:24.780]   I'll just talk here.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:25.780]   I'm going to be going to--
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:26.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:29.780]   I think I just made Leo blush.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:30.780]   You thought about this.
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:31.780]   He thought about this.
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:32.780]   I was just telling you.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.780]   Yeah, he's turning red.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:35.780]   Oh.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.780]   What, you have to bleep that?
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:38.780]   She said boob.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:41.780]   Ashton Kutcher has little Twitter influence.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:48.780]   A study conducted at Northwestern at a university determined that celebrities like Ashton Kutcher,
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:51.380]   Veronica Belmont, with millions of Twitter followers,
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:56.380]   are mostly ignored on the social media site, resulting in very little, if any, influence.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:57.380]   You have how many?
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:58.380]   1.2 million?
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.380]   No, 1.6.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.380]   I hate you.
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.380]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:05.380]   I never claimed to have any influence, but I think my audience is pretty engaged.
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:08.380]   When we talk about stuff, I get really good responses.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.380]   I reply back to a lot of people.
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.380]   I think it's a really good conversation tool.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.380]   Interesting.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:14.380]   I have quite a few.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:17.380]   I have about 700,000, but it's because I was on the suggested users list.
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:18.380]   Yeah, I know.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:19.380]   Pretty much every night.
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:24.380]   I get like 10 Indian dudes ask me out on a date.
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:27.380]   Hey, look, Harris, which of you are beautiful when you'd like to go out on a date with me?
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:29.380]   It means there's something wrong with them, obviously.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:30.380]   Why?
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:31.380]   So I don't get it.
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:32.380]   What is the...?
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:38.380]   I, you know, there's probably a group that are very interested in what I have to say, but most of the people on there have no interesting.
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:40.380]   You know, in my country, Kara means booby.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:45.380]   You know, it's like it's, I'm really happy that a lot of people who may not have been familiar with my work have found me through Twitter.
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.380]   I think that's great.
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:47.380]   It's very powerful.
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:50.380]   If they're not interested in the subject matter, then they're totally free to unfollow me.
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:51.380]   It's no big deal.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:57.380]   You know, I like having the conversations that I'm having with people, and we have a lot of fun, and I think that's valuable in itself.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.380]   I don't need to be influential.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:04.380]   I think the true power of Twitter is not following, you know, the mega users, right?
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:09.380]   The Veronica Bellments of the world, although, you know, I am a follower and I have to say I'm a big fan, Veronica.
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:10.380]   Thank you.
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:11.380]   Thank you.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:16.380]   You know, it's that network of people that you know who are posting links and saying things that you would care about.
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:21.380]   And I hardly use Google Reader anymore, just because all the great news of the day kind of floats to the top for me on Twitter.
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:24.380]   And you follow the people you find interesting.
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:27.380]   It's one of the most useful tools for me at least.
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:31.380]   I mean, I find it useful and interesting and serendipity, all kinds of stuff going on there.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:33.380]   Big fan.
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:36.380]   So I don't know what Ashton Kutcher's deal is, but...
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.380]   Well, I went to the...
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.380]   We're happy.
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:43.380]   These guys, these professors at Northwestern made a website called PulsoftheTweeters.com.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:45.380]   It's the worst website I've ever seen.
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.380]   These guys, I don't know who they are.
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.380]   This is their website.
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:51.380]   This looks like a tag cloud.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:52.380]   It's not.
[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.380]   Everything's in capital letters.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.380]   It's not.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.380]   This tag cloud is not a tag cloud.
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.380]   It is right justified text.
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:00.380]   No, it's just justified.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:01.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.380]   PulsoftheTweeters uses data mining...
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.380]   Data mining.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.380]   Send them in analysis.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.380]   Yeah, like the caps and network analysis.
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.380]   Network...
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.380]   Algorithms.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:09.380]   Algorithms should have been capitalized.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:10.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:13.380]   Well, you know, if you're going to capitalize nouns, capitalize them all.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.380]   But I can't...
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.380]   Okay, so I'm on this site.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:17.380]   Find the most useful influential users on Twitter.
[01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.380]   I can't...
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:19.380]   So what?
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:20.380]   Click ranking, right?
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:21.380]   No.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:26.380]   Click about.
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.380]   No.
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:30.380]   There isn't any ranking on here.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:34.380]   This is the trending topics, but that comes from somebody else.
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:35.380]   I don't understand this site.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:37.380]   Wait, where did you find this?
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:40.380]   This is the guys that say that Ashton Kutcher is not influential.
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.380]   Guys, you are not influential.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.380]   That's a poorly sourced article.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:52.380]   Northwestern professors Alok Chaudari and graduate student Ramanathan Narayana say that if a celebrity
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:57.380]   tweets about his or her area of expertise, he or she may actually have some influence in
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:58.380]   that case.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:03.180]   So if Ashton says, you know, when I'm trying to get Stan on my mark and a cinematographer
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:07.380]   wanders through the shot that's very distracting, then they might have influence.
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:12.100]   But in actors, political statements for interest generally don't hold weight as those tweeted
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.100]   by political analyst.
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:15.100]   I don't know about the movies for Ashton Kutcher.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.100]   He hasn't, like, hit in a long time.
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:17.100]   Wait, no, wait, he just had a hit.
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.100]   What was that movie that he was in?
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.100]   Killers?
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.100]   Yeah, wasn't that a hit?
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:23.100]   No, no, it was not, my friend.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:26.100]   Well, he was in a movie.
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:27.100]   That's more than I can say.
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:28.100]   Well, that's true.
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:29.100]   Somewhere Ashton is cursing you down.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.100]   That's on your goal, Leo, is it?
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:32.100]   To be in a movie?
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.100]   You're chosen for fashion.
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:35.100]   Wouldn't you want to be...
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.100]   Who doesn't want to be in the movie?
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.100]   I don't know what I would do.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.100]   I'm a terror-lacktor.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:39.100]   I don't want to be in a movie.
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.100]   I've been in a movie before.
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.100]   What was your movie?
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:43.100]   I wasn't in it.
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.100]   I wasn't starring it, but I was in it.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:46.100]   You were like an extra?
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:49.100]   No, I was in the audience of...
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:52.100]   God, what was the John Waters stand-up movie?
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:53.100]   It came out a couple of days ago.
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.100]   Oh, yeah, yeah, you were the audience.
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.100]   It was like the filthy something.
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:59.100]   Yeah, I was like right in the front row of the audience.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.100]   Well, that doesn't count.
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.100]   No, but I was in it.
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:04.100]   I was in it.
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.100]   I just want to tell anybody...
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:07.100]   Actually, I've had an extra in a couple of movies.
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:08.100]   I can't remember what the names were.
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.100]   Anybody who's in a movie?
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:10.100]   You live in New York for a while.
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:11.100]   I don't think so.
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:12.100]   It just has any influence.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:13.100]   I learn new things.
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:16.100]   I would like to be in a movie.
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:19.100]   I'm just saying about me.
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:25.100]   About me/Ryan Block, that's where you'll find Ryan's splash page in a monster picture of
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:26.100]   him.
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.100]   That's nice, though.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   It's a beautiful picture.
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.100]   It's so handsome.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.100]   Actually, I took that picture.
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.100]   I took that picture.
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:32.100]   I did.
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:33.100]   That's beautiful.
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.100]   You look good, though.
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:35.100]   Yeah.
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:36.100]   Veronica's on here, too.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:37.100]   She's about.me/Veronica.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.100]   You want to see another big picture?
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.160]   Yeah, please.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.500]   Monster picture.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:41.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:42.340]   Here it comes.
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:43.000]   Here it comes.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:43.900]   Wait for it.
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:44.000]   It's so big.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:44.820]   It takes a--
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:45.920]   Monster picture.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.140]   So the idea is it's like a big splash page.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:49.700]   But everything that you do is right here.
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:51.440]   That's cool.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.180]   Harmonica Belmondo.
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.200]   Harmonica Belmondo.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:58.240]   There was a joke on that 7 x 7 article.
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.740]   If you search for me on that website, the first result
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:02.140]   was Harmonica Belmondo.
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:05.860]   Until they actually posted the article online.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:06.680]   I like Amber.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.020]   I'm calling you Amber from now on.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.020]   Oh, no.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.780]   Amber-- just because of Amber MacArthur.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:11.280]   It's a woman.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.740]   No, that's a compliment.
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:13.740]   That is a total compliment.
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:17.220]   So you're at the hot 20 under 40?
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:19.740]   I was a part of that list, yes.
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.180]   You are the list.
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.660]   Holy moly.
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:25.020]   People were very surprised to learn that I have legs.
[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:26.020]   That's on the--
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:27.020]   That's on the set.
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:27.840]   That's on the set.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.420]   We were just watching you on this show, for example.
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:30.460]   No, you would never know.
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:31.820]   No, it's an axilla set.
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:32.540]   You would never--
[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:33.500]   That's the testilla set.
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:34.820]   That's on have legs.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:38.020]   You will never see Veronica's legs on Texilla.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:39.020]   But now at--
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.820]   I want to see Ryan's legs right now.
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:41.820]   That's the testilla.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:43.300]   Ow!
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.100]   Here they are.
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:46.340]   Gene Cloud is usual.
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:47.860]   Gene Cloud is usual, yeah.
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.740]   But there's stretch genes.
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:50.220]   Yes, I do.
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:51.820]   Cara, I want to thank you so much for being here.
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:56.980]   Cara Swisher is at allthingsd.com.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:59.180]   Or go to Cara.allthingsd.com just
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:03.260]   to eliminate all the other waste of space and just see her stuff.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.180]   No, all things D is a great site.
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:05.740]   Really great site.
[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.220]   Oh, hi, bye.
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:10.860]   You get all the scoops, including--
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:11.380]   what did you call it?
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.700]   Sweat-a-palooza?
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:13.380]   Sweat-a-palooza.
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:14.100]   I don't know.
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:15.220]   That's what you're doing for it.
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:16.140]   Right name for it.
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:16.980]   I like that.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:18.300]   Sweat-gate, I guess.
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.540]   They have to put a gate behind it.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:20.740]   Sweat-gate.
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:21.260]   I guess.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:22.060]   Sweat-gate.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:25.020]   No, a Sweat-a-palooza is so much more interesting.
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:26.100]   It was a palooza.
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:27.020]   It was a palooza.
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.100]   Thank you, Cara, for being here.
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:29.500]   We really appreciate it.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:30.060]   No problem.
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:33.340]   Veronica Belmont is going to head back in her zip car.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:34.100]   Not driving.
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:34.900]   In the passenger seat.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.660]   In the passenger seat.
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:38.580]   Veronicabelmont.com is a place to go, of course,
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:40.660]   and again, about.me/Veronica.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:42.700]   Another great place to find out what Veronica's up to.
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.020]   And don't forget, Techzilla.
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:45.860]   Techzilla.com.
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:49.500]   T-E-K-Z-I-L-A with my good buddy, Patrick Norton.
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.340]   Three times a week, five times a week.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:53.460]   We have the daily episode, five days a week,
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:54.860]   and then the weekly episode, every Thursday.
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:55.900]   You do the daily episode now.
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:57.140]   That's right, yeah.
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:58.740]   And Ryan Belmont--
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:01.100]   That was mean.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:02.340]   I had to do that.
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:02.940]   I like that.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:03.980]   You know, it's actually true.
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:05.620]   Your name carries more weight than mine does.
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:06.100]   Aww.
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.100]   How many days do you have to do Twitter?
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.300]   How many Twitter followers?
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:10.740]   That's certainly not as many as Veronica.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:13.100]   But you and I, dude, we weren't on the suggested user list.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:14.460]   We earned.
[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:15.260]   That's true.
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:18.300]   But you left Twitter for a while, so you know--
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:21.260]   I lost-- when I left Twitter in--
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:22.940]   it was like 2000.
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:24.460]   It's like April 2007.
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:27.980]   When I left Twitter, I had-- I was the number one--
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:29.540]   this is how long ago this was.
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.980]   I was the number one most followed person on Twitter,
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:33.540]   5,000 followers.
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:33.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:35.500]   I was the top female for a really long time.
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:36.700]   That was considered a lot.
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:37.700]   I have spaces underneath here.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:40.260]   There was a while I was in the top 100, I think.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:43.420]   But I've never been that well-followed.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.140]   Well, you got the one name thing.
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:45.660]   No.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:46.580]   You got the Elvis thing.
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:47.580]   You got the Elvis thing.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:48.580]   You got the other goals here.
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:48.580]   I know.
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:49.580]   It's kind of pathetic, isn't it?
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:50.100]   Trust me.
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:50.980]   That's not one of my goals.
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:52.140]   No, it's not.
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:54.140]   Because if it were, I would have a lot more followers,
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:54.620]   Cara.
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:55.380]   Thank you very much.
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:56.500]   If it were, you'd be depressed.
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:58.860]   You got 37,000 75 followers.
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:43:59.540]   He's doing well for himself.
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.420]   Everybody should follow @Ryan on Twitter.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:02.820]   Hi, I am following you because I'm--
[01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:03.460]   There you go.
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.460]   See, I'm already following.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:05.460]   I'm already following you.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:06.660]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.500]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:08.500]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:09.060]   Three more.
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:12.020]   Hey, can me a Twitter, a Twitter user.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.860]   Oh, Lord.
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:16.300]   You can follow me on gajou.com/Ryan.
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:17.540]   That's the place to follow him.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:18.460]   Yeah.
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.900]   G-D-T dot com.
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:22.660]   That's kind of fun, isn't it?
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:26.140]   You know, I mean, the funny thing is people still haven't
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.100]   quite gotten--
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:28.420]   I get a lot of questions.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.780]   Oh, what router do you use?
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:31.620]   You don't have to ask me.
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:32.700]   It's right there.
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:34.860]   I created a whole website for this thing.
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:35.700]   Just go.
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.260]   You don't have to-- now, can I--
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:39.940]   if I were going to follow you on G-D-G-T, do I search for you
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:41.540]   or just do slash Ryan?
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:43.980]   Yeah, you can do just slash Ryan.
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:46.620]   And I'm slash Leo LaPorte like that.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:48.740]   That's actually, I think, that's only for a couple of the
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:49.580]   employees.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.100]   Oh.
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:51.100]   Makes it a little bit easier.
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:52.100]   There he is.
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:52.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:53.780]   Let me see if I can just--
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:55.220]   Well, this has been delightful, but I've got to go see
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:56.420]   the owls of Guahoul.
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:57.580]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:59.060]   Exciting.
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.020]   Owls-- is it Guahoul or Guahouli?
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:01.860]   I have no idea.
[01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:02.700]   I think it's Guahouli.
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:04.020]   Those owls look awesome.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:06.420]   I am going to sleep during the entire three years.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:08.580]   It'll be very relaxing.
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:09.260]   Thank you, Kara.
