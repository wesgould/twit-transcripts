[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.560]   It's time to Twit and with me, John C. Devorak
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.360]   from Devorak.org/blog.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.040]   He's going to be running out on us in a little bit,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.160]   but we thought we'd get him on because he's written a very
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.400]   compelling controversial article in PC Magazine
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.000]   and we'll talk about in a sec.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.840]   David Prager also from Revision 3.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840]   I've been trying to get you on because there have been
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.520]   a lot of changes going on.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.640]   Jim Latterback has left Ziff Davis.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.640]   He was a, we knew him, he was our
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.040]   editorial director at Tech TV.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.880]   He worked at Ziff Davis practically his whole life.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.640]   And he left to go to Revision 3.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640]   He's now your CEO.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.520]   Yeah. So I guess officially started officially
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.320]   started in July and I think--
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.160]   And then immediately took a month off.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.400]   Yeah. In fact, originally he was going to kind of
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.040]   officially start after that point or officially start
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.960]   as far as everyone else was knowing because we thought
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960]   what's the point of having--
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.600]   Right.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.800]   You know, hey, here's our new CEO.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.960]   He's gone in London for a month.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.200]   But then everyone's like, oh, Jim went over to Revision 3.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.360]   So I'm like, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.000]   He's over here.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.840]   It's kind of out there.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.280]   You couldn't keep it a secret.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.360]   Is this CEO--
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.920]   Was J. Adelson basically the CEO in the past or?
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.720]   Yeah, J was-- I guess for more than a year,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.640]   ever since Revision 3 did its Angel Round, which is about a
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.280]   little under a million bucks just under a year ago,
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.440]   J was like the interim CEO because he was also over at
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.880]   Dig at the same time.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.240]   I used to tell J all the time.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.840]   I'd say, well, it's just like Steve Jobs.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   Steve Jobs has Apple and Pixar.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.120]   You know, Apple is Dig and--
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.960]   And they have like, not sure.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.840]   Be your Pixar, right?
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.440]   No, it's a jet, I believe, actually.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800]   But basically, you know, we went around for a whole year.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.920]   It wasn't an urgency to try to get someone to be full-time
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.680]   doing it.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.200]   And then--
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.600]   How come you didn't take the job?
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.120]   Sounds like--
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.360]   You've been running Revision 3, David.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.960]   Yeah, I kind of have been.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.800]   Or maybe--
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.200]   Can I guess why you didn't take the job because you went
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.920]   to the wrong building?
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.280]   What?
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.960]   Yes, exactly.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.400]   Well, I went over to the CNET building when they wanted me
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.680]   to do my job interview for--
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.440]   Is that true?
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.600]   That I went to the CNET building?
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.080]   I dropped off Alex Albrecht at the CNET building
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.680]   to do the Cranky Geek show.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.040]   Is that really true?
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.680]   No, it's absolutely true, yeah.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.560]   John kept saying, as Prager about this,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.080]   I thought he was teasing.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.400]   Oh, no, you know, I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.280]   I just know that he was really late.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.000]   I was going to go somewhere else.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I took the 6th Street exit on 280.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.880]   It's not that far away.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.640]   It's two blocks away.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.120]   Over to 2 blocks away.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.280]   I was up there, saw a big green logo, said CNET.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.040]   I'm like, all right, get out.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.400]   Here we are.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.640]   And then he went in there and said,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.600]   who am I supposed to talk to?
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.280]   And I said, wait a second.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.040]   You're in the wrong building.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.760]   Get out, get out of here.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.920]   I'm sorry that's down the street.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.760]   It's kind of fun though.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.440]   So it's just two blocks away from Z.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.920]   Well, the following week or two weeks later,
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.120]   something like that, they both,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.880]   the same two people, Kevin and Alex,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.320]   went over to be on Tom Merritt's show.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.920]   Not buzz out loud, but they do a weekly live show.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.560]   Anyway, I told him to tell him I dropped him off
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.120]   at Ziff Davis.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.720]   I can't believe how much production is being done now.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.840]   And I also can't believe how much like Tech TV,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.600]   Revision 3, is starting to look.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.520]   And it's all over in the same area, which is weird.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.080]   And this new giga home show is produced
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.440]   or directed by Martin Sargent.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.320]   Well, right now it's,
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.040]   we've got Sarah Lane, myself and Martin kind of working on it
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.440]   because everyone's got a million things to do.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.960]   So we're all basically paying attention to it.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.840]   And so that show right now,
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.960]   we're building studios right now.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.280]   So we're actually shooting that show.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   You're building studios?
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.040]   Yeah, we don't have it.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.840]   Well, we have an office under construction
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.240]   and a studio under construction.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.640]   Where's that going to be?
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.600]   It's all going to be on along the third street
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.480]   where the New Third Street Rail is in San Francisco.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.840]   They do these big warehouse building.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.760]   So we snagged a spot to have an office in there
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.160]   and a spot to build a studio in there.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.320]   And that's really amazing.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.520]   I mean, we're really, Tech TV is kind of coming back
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.720]   on the internet, basically.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.000]   I guess it's been doing that for the past two years now.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.680]   Well, I mean, with both,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.440]   whatever with CNET with Ziff Davis
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.320]   and with, with, with,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.840]   Twitter and with Revision 3 and a couple others.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.360]   So yeah.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.280]   Yeah, who knows what would happen without,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.200]   I wonder if it would have the landscape would be the same
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.520]   if Tech TV hadn't gotten sold.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.440]   I mean, the technology would have evolved the same, I think.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.120]   But I don't know if all the personalities would have been so quick
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.440]   to start putting out content.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.240]   I think this is so much better, to be honest with you.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.360]   I mean, it's not as easy to get.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.280]   And I know people complain about that, but it will be.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.840]   It'll be.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.720]   Now, Patrick is going to join us, supposedly.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.200]   He's in Vegas for DEF CON, the big hacker conference.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.080]   And he never wants to get online over there
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.840]   because he's terrified.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.080]   He said he was going to,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.800]   I know because he's afraid of getting hacked.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.400]   I don't blame him for that, but he's probably looking for--
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.000]   Look, they do do.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.280]   And what does he have on his machine?
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   That's so valuable.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.840]   Good point.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.760]   What you ought to do is just have an EVDO card.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.720]   I think that's quick enough to do a Skype conference.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.840]   Oh, sure.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.440]   Absolutely.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.920]   Absolutely.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.520]   I finally got one of those things.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.200]   I love it.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.320]   Which ones you get, the spread of the Verizon EVDO.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.440]   Yeah, I have the Verizon.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.720]   And at least in most, just about any city, I could just turn them on.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.640]   You know, there's a five gigabyte a month limit.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.240]   I didn't know that.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.240]   Are you sure?
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.720]   They say if you use more than five gigabytes, you're doing--
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.640]   you're probably doing something that's not permitted.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.040]   Like using the internet, I guess.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   I don't know.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.360]   Well, I mean, I can't tell--
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.480]   it's slow.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.040]   It's slow.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   After that.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.680]   For what I do most of the time, what I would need it for.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.240]   I mean, I can't tell the difference
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.920]   between being on a normal broadband connection,
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.680]   because all I'm doing is going through web pages quickly
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.600]   and uploading and downloading piles of email.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.240]   Anyway, Patrick's leaving--
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.120]   we'll talk about this when Patrick comes on.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.760]   But Patrick has announced that he's leaving DLTV.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.840]   And his wife's having a baby.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.600]   His wife's having a baby.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.320]   I don't think he's leaving to raise the baby.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.640]   Is he?
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.800]   I mean, he must be going somewhere else.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.240]   And my question for you is where?
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.000]   Do you know?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.880]   Well, I'll ask him.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.840]   Long silence.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.600]   Wasn't that long?
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.920]   OK, we'll find out.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.720]   I'll ask him.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.280]   Patrick's-- you know, that's his story.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.960]   We'll ask him.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.120]   He's not going to tell you.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.000]   Bubble 2.0, coming soon, says John C. Devorak.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.280]   Wait.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.560]   How can-- wait a minute, John.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.880]   You're saying that the boom cycle we're in right now.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.040]   And we're seeing it, boy, in media, just what
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.640]   we've just been talking about.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.560]   You're saying that's kind of a mirror of what
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.160]   happened in 1999?
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.560]   No, not right now.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.000]   This is a mirror of kind of what happened in 1997
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.400]   when Netscape appeared.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.520]   But see, the difference is there--
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.760]   Yeah, we got a way to go.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.080]   --is that it goes.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.880]   This gets crazy.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.960]   This isn't crazy yet.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.920]   It's just kind of nutty.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.560]   But you think there will be another one?
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.360]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.080]   You can see it coming.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.960]   I mean, look around.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.120]   But there won't be the idea.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.480]   This isn't--
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.680]   I mean, what Prager's talking about.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.800]   They're building studios.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.360]   Building studios.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.280]   People are spending money.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.120]   Disney just bought the little game--
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.640]   Penguin.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.520]   --roaring by three guys for $700 million.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.080]   It's amazing.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.440]   I mean, it's one thing after another.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.320]   And it's just going to continue to go.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.480]   But isn't the difference that there are no IPOs?
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.800]   Doesn't that change the quality of it considerably?
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.640]   Because there's no pressure from stockholders to--
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.600]   Facebook.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.880]   What about Facebook?
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.920]   They're going to IPO.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.000]   They are?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.520]   I don't know.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.040]   I'd see if--
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.560]   I don't know.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.280]   --seems like it, doesn't it?
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.760]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760]   I don't have any insider knowledge.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.400]   Nobody wants to IPO until they get repeal Sarbanes-Oxley.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   But in the meantime, there's all this privatization stuff
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.840]   going on.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.800]   There's these big--
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.640]   I mean, what difference does it make?
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.440]   You can IPO for the $700 million, or you can have--
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.520]   But you don't have the crash if you don't IPO.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.040]   Right?
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.200]   Because you're not public.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   There's no stock to crash.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.400]   As long as your parent company has deep pockets,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.000]   or you have enough VC money--
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.680]   Well, you just go out of business.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.040]   But there's no crash.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.280]   No, no, no, no.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.480]   The crash wasn't just a bunch of dot com companies.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   A whole market crashed.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.360]   And this is what's going to happen again.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.000]   And what exacerbates it is the following scenario.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.480]   Not necessarily these dot com companies being bought up
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.120]   by Disney, but by--
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   7 fact that--
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.840]   These big privatization companies, the KKRs,
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   and all these other guys are buying up all this stock.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.680]   And they're taking millions and millions and millions
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.600]   of shares of stock off the market.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.640]   And since it's everything supply and demand,
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.360]   the whole market is going to go up just naturally.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.120]   And it's going to make it just kind of a weirder bubble.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.160]   And then these all these privatization companies
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.840]   are going to start dumping these once they can figure out
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.800]   how to do it.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.520]   They're going to start dumping all these little companies
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.360]   that they've brought up back on the market.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.760]   There's going to be too many IPOs.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.920]   It's going to go nuts for a while.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.120]   This will be in a couple of years.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.720]   So you say there will be IPOs?
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.600]   Yeah, eventually.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.480]   Because there's no liquidity without a market.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.640]   Until the Sarbanes-Oxley thing is straightened out,
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.520]   I have another column that you probably didn't read,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.200]   which is called Repeal Sarbanes-Oxley,
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.480]   which I made in market, which you felt about.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.560]   Can you quickly re-explain Sarbanes-Oxley?
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.880]   Yeah, Sarbanes-Oxley, which is also known by me
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.480]   as the Public Accountants and Auditors Protection Act of 2002,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.880]   is a system that is put in place to protect not the public,
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.560]   but to protect the big auditing and accounting firms
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.000]   from the debacle that took place when MCI and Enron
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.440]   and all these companies went out of business.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.000]   And all these bean counters, who were supposed to monitor all this stuff,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.760]   were going, "Ah, well, you didn't know.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.560]   "Well, we got fooled."
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.800]   And so now this law was placed to make it so that
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.080]   it essentially takes those guys out of the picture.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's not really their responsibility anymore
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.320]   to actually audit or keep track of a company.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.080]   The company has to do all this extra bookkeeping.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.160]   And the overhead is believed to be about 4% of the profits
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.520]   of any American company.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.280]   Any American public company loses 4% off the bottom line
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.080]   because of all the requirements of this system.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.600]   So nobody wants to go to the owners?
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   Nobody wants to go public as a result.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.040]   Right, and you're responsible for all kinds of weird stuff.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.920]   You can't talk anymore.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.480]   This is why it's kind of ruining the business for,
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.720]   and people can't say anything to anyone.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.400]   I mean, it was always somewhat restrictive,
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.800]   but now it's unbelievable.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.280]   So it's just a mess.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.080]   And so most of these companies doing IPOs
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.800]   are doing them in the London Stock Exchange
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.360]   or they're going up to Canada,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.280]   where they're going anyplace
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.200]   because there's just the American system is not working.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.880]   We are in a boom.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.320]   I mean, there's no question we're in a boom.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.840]   And maybe there is even a rational exuberance.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.120]   I mean, when you see Disney,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.760]   but the 350 million,
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.800]   no, 300 million down in another 350 million
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.400]   over the next two years if they meet user targets
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.520]   for this penguin.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.360]   What is it?
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.000]   Happy penguin club penguin club penguin.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.280]   It's my space for Tots.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.800]   Yeah, it's actually, I went and checked it out.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.080]   It's actually a really nice site out.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.000]   It's very sticky.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.200]   They got a kid who was,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.920]   they got some games on there you can play.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.480]   But if you're a kid or you have it,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.400]   if you're a parent with a 12 year old
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.720]   or 10 year old or a nine year old,
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.240]   you can put them on the sites and not worry about it.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.080]   - A lot of talk about the Goof phone this week,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.280]   Wall Street Journal saying that Google has spent
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.520]   hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.760]   develop a phone platform
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.720]   that they've been pitching T-Mobile and Verizon
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.240]   and other wireless companies in the US and Europe
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.720]   trying to set it up.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.360]   They want a wireless service and they say it'll be ad based
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.080]   a little bit of credence lent to this by Eric Schmidt
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.920]   talking at the De-conference saying that he expected
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.760]   that there would be twice as much to make an advertising
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.760]   on phones and there is on regular online at least.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.720]   That makes sense because if they have GPS in there,
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.240]   they know where you are,
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.760]   they know what you're doing.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.600]   They could, now they've got to be subtle about it.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.240]   - It's going to be really annoying.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.000]   People are going to hate this.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.840]   - That's the got a song.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.320]   - I mean, you're walking past the store
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.160]   and the thing comes up.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.560]   - They would like to buy a thing.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.840]   We're next door, we're right here.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.680]   I see you, come on.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.520]   Hey, where are you going?
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.360]   Come back here.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.200]   - Hey.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.160]   - It could be really annoying.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.360]   But Google's good at subtlety, yes?
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.160]   - Are they?
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.080]   Are they really?
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.480]   (laughing)
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.720]   - Are they really?
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.760]   - I think it's very interesting.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.120]   I just love watching Google.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.920]   I love watching the strategic way they're developing
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.360]   their business and so far they've done a good job,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.200]   don't you think?
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.360]   - Well, there's no denying that,
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.280]   but how long can this go on?
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.160]   And how come nobody can copy what they're doing?
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.520]   I mean, it's not rocket science.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.000]   - Well, but I think they, you know what I think that they're,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.200]   one of their keys to their success,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.000]   they have a very clear vision of what their business is.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.160]   And everything they've done up to this point,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.440]   even though it seems initially far afield,
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.040]   things like the spreadsheet and the office,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.360]   is really all about their core business,
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.400]   which is frankly advertising.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.680]   And they got a handle on it.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.600]   I think they're building eyeballs
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.640]   and they're building a great ad platform
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.480]   and they're just pulling ahead.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.560]   - Pulling ahead of who?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.120]   - You and me. - Pulling ahead of Microsoft.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.360]   - Microsoft. - Pulling ahead of us,
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.600]   that's for sure, but in a way.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.800]   - Well, look what Microsoft's doing
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.120]   and they're thinking about doing an ad-supported version
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.880]   of Microsoft works.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.800]   - You know, I don't get it,
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.920]   where Microsoft feels that it has to, you know,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.320]   Google, Microsoft, all those companies.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.600]   - Oh, Google did it, we have to do it.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.440]   - We have to do it.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.280]   - We have to do it. - We have to do it.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.120]   - Apple did it, we have to do it.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.960]   - Apple did it, we have to do it.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.080]   - I guarantee you that's the thinking.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.080]   - I think Google documents are really good.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.000]   - It works, I use Google Spreadsheet all the time.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.600]   In fact, it's a great way to share spreadsheets.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.280]   You know, we use it all the time for--
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.680]   - I believe I may have been the first person
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.080]   to write about Google documents
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.480]   when it was called Rightly.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.040]   - Rightly was very cool.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.440]   - It was the same thing, it's what it bought.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.920]   - Well, in a way though, I mean, they Googleized it
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.480]   so it doesn't look as cool as it used to,
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.440]   but it's still the same underlying technology.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.880]   Did you get an invitation for Apple's event on Tuesday?
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.160]   I did.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.040]   - I didn't get one.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.880]   - I was actually--
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.920]   - Apple doesn't like Man Blackbould.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.080]   - Where is it, a Muscone?
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.720]   - No, it's a mini event.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.560]   It's a town hall.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.040]   - It's gonna be nothing, they're gonna roll out
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.120]   some new thinner iMacs and that's gonna be the end.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.360]   - It'll be new iMacs, they say,
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.200]   they, this was interesting 'cause usually they email it.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.560]   In fact, I was doing Mac break weekly
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.760]   and I kept looking for the email 'cause the rumors
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.880]   are flying and gadget was saying,
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.000]   yeah, we just got our invite and I said,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.040]   where's my invite?
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.520]   Turns out I had the phone off,
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.200]   they called during the taping,
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.000]   you can never reach me 'cause I'm always recording something.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.760]   But they were very clear, the person who called me
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.660]   from Apple said, this is not iPhone and it's not iPod.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.100]   It's a Mac based announcement.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.540]   You don't think-- - Is it new processor chips
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.540]   inside of the-- - I think it's a new design
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.300]   for the iMac is what everybody seems to think.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.860]   - It's supposed to be thinner and lighter
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.660]   and they may have a big giant screen version.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.500]   - Brush metal.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   - Yeah, brush metal.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.340]   - Wouldn't it be nice?
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.980]   Something like the 30 inch monitor,
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.220]   if that were an iMac, wow.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.980]   - I heard that that's a possibility.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.180]   - That would be a pretty amazing product.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.500]   They need to do something because really frankly,
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.300]   the Mac crowd, and I include myself in this,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.460]   is a little worried because of Apple's focus
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.860]   on the consumer marketplace with the iPod and the iPhone
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.140]   that Apple may be kind of getting out of the computer business.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.140]   They dropped a computer from their name.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.700]   - Yeah, I think it's, the days are numbered for you guys.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.720]   - But you mean I have to buy Windows?
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.780]   - Vista.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.620]   - Vista?
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.940]   No.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.140]   - I first iPhone update came out.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.820]   - No, I just got it.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.540]   - They had to do it because at Black Hat,
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.820]   Black Hat, these hackers are gonna tell the world
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.660]   how to hack the iPhone.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.180]   - Well, I just grabbed this little gooey application
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.020]   that lets you hack it.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.380]   It's called iFuntastic.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.220]   I don't know if you've seen that.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.540]   - What's it do?
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.340]   - It lets you unquote unquote unjail the phone.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.540]   It lets you transfer MP3 files over to it to use ringtones.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.020]   It lets you reorganize what the homepage looks like,
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.740]   remove the icons, reorder them, icons in any order you want.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.740]   And then--
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.980]   - Hey, will you let this do your phone
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.900]   and let me know if it works?
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.740]   'Cause I don't wanna do it.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.660]   - I did stick it on my phone.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.460]   And it lets you, it lets you,
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.780]   if you might see on the upper left,
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.820]   it says like AT&T next to how good signal you have.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.300]   You can modify that logo to be anything you want
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.980]   as long as it conforms within the size.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.380]   - Signal sucks.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.420]   - So, no, no, instead of saying AT&T,
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.820]   you could make it say Twit or you could make it say--
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.660]   - Yeah, that's the right, yeah.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.420]   - Anything you want. - I wanna Twit's phone.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.700]   - Yeah, you could easily do that.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.980]   So I did just that.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.060]   It's, nothing outrageous doesn't let it do anything
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.900]   out rate just either.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.740]   - You didn't break your phone.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.020]   That's all I'm concerned about.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.820]   - Yeah, so it's fun and it's easier
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.540]   than what was released before.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.860]   I think before you had to go through--
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.540]   - Major, major. - Significant amount
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.180]   of additional command line operations.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.940]   - Major stuff.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.780]   - Major stuff.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:37.500]   - I tuned store three billionth song sold,
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.700]   six months to three billion, that's pretty fast.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.460]   It took two years to get to the first billion,
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.020]   a year to get the second billion, six months
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.060]   just to get to the third billion.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.980]   And now the number three retail,
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.980]   music retailer online.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.340]   - The number three, what are you talking about?
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.180]   - The number three in the world,
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.060]   I'm signing the, I mean including brick and mortar,
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.260]   Walmart Best Buy Apple.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.540]   - Oh, okay, okay.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.780]   - Walmart Best Buy Apple, then Amazon.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.780]   - Okay.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.180]   - And I think the music industry is still selling far, far,
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.020]   far fewer music. - Far, far, far, far, far,
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.820]   far fewer music. - They still don't get it.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.700]   The music industry is so clueless, it's so sad.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.900]   - Yeah, they're showing everybody left and right.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.900]   - Eminem's suing Apple, why would Eminem sue Apple?
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.460]   - 'Cause I think in this case, this is legit.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.860]   - For copyright infringement, he says--
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.060]   - Because they used them in an ad, isn't that the reason?
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.860]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, it's because he says--
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.460]   - For an ad, you can't start just using
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.060]   anybody's image as an ad.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.420]   - No, that's not it, no, I'm sure they paid him for the ad.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.940]   He's saying it's copyright infringement
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.180]   because they're selling his music online.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.020]   He said--
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.500]   - I thought it was because he was in an ad.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.620]   - No, no, no, Eminem's music publishers
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.480]   have not given Apple permission to offer
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.740]   the artist's music for downloads.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.140]   Now, normally, the label is who's responsible.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.540]   The label distributes, the label makes the deal.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.420]   But apparently what's happening is Apple
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.820]   is paying its revenue shared universal music group
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.580]   which publishes Eminem's music, but not
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.580]   to the music publishers and the people who own
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.780]   the rights to the sheet music.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.380]   So eight mile style and Martin affiliated,
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.020]   the company's representing Eminem demand
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.260]   that Apple stop offering downloads of his music.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.780]   Now, I guess it's reasonable for them to say,
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.300]   we want some of this money.
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.460]   - Yeah, they're probably not getting it then.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.860]   - Oh, you're right, you know what?
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.140]   You know what, I'm reading more of the article.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.260]   He did sue them over using lose yourself
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.100]   in an Apple commercial.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.460]   - Whoa, they used it and didn't pay him?
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.780]   - I would just say it was a great commercial.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.620]   Remember that great commercial,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.100]   the guy walking down the street
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.380]   and you got to lose yourself in the mood.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.620]   - Oh, it's a great song, I think.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.620]   But I'm just blown away that they didn't--
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.500]   - They settled out of court, so we don't know,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.340]   but obviously Apple said--
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.940]   - And I think that's what started the feud.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.580]   - That's not, yeah, that's not good.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.900]   - You know what, when we were putting together
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.020]   the Giga Oum Show, I originally wanted the theme song
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.700]   of the show to be the biggie small song,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.020]   Mo Money Mo Problems.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.860]   - Good, I like it.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.700]   - And it's been sampled by a couple of,
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.180]   I thought that'd be really funny and kind of cool.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.660]   - How much do they want?
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.860]   - So they wanted, I had a friend of mine in New York
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.860]   who does music licensing and she spent a lot of time
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.700]   trying to figure out all the different owners
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.700]   of the different stuff 'cause some of it was sampled.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.340]   Long story short, they wanted upwards of $2,000 in episode.
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.260]   - Oh! - An episode to license it.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.420]   - Oh!
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.060]   - And so say we put out anywhere near 50 episodes a year
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.420]   if we did it most every week,
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.660]   that's like 100 grand just for the opening music
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.540]   'cause it's like, it's no way.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.260]   - That's more than audible pays us.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.020]   - And I was surprised, especially for, you know,
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.660]   it's an online show, but you know, online shows are--
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.380]   - They don't get that, they don't have a clue
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.620]   that's a difference here.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.540]   - Yeah.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.380]   - And then apparently also you gotta tell them,
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.100]   you know, this stuff, once you put it out on the internet,
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.820]   it's kind of out there, you can't use it
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.620]   for a three week window and then make it go away.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.860]   - So you've got 13 weeks rights,
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.820]   then you have to pull all copies.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.260]   - Yeah, so we're doing a deal with,
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.140]   I think we're about to do a deal with APM
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.460]   so we can use some of their music in some of our productions.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.620]   And so they're actually forward thinking and saying,
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.660]   okay, we understand that these things,
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.300]   we're not gonna be able to give you a window of time
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.740]   to use a specific track 'cause once you release the episode,
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.780]   it's kind of out there.
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.620]   - Yeah.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.540]   - As, you know, video on demand,
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.380]   which means on demand could be a year from now.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.620]   - Right.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.260]   How do you like this guy suing Apple saying,
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.300]   you didn't tell me that the iPhone battery couldn't be replaced.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.820]   - That's stupid.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.900]   - That's stupid is right.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.260]   - Why don't the courts throw things like that out?
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.380]   - Well, isn't there that slap thing?
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.900]   Maybe it's only in California where you can,
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.580]   if you file a frivolous lawsuit,
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.020]   you may be forced to pay illegal expenses for defending it.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.860]   But they ought to have,
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.860]   if it's not, apparently it's in California only,
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.420]   they sure ought to have it everywhere.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.340]   It's ridiculous.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.660]   - Didn't the iPhone's gonna have problems, I think,
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.540]   with their battery eventually pretty darn soon?
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.060]   I mean, I'm already, I've got one.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.740]   I'm already, I have to charge every day.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.580]   - You do?
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.900]   I've been having a great battery.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.300]   I mean, better than most of my other phones, yeah.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.140]   - I mean, maybe it's because--
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.660]   - But every smartphone you charge every day,
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.300]   but this thing I could go a couple of days, absolutely.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.620]   - And I'm already, I make sure that I turn the WiFi off on it
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.020]   if I'm not in range of anything
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.540]   'cause I keep thinking maybe it's searching for it
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.020]   and it keeps eating up battery power.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.020]   - Yes, I turn off the WiFi.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:03.860]   - I turn off the WiFi.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.700]   - I turn off the WiFi.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.540]   - I turn off the WiFi.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.780]   - No, I leave the Bluetooth on,
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.220]   but I would turn off the look for WiFi networks.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.340]   Turn that off, absolutely.
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.380]   I think that does kill the battery.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.180]   But I leave the WiFi on,
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.660]   just the thing where it says look for networks.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.540]   - Mod Chippers.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.380]   - Many Bluetooth.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.500]   - Mod Chippers busted a nationwide raid,
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.820]   16 states operation.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.180]   - And this is a ridiculous story.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.020]   - Operation Tangled Web, why, John?
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.100]   - What's the point of wasting government resources
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.500]   on a bunch of jerk-offs that have little mod chips
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.860]   in their video game consoles?
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.940]   - Yeah, but they're going to 32 states
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.700]   and they got like 50 people.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.740]   I don't even know how they found them.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.700]   I guess they were on a mailing list somewhere.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.580]   And they go cracking into the house
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.180]   and okay, hands behind your head,
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.300]   you got a mod chip.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.260]   Give me a break.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.540]   Is this a good use of the government taxpayer money
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.740]   or what are we talking about here?
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.220]   We've got Fascist America.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.900]   - I love this. - I think it's a ridiculous story.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.220]   - Julie Myers, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.380]   - You know, unless at devices,
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.900]   like the ones targeted today
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.460]   are created with one purpose in mind,
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.340]   subverting copyright protections.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.700]   - What's that got to do with Homeland Security?
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.340]   - Because if we let people steal PlayStation 3 games,
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.580]   the terrorists win.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.100]   - Looks like they won already with these bodies.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.460]   - I think two words, "Oren Hatch."
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:28.020]   - I think you're companies like Microsoft
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.780]   and Sony probably pour a lot of money
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.860]   into political campaigns to make sure
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.780]   that the FBI and Homeland Security
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.780]   keep copyright infringement on top of mind.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.900]   - It's just playing all these out of region DVDs.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.860]   It's got them all pissed off.
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.860]   - Oh, I hate that.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.260]   I hate it when people do that.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.780]   We're lozin' millions.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.980]   And you're right, John,
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.980]   this mod chip is a tiny business.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.020]   It's difficult, no one does.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.180]   I mean, you know, it's a fraction of 1%
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.700]   of all users use this stuff.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.300]   - It's just baffling to me.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.860]   - John, you want to take off at it's 4.31.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.980]   - I'll give you a couple more minutes
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.820]   and then I'll blast off.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.660]   - You're a good man.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.340]   - You shouldn't be giving the time on this show, Leo.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.980]   This is on demand.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.500]   - It could be at 4.31 in--
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.940]   - It could be at 4.31 in the morning.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.860]   - We don't know what time it is.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.940]   I loved this.
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.100]   I don't think we talked about it.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.540]   The Secretary of State of California, Deborah Bowen,
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.860]   who was actually pretty sophisticated technology wise.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.820]   I used to talk to her a lot on my radio show on KFI
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.220]   'cause she was a Southland assembly woman
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.220]   before she was Secretary of State.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.260]   Funded some University of California Berkeley hackers,
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.820]   gave them all the information she had
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.180]   about a variety of electronic voting machines.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.660]   She said, "Go at it."
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.500]   They hacked them all.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.340]   Every one of them.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.260]   Every one of them was hacked.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.740]   And she's now, she has to decide
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.660]   if she's gonna certify these for California state elections.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.980]   But the good news is,
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.180]   the House of Representatives in the US
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.220]   was paying attention to this
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.820]   and they have now agreed on a compromise bill
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.980]   banning paperless voting machines
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.540]   and requiring the one thing that every expert recommends
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.740]   a voter-verified paper record for every vote.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.820]   - I can't, can't don't understand
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.900]   how that disappeared at the beginning with.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.900]   - Hallelujah.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.500]   Hallelujah.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.940]   This is the first time I've actually had any good news
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.740]   to report from Congress at all.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.300]   That's fantastic.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.740]   I mean, I think it was this California research.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.860]   I mean, it was all three of the top systems too.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.700]   It wasn't just debold.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.180]   It was all of them.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.300]   Easily hacked.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.300]   So let's hope that this bill goes through HR 811,
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.220]   the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2007.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:42.940]   And with any luck, this will become the law of the land.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.340]   We got a big election coming up.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.620]   I think it's important.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.060]   - Well, a non-text story also in the political realm
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.860]   is made its tech a little bit
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.900]   is 'cause everyone hated Ted Stevens back to his tubes.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.500]   - Yes, Ted got his tubes.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.740]   - And not a truck.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.180]   And now he's getting investigated
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.100]   and getting his house raided in Alaska
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.140]   for apparently having unethical relationships
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.740]   with oil contractors doing,
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.540]   I don't know, building add-ons to his house kind of crap.
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.580]   - Yeah, they built onto his house
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.980]   and then amazingly got some law in their favor.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.140]   - But I just see in all the tech circles,
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.660]   everyone's secretly really excited about Ted Stevens
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.220]   getting closer to the end.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.540]   - Getting his come up.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.380]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.900]   - The FBI pulled that big truck right up to his house.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.180]   - That's a bad sign.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.020]   - That would be fun to watch.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:32.860]   But you know the thing is,
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.980]   everyone knew this something weird was going on
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.100]   when he was promoting that bridge to nowhere.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:37.940]   - Right.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.780]   There's always been the suspicion
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.940]   that he's been on the take.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.180]   Suspicious.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.020]   Allegedly.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.260]   I be-
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.100]   - Allegedly.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.460]   Allegedly, I don't wanna get suited.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.380]   You know, I finally,
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.580]   on one of our other podcasts,
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.020]   Scott Born, who does the Mac Break Weekly,
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.180]   said, "You know, we need to have a disclaimer
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.340]   "on every podcast that says,
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.980]   "Wait a minute, I gotta read this disclaimer,
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.140]   "that some or all of the participants
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.220]   "may have stock in some or all of the,
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.460]   "maybe I gotta find this."
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.660]   Disclaimer, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.860]   I'd like to read a disclaimer.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.580]   Any or all of the contributors,
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.740]   any or all of the contributors to TwitNet cast,
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.580]   their families, agents, heirs or assigns,
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.060]   may hold positions and securities registered
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.060]   to publicly traded companies mentioned on the TwitNet work.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.980]   Thank you very much.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.100]   That, he got me so scared I filed for an LLC.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.860]   I said, "Geez Louise."
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.620]   Yeah, that's not gonna help.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.740]   Not for that kind of thing.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.140]   No, not for that.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.500]   You're talking about SEC violations.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.500]   - I don't care if I go to jail,
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.340]   I just don't wanna lose the house.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.980]   - For SEC violations.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.500]   - Oh, 'cause it would be like Rico Act,
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.580]   they could take everything?
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.420]   - I don't think so.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.900]   I mean, they basically get fined.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.340]   - Take my iPhone.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.620]   - And then you know, the profit you made
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.140]   from your corrupted--
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.540]   - Martha Stewart's recommendation.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.460]   - Some time in--
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.620]   - No, she spent time because she lied to somebody
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.180]   when they asked her a simple question.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.740]   - Okay, so tell the truth. - Which is another weird law.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.580]   Now you have, you can't, you give the government
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.340]   the Jean-Darm show up, you have to tell them
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.340]   the truth no matter what, which you should say,
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.620]   of course, is I don't tell any anything,
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.700]   I got a lawyer and then have the lawyer do the talking.
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.780]   - Remember that, folks.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.260]   - 'Cause they, you know, can lie for you.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.260]   - Lawyers are allowed legally to lie for you.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.060]   Just point that out.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:13.900]   - They are?
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.740]   - I don't know.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.980]   - They can purge you themselves?
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.140]   - No, it's not perjury.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.460]   - Pergery, yeah, they're oath for perjury.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.780]   - It's not perjury, it's just lawyer ease.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.380]   Lawyers, they look out for each other.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.020]   Is it because it's attorney-client privilege,
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.820]   therefore they don't have to disclose that they're lying?
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.140]   - I don't know.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.740]   - They're not lying, nobody lies, you're not supposed to lie.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.940]   Do not lie, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.980]   - Tell the truth or you could be like Martha Stewart,
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.100]   who is on the cover of Wired Magazine this month
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.860]   with a cake in the shape of a we, I might add.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.100]   - Let's go back to the story,
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.860]   Balmer, we are hell bent on succeeding ads.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.060]   (laughing)
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.700]   - We are, I think we talked about this last week,
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.260]   but it's worth repeating, Balmer says,
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.580]   we are hell bent in succeeding in online advertising.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.540]   This is, well you know a little bit about this, David Preger,
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.940]   I think there was a little heat from some of the diggers
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.580]   that Dig fired Google and went with Microsoft's online ads,
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.020]   which I think is just a fact.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.580]   - Dig fired Google, I think it was more of Dig
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.340]   signing a pretty significant contract with Microsoft.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.740]   - It wasn't Google, it was better.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.300]   - I was gonna say who was more firing,
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.740]   I don't know if it was firing,
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.580]   better anything.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.780]   - Well they were using Google and FM,
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.620]   they were using both.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.860]   - Yeah, and now it's pretty much,
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.300]   you know we're going to use Microsoft for the majority of it.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.140]   - I don't know.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.980]   - What does Microsoft do for you?
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.940]   - Well I mean I don't know the details of what they did,
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.980]   but I'm pretty certain that they signed a pretty hefty deal
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:39.980]   that let Microsoft have most of the say on advertising on there.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.980]   So I think it was a pretty positive thing for them,
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.060]   'cause I think they went to Dig and said,
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.620]   "Hey we wanna offer you a pile of money
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.580]   "to be able to do some of this."
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.900]   And I'm sure there was a lot of negotiation went on,
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.580]   but I'm thinking it was a pretty exciting thing for Dig to do.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.780]   Otherwise they wouldn't have done it.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.300]   - I'm sure there's a lot of money involved,
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.660]   it's a profit thing, right?
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.700]   - Yeah and then I think, I don't know,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.620]   Jay was over at that, Jay Adelson was over at that conference
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.340]   in Idaho, the Allen conference I think it's called?
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.180]   - Yeah.
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.020]   - It's a lot of big wigs over there.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.100]   - That's a big conference,
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.740]   that's where you meet Rupert Murdoch and--
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.500]   - Yeah he said, yeah he was hanging out in some place
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.340]   and there was a bit of a game.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.700]   - So he sat down and chatted with him for a few minutes
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.460]   and I don't know, it's interesting you're walking down the hall.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.220]   - It's like going backstage.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.220]   You go to a rock concert and you go backstage,
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.740]   "Oh I get a backstage patch, oh boy."
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.740]   And you go back there and it's like,
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.100]   "You don't know these people."
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.220]   - It's backstage without the groupies.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.620]   - You got nothing to talk to him about.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.780]   You know what are you gonna say to Rupert Murdoch
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.140]   if you're running into him?
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.900]   Hey, good work on that Dow Jones deal.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.140]   Good man.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.380]   I mean what are you gonna say to him?
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.100]   You don't know him from Adam,
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.500]   you don't know if he likes football or baseball.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.660]   So those kinds of conferences are always just,
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.180]   I don't understand, people just go there
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.220]   so they can be amongst them each other.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.580]   - I got to go to a sushi restaurant with Steve Chen,
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.020]   one of the co-founders at YouTube,
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.500]   right after the whole YouTube Google,
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.100]   or no right after they got sued by Viacom.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.140]   You kinda just sit there and you think,
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.140]   "Well so, what do you think about this whole $1 billion
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.540]   Viacom lawsuit?
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.500]   Does that sound like the question of the day to you or what?"
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.260]   - So you know it reminds me of something
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.260]   that's been floating around there,
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.300]   it was last night on television that,
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.180]   you know Obama auctioned off a dinner with himself,
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.820]   I guess with six people, they won, you know, they sit around
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.900]   so they were showing some clips from it.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.340]   And it's like six people that don't know him from Adam,
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.460]   he doesn't know them, it's maximally uncomfortable
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.100]   for everybody and they're at,
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.420]   he's just trying to keep the conversation going,
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.860]   they're asking stupid questions.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.700]   You look at this.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.100]   - Oh, foreign, Warren Buffett does it every year.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.420]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.580]   - And it's usually some business guy who,
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.900]   - It's very expensive too, it's a very expensive.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.860]   - If you're as successful enough as a businessman
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.020]   to be able to bid half a million dollars
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.260]   to have dinner with Warren Buffett,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.820]   do you really need to pick his mind
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.980]   for advice to make another half a million dollars?
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.820]   - I don't know. - I don't make
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.260]   no sense at all.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.540]   - I had dinner with Warren, you know, I bought the dinner.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.140]   - Have you ever done that, John?
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.500]   Have you ever auctioned off, you know, dinner with Devorak?
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.020]   - Who wants dinner with Devorak?
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.780]   (laughing)
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.100]   - You gotta, I mean, occasionally there's a company
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.540]   with something to pitch me that wants dinner with Devorak
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.540]   and that's about it, but I mean,
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.740]   what's some, you know, I've been to baseball games
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.460]   with, you know, members of the public
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.220]   on certain situations. - Well, there you go.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.220]   - You know, but there's an entertainment thing going on
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.260]   in your second area. - That's true, you don't have to.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.420]   I was on a, in 1989 when the Giants,
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.500]   the year the Giants won the pen and I was working
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.060]   at the Radio Giants radio station
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.420]   and so I was the titular head of the Giants fan club
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.780]   and we had to go on a cruise with the Giants.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.140]   Kevin Mitchell.
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.380]   - You had to go or got to go?
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.220]   - Well, I got to go.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.060]   - Okay, okay, I got to go.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:38.900]   - I was running away.
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.740]   - Well, I mean, let me have one.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.900]   - You know, it was fun, I enjoyed it.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.740]   But Kevin Mitchell was a bunch of Giants
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.300]   and they didn't want to meet the public at all.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.740]   So they just stayed in there, 'cause state room,
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.700]   they literally ate their meals in the state room.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.100]   And so as the only other person there
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.100]   who has anything to do with this,
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.300]   I had to, you know, cozy up to all the paying patrons
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.500]   and yeah, well, I'm so glad you're here.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.340]   Oh, I was painful.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.500]   - Well, I went to the, this last spring training,
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.540]   I was down in Phoenix and I went to
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.460]   or Scottsdale, wherever it were, the A's go.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.140]   And they, I went to the owners party.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.820]   - That's fun. - Which, all these
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.060]   players, you know, and you go there
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.980]   and then you realize you got the same situation
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.780]   as going backstage with a rock band
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.460]   that you don't know personally.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.580]   And it's like, yeah, hi, you know, I'm, you know,
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.860]   and they're, you know, these players are there
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.220]   with their wives, it's like, who's this idiot,
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.060]   you know, kind of thing?
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.100]   It's pretty grim.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.420]   - It works out pretty well with like the Geek Cruises,
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.260]   doesn't it? - Oh, that's different.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.420]   - Like people go there to learn.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.260]   - They're going there to see you guys talk about,
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.060]   about in lectures. - That's lectures.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.860]   That's very different.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.700]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.100]   I actually bailed on the last Geek Cruise
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.660]   and somebody wanted his money back.
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.900]   - Yeah. - They actually had to give
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.980]   some of these money back because I bailed on the reviews.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.380]   - Well, I wanted, obviously had a crush on you.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.500]   - You wanted to meet me, be with me for a week.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.100]   - Oh, speaking about federated media,
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.380]   the big ad network, did you see Morgan Webb's new show?
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.860]   - Oh, hey, yes, I did.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.980]   You know, I take credit for that.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.820]   - Why?
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.900]   - I ran into Morgan at the airport about two or three months ago.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.900]   She said, contract with G4 is running out.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.460]   She was talking to them, some other people.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.900]   I said, Morgan, you should be of all people.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.220]   You should be doing internet video.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.460]   You'd be huge, you'd be very successful.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.020]   You'd make a lot of money.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.020]   Write your own ticket.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.260]   Why are you still working for people?
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.140]   I said, come work for her.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.340]   Come work for Twitter if you want,
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.820]   but I think you could do this on your own.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.500]   She has, she's put it all together and it's,
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.580]   and you know what, it's good.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.620]   She's very good.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.460]   - Yeah, it's actually better than a lot of the stuff out there.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.300]   You know, the--
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.020]   - Mike Harrington gave him a big plug.
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:36.860]   Did you see that?
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.860]   - Well, for real.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.860]   - Yeah, but her husband's an entrepreneur,
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.780]   so it shouldn't be like a big problem to--
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:43.620]   - They got it.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.340]   - There's advertising on it already.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.860]   There's a lot of advertising on the page.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.260]   - They did a big long partnership before,
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.740]   or not, I don't know how long,
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.580]   but they worked it through federated media.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.340]   So, if federated media can't have an ad on the first thing,
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.020]   then they're obviously failing and luckily they're not.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.420]   - No, it's quite good and it's rocket boom-ish.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.980]   But one of the big differences, which I,
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.380]   and I commend them on this, their good choice was,
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.740]   it's somewhat like what we do.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.380]   Only it's five minutes, very quick.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.860]   Talks about the news, but they show the sites
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.180]   that she's quoting, so they give credit to the blogs
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.500]   and so forth, and I think that's great.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.300]   I think that's smart, 'cause the blogs
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.740]   will return the favor, I'm sure.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.380]   - Have you invited her on to Twit?
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.940]   - I have not, I will, but she's gonna be
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.260]   on the radio show on Sunday, so--
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.180]   - Well, I sent her a note and said,
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.140]   "Hey, welcome to the online world."
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.220]   And I said that we always do all these cross promotions
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.500]   with other people, we go on Twit
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.860]   and we go on Ask A New Show and we go on
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.540]   all these other things and she said that
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.140]   she's totally open to doing all that stuff.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:41.980]   - She would love to do that.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.420]   No, no, we've been talking, in fact I promised
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.740]   to have her on Twit.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.900]   It's webalertwithtubies.com.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.180]   And she's smart to do this, I think it's crazy not to.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:56.300]   In fact, she and Adam were the last people still on
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.740]   G4 after, oh, and Joshua Brintano behind the scenes
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.260]   from the Tech TV days.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.140]   Adam was there from the launch day as the only talent
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:05.980]   who still talent.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.340]   - The day for the day one, that's kind of pathetic.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.860]   (laughing)
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.180]   Kinda sad.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.020]   - You know, I got an email invitation
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.860]   to be on Attack of the Show and they said,
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.020]   hope there's not too much baggage
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.420]   and I said, "I didn't wait too much baggage,
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.060]   "there's no way I'm gonna be in Attack of the Show."
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:19.900]   What are you crazy?
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.740]   - Let's see, Attack of the Show.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.260]   - That's the sixth, that's the name of the G4 Show
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.700]   that they basically renamed the screen savers to.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.540]   - No.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.380]   - There's no way I'm gonna be on that.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.740]   - I don't watch G4 at all.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.540]   - That's the other thing, I mean, I would do it,
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.620]   I suppose if we were at the today show,
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.300]   you know, if there were a huge audience,
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.900]   but more people would hear about it than would watch it
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.460]   and would say, "Oh, I guess Leo's supporting G4 now,
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.100]   "I'm not gonna do that."
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.900]   - Oh, there'd be a YouTube clip, everyone would see it.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.380]   - Yeah, I wanna do it.
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.980]   Hey, I wanna thank audible.com for the support
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.380]   that they've given the Twit Network.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.020]   It's a natural relationship.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.300]   Audible is of course a wonderful way to read books
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.980]   on your iPod or MP3 player, cell phone,
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.020]   they work on hundreds of devices.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.860]   Or on your computer, you can even burn CDs.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.220]   This week's Audible book, I don't know if you guys
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.860]   have read this, I talked at the beginning of the week
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.900]   about Andrew Keene, you know, the guy who says,
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.020]   "Oh, the internet is just ruining culture."
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.480]   And I wanted to give a opposing viewpoint,
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.540]   book by Don Tapscott, who I've known for some time,
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.780]   "Wiccanomics, how mass collaboration changes everything."
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.900]   Have you guys either of you read this book?
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.740]   - Yeah, I did, it's actually quite interesting.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.500]   By the way, Elton John agrees with the other guy.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.060]   - Oh, I gotta tell you about that story in just a second.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.900]   - Did you listen to these books in your car ever?
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.220]   - Oh yeah, well when I was commuting to tech TV,
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.740]   I would literally get three hours of reading
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.020]   done every single day.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.220]   I now I put it on my iPhone and it's everywhere I go,
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.940]   I listen to books.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.940]   I have listened to hundreds of these books.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.660]   Audible.com/Twit, it's if you wanna,
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.060]   you get a credit toward a book free.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.700]   I believe it's US only, although it depends on the book,
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.740]   but if you go to audible.com/Twit
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.660]   and search for Wiccanomics, W-I-K-I-N-O-M-I-C-S,
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.020]   that could be your free book.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.380]   Sign up and we thank you for your support
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.740]   and thank Audible for their support.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.140]   It's a great, I am a major Audible fan,
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.860]   I've been a customer for as long as they've been around.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.100]   I think I joined in the first few years of Audible
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.780]   and I still listen to a lot of books.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.740]   Wiccanomics is fascinating.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.860]   Actually it's kind of like the wisdom of crowds,
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.740]   which I should recommend as another Audible book
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.820]   I will do on another show.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.740]   I have a feeling, I don't know,
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.860]   has Kevin ever mentioned that there was wisdom of crowds
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.980]   that inspired a dig?
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.100]   No, I always thought it was him reading/daunt
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.540]   and wanting to see all the other submitted stories
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.380]   to the editor.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.900]   Oh, that's the ones that didn't make it.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.100]   Yeah, yeah, I mean that makes sense.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.540]   I'm sure there's a few factors, but yeah, one of them.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.820]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.380]   So Sir Elton John says they should shut the internet
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.380]   for five years.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.020]   What's the story, John?
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.060]   You probably have it on devor.org/blog, I'm sure.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.540]   Yeah, we did it as soon as it came out.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.020]   I mean it's so funny.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.740]   He came up with this notion and then later admitted
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.820]   that there's no really too much about anything, that's tech.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.780]   But he came up with this concept
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.380]   that the internet, according to him,
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.780]   is keeping people from mixing, you know,
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.260]   going out of the house and to blogging too much.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.220]   And it also has ruined music
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.140]   'cause people are doing music in their garage.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.220]   They're listening to too much music.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.980]   And you know, he just had, it was just like this crackpot thing,
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.460]   like you know, saying that art,
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.380]   and the reason for shutting down for five years
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.380]   is because the art scene will blossom
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.380]   according to his thinking.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.620]   And it's just like, okay, well this poor guy's insane.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.620]   It's just confused.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.380]   He's only 60, I mean, it shouldn't be this old.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.340]   He and Ted Stevens should go off together and...
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.580]   And go to the inner tubes.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.100]   Go to the inner tubes.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.820]   Oh, you gotta, if you get a chance,
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.300]   go to Google and type in Onion internet crash.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.820]   You'll find the Onion did a mock news story
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.140]   about the web crash of '07 when the entire internet went down.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.980]   See, John was right.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.900]   It's usually funny.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.340]   It's really funny.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.380]   You know, the Onion is so well done.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.620]   It's so funny and it's often so subtle.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.060]   The following is brought to you by T.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.620]   Oh, I just started it by accident.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.020]   I shouldn't have started the video.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.540]   It's so subtle that sometimes you believe it's real.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.460]   Well, I've never had that happen, but I can see.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.140]   Okay, I'm a little stupid.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.140]   Maybe you, Leo.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.140]   Wow!
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.980]   You mean they really, the internet got crashed?
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.260]   Wow!
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.740]   Well, you know, the funny thing about the Onion
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.660]   is they also have a print version.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.780]   Yeah, I mean, like a print print, not just a webpage,
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.500]   but there's actually a newspaper.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.620]   Yeah, you can get it,
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.260]   they distribute it around San Francisco for one place.
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.100]   That's how it's started.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:32.940]   Again, it's great 'cause it's free.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.260]   You can just pick it up in all these restaurants.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.860]   Yeah, it's along with the examiner
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.580]   and there's the San Francisco Daily News.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.540]   We have like three or four free newspapers now
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.620]   in the Bay Area because, you know,
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.700]   the real newspapers can't make any,
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.820]   they're losing millions a week.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.660]   Yeah, I don't know how that is.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.900]   It's strange, but they are.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.460]   But the free ones are making money?
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.020]   Who knows.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.940]   Doesn't make any sense.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.620]   I think the Onion is making a decent amount of money
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.460]   just either.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.220]   The following is, the Onion is this,
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.060]   I mean, the Onion is,
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.220]   let me see if I can skip through the commercial.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.180]   It is brought to you by TLC's New Series,
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.940]   Billy, Billy, Billy,
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.700]   Billy, eat his commercial on his wits.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.780]   Never mind.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.460]   (laughs)
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.380]   I love this.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.500]   This is done like CNN,
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.300]   the graphics are big and big.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   As you may know, the entire internet has crashed,
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.660]   more now on our continuing coverage.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.020]   Welcome back to Tales,
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.820]   which is still emerging tonight about this evening's top story.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.260]   The government is still dealing with the repercussions
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.820]   of the fatal error message that appeared on millions
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.900]   of computer screens worldwide less than two hours ago.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:32.980]   And just moments ago,
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.060]   FBI officials announced that they had traced the crash
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.980]   of the internet tonight to this man,
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.500]   Eric Tipton of Wallingford, Connecticut.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.020]   Tipton said he had more than 35 windows open
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.460]   on his computer at the time of the crash.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.900]   He had been downloading the Yolotango discography
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.700]   from iTunes while streaming several YouTube videos,
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.620]   listening to an NPR broadcast,
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.380]   instant messaging his friends,
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.220]   checking three email accounts,
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.020]   talking on Skype and playing online poker,
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.820]   all while installing the latest version of Firefox
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.180]   and updating his system software.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.140]   - And you know what half of us have kind of done that.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.980]   - Oh yeah, that's what I love about the onion.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.980]   This is so well done.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.460]   And if you look at it, it's perfect.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.540]   I mean, it's a perfect parody.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.380]   It could absolutely--
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.380]   - Yeah, they do good work there.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.860]   I have to say, you know, the funny thing is,
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.340]   by the way, the funny thing is when he mentioned Firefox,
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.780]   I'm having more trouble with Firefox.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.860]   - Oh, it's very crashy.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.980]   - Two-point-- - And up my system, crashing.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.900]   - I actually am very disappointed with 2.0.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.220]   And they've sent me notes saying,
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.500]   well, Leo, what's wrong?
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.300]   Some of it is just the extensions.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.940]   You gotta be careful about what extensions you can install.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.860]   - I don't have that many extensions,
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:36.700]   but I'll tell you this,
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.540]   every once in a while there was,
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.860]   the system goes into a funk.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.580]   I go and I hit the control off the lead
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.780]   to look at what's chewing up my cycles,
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:43.820]   and it's Firefox.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.380]   - Everybody knows this.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.380]   It hooks up to some ad server or something,
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.220]   and then the next thing you know,
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.620]   it's just basically paying it constantly.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.460]   - And it didn't do that until 2.0.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.140]   Now, they keep putting out updates.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.300]   It seems like it's getting better,
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.820]   so make sure you're updating it.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.740]   - I wonder how many installs Apple's app Safari has
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.260]   on PCs since they released it.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.940]   - You know, that thing doesn't work.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.780]   - No, there's no point.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.620]   - I don't care what anybody--
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.740]   You know, you have the sites,
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.660]   like if anybody out there was Safari on a PC,
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.300]   go to the KQED Channel 9 website in San Francisco.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.540]   The site doesn't even come up
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.460]   because it's got whatever kind of JavaScript they're using.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.020]   It doesn't even display that Safari.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.860]   - No, there's a lot of sites.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:20.700]   - Safari is a complete disaster.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.780]   - No, don't blame Safari.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.420]   I don't know if it's Safari's problem.
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.260]   I think it's also, frankly, a lot of sites aren't well designed.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.660]   Google has never been able to get Google spreadsheet
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.980]   to work with Safari, but it's not that Safari's
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.140]   Safari adheres to web standards.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:33.980]   Doesn't work with Opera--
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.580]   - Web standards from the 40s?
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.660]   - No, actually.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.500]   That's the problem is that many, you know,
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.820]   Firefox and an Explorer, in fact, do things differently
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.100]   than the web standards.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:43.940]   They don't--
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.780]   - Do things differently.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.020]   And if you take enough, you look at enough CSS.
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.020]   - Well, that's the thing.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:48.860]   If you go to the--
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.860]   - If you go to the asset test.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.940]   - Try like the asset test.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.060]   'Cause that works on Opera and it works on Safari
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.380]   and it's the only two browsers it works on.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.220]   - Well--
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.060]   - The CSS--
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:57.900]   - All I know is--
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.820]   - You know, it doesn't make any difference
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.500]   when very few people are--
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.580]   - Well, I agree.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.420]   'Cause everybody's using either Firefox
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.380]   or any of the Explorer, so it doesn't matter.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.980]   - So, but the point is, is that, you know,
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.180]   all these things render differently,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.580]   but the Safari is the--
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.660]   I mean, I like it just slightly fast.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.260]   That's okay, but Opera's fast too,
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.060]   so I don't see any better than Opera.
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.780]   It just doesn't work on a lot of sites
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.820]   and what good is it to go to a user browser
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.380]   that works, works, and then all of a sudden
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.340]   you have to go load a different browser anyway
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.020]   because this one site won't even come up.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.860]   - Yeah, no.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.380]   You know, that's why I use Firefox everywhere
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.020]   because it at least has enough market share now
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.740]   that every site seems to work in it.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.380]   - Well, actually Opera's pretty good.
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.980]   - Ah, see, again, Google Spreadsheet
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.540]   will not work in Opera.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.380]   - Okay, well, so--
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.420]   - I really use Opera's a great browser.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.020]   - Well, I do, so there you go.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.820]   We are gonna--
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.420]   - Now all your money.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.860]   - I was really hoping to get Patrick on to explain
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.060]   where he's going, what he's doing.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.780]   He's having a baby, that's great news,
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.460]   congratulates him, Patrick.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.420]   - That his wife was.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.820]   - Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.140]   That would have been a big news story.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.300]   All this time, you thought it was a little extra weight?
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.100]   No, he's been pregnant.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.220]   Kat, oh, that's mean.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.780]   Oh, that's cold.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.860]   See, if he were here, he could defend himself.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.740]   - Has a barrel chest, too.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.780]   - And he's barrel chest.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:18.780]   What was it, Greg Brannon said he's the lunchbox crowd.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.860]   (beeping)
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.820]   What is that, Dong?
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.020]   Is that a bell?
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.540]   - No, it's a wine glass, actually.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.220]   - I was gonna say, do you have a Buddhist temple bell?
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.140]   All right, that's the time.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.620]   Round two!
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.460]   It's time for--
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.700]   - Round two!
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.620]   - And I must say, Devorak does look good in a bikini.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.020]   John C. Devorak is available on his blog
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.900]   at devorak.org/blog also writes for a MarketWatch,
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.500]   which is now a Rupert Murdoch company.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.660]   Congratulations, John.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.940]   - Yeah, Rupert, now you're gonna go shoot some hoops.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.500]   - Is this the first time you've worked for Rupert?
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.940]   - Yep.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.140]   And I'm a happy camper, now I've done everything.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.940]   (laughing)
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.980]   - He also appears in PC Magazine
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.100]   and is a regular, really the star of Twitter.
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.300]   So glad that we could get you, John,
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.300]   even though you have to run off.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.260]   Take that wine glass and imbibe.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.060]   (beeping)
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.860]   That's beautiful, that's better than a Buddhist temple bell.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.100]   I feel like meditating now.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.180]   - I keep it here now.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.580]   - I think it's beautiful.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.740]   David Prager is at revision three,
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.380]   which is about to rule the media world.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.740]   - I will try to do some good stuff.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.580]   - Thank you, David.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.500]   It's good to talk to you both.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.380]   We thank you all for joining us as a short twit,
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.980]   but we'll be back next week with a longer one,
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.700]   unless we're not.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.540]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.380]   Another twit.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.220]   - This is amazing.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.380]   - Is in the can.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:39.660]   Round the morning.
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.980]   Round the morning.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.220]   - All right.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.300]   I should have paid attention.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.220]   I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.060]   Too much work.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.820]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.540]   My server's completely collapsed.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:01.820]   So here's the deal.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.060]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.380]   but I have a hell of a time
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.540]   when blue screens like forget it.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.900]   I'm killing you.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.980]   Round the morning.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.660]   - Do it on the twit.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.500]   - Do it on the twit.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.500]   - All right.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.380]   - Do it on the twit, baby.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.220]   - Do it on the twit.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.220]   - All right.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.060]   - Do it on the twit, baby.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.900]   - Do it on the twit.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.900]   - All right.
