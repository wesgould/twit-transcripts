[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.880]   Hey, I'm in gadget now, but we-
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   What?
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   Going good.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.640]   Oh, actually that happened a while ago, right?
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   Yes, yes.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.040]   But I'm doing well.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.200]   I'm an old guy.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   I don't know.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.760]   I'm going to say, Devinder Hardowar is here.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   He comes to us from Bite Magazine.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   I love Bite.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   I do too.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   Who didn't?
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   And gadget, that's awesome.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   What's your beat in gadget?
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.480]   I'm kind of just like floating around and covering what needs to be done, but I'm really,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.520]   I'm doing a lot of stuff around Internet of things, still doing some mobile and New York
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.920]   startups, things like that.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   Far out.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   From New York, New York.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   Are you in Brooklyn?
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   I'm in Brooklyn.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.920]   That's all New York.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920]   Yeah, it's all New York.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.680]   Also with us, Owen J. J. Stone from Places Unknown.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.400]   Oh, look at that.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.480]   You look like a rap producer.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.400]   You should be in like the studio.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.760]   I wouldn't let me behind the wheel of any vehicle at the present time.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.960]   It's safer when I'm being chauffeured around.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.120]   It's just in the car.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.440]   Yes, in the car for Oh, doctor.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.000]   Good to see you again, Owen.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Welcome back.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.200]   He's wearing a vintage t-shirt from the old ask.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Oh, doctor.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   Look at that.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.400]   That's kind of on the Internet somewhere.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.320]   Also with us, Larry Maggid.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.240]   It is a Tuesday is what?
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.160]   Safe for safe kids, safe Internet day.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.200]   It's an Internet day at Facebook headquarters.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   Yes.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.840]   And we'll talk about that later, I hope.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.240]   I would love to talk about it.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   What is safer Internet day?
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.800]   Safer Internet day has been going on for 11 years.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.960]   It was started by the European Commission by in safe, a nonprofit out of Europe working
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.160]   with the European Union European Commission.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.360]   And it's now recognized in 100 countries.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.200]   And our little nonprofit, Connect safely.org that I co-direct, is the US host of it.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.800]   So we're having it this year in Facebook.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.560]   It's going to be streamed live starting at four 15 Easterns through one 15 Pacific on
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560]   Tuesday.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   Great speakers.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.680]   Kamala Harris, who's the Attorney General of California.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.240]   Cheryl Sandberg, who's the Chief Operating Officer at Facebook is speaking.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.440]   I'm speaking.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.800]   The president of the National PTA is going to be there.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.240]   Panels on bullying and trolling and harassment.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.840]   Panels on using technology to affect social change.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.640]   And then we've got a great industry panel with Facebook, Twitter and Google kind of
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.320]   duking it out in terms of their safety and privacy.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.000]   We've got 200 kids coming.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So it's going to be really exciting.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.640]   Lots of kids, lots of adults too.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.880]   Sold out, but you can stream it at saferinternetday.us.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.320]   So it's going to be a real fun event.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   It's our second one.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.640]   Last year we were in DC.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.720]   We had Chuck Schumer speaking.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.440]   But this year we got Kamala Harris and Cheryl Sandberg.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.760]   So it should be fun.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   Wow, that's pretty cool.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   Look at Cheryl Sandberg.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   That's great.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.480]   Yeah, no, yeah, it's not easy to get Cheryl Sandberg.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.960]   Even though it's right there at Facebook.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.560]   But this is kind of a celebration and a kind of an acknowledgement that the internet can
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   be safer.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.840]   It's not going to be perfect ever.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.360]   But we need to deal with trolls.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360]   We need to deal with bullies.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.800]   We need to deal with security problems.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.760]   We need to deal with all sorts of issues, privacy and connect SafeWeTries to do that.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.480]   And this is a day when we kind of celebrate it.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:10.120]   Saferinternet.org or go to saferinternetday.us or go to next safely.org either one.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   Sorry for internet.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.760]   Sorry if you don't want to say for internet.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.200]   Like devices you don't even think of.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.120]   I just had an incident with a child.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.640]   Someone asked me they had their 3D and the kid had went on and googled something and
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.800]   horrible, horrible things came up on their 3D.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   And they're like, how do I stop this from happening?
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   I don't know.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   You got to bring it to me because I wouldn't even think.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.520]   You were thinking Nintendo 3DS would be able to go to horrible, horrible sites.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   Anything that's connected.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   And it was horrible.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.760]   And there was no simple way to fix that.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   Wow.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.880]   The next thing I care for our organization is going to be the internet of things.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.320]   I mean, you think about it.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.800]   I'm wearing a device where my pulse rate is constantly being uploaded into the cloud.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.320]   Now I don't really care if anybody knows my pulse rate, but I should have the right to
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.080]   protect that information.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.000]   And it's going to get more and more invasive and we're going to get more and more information
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   about it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.480]   So we're talking to drone makers, thing makers, auto makers, all about how can we make sure
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.440]   that this next generation kind of web, I don't know, 4.0, whatever the heck it is, this
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.080]   next generation of technology gets born in a more secure and safe environment.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.760]   Lots of interesting things coming down the pike.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.040]   I don't know why, but for some reason I feel like a company like Facebook is only going
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.840]   to pay lip service to this for so long before they say.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.840]   Eh.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.880]   Well, here's the internet will be safest when it's all on Facebook, right?
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.400]   Well, then you just take over everything.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   Well, that's true.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.520]   That's one of the negatives to saying a safer internet is, well, the safest way to do it
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   is to have gated, you know, a community community.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520]   Exactly.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   Right.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.920]   And it's all, that's really safe, right?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.240]   But you know, the fact is that there's a business case to be made for safety and I think that's
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.920]   part of what we try to talk to these companies about.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.280]   You don't want a company or a service that is, you know, run by trolls or is occupied
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   by trolls.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.800]   So I think there's a little bit of a vested interest.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.280]   I mean, there's attention, there's always attention, especially in the privacy side,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.840]   but when it comes to security and keeping people from being harassed, I think it's in
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.480]   the interest of companies to do what they can and a lot of them do good work.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.640]   A lot of them, well, hey, what, did Costolo this week admitted that he said it's my fault
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.800]   that there's trolling on Twitter.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   Right.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.480]   I mean, that's a pretty interesting comment that he, I guess he admitted that an internal
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.040]   memo that got leaked for the verge.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.360]   But that's a good example where companies know they've got to do a better job.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.360]   Ask him.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.320]   I think if I make the analogy to a safer cities, you're never going to have a city be safe.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.560]   There's always going to be back, Alex.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.080]   There's always going to be dangerous things you could do in a city.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.120]   But the idea would be let's as a community kind of get together and try to encourage
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.880]   places on the internet where people can participate without fear of trolling bullying.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.720]   So when you say that, it's a system of, in Philadelphia, it was called Killadelphia,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.160]   they had more murders per capita than anybody else.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.120]   So what the mayor did was he put a cop on every corner for six months in all the crime
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120]   related places.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   So crime fell.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.560]   So the force being out there did it.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.920]   And AOL was known for chat rooms and little girls getting kidnapped and put on TV that
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.040]   all these guys are coming on to air while chat got smushed down.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.080]   So as soon as Facebook is known for a place to pedophiles go to pick up on children, then
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.920]   maybe they'll do something crazy about it or something with this bullying and gamer
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.560]   gate and all that kind of stuff.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.720]   Once it becomes mass media that, like, oh man, people getting bullied on Twitter, well,
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   Twitter better do something.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   So how do some grow?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   We need hamster, damn.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.320]   We were talking about the wire.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.280]   We need hamster, damn.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.080]   And once that's all fake for internet day, it's safer.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   It's never going to be safer.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   Safer.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.480]   And the fact is, you know, my space and Facebook already went through that pet of their panic
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.280]   a few years ago.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.520]   It turns out there really aren't that many predators.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.160]   They're there, but there aren't that many kids that actually get snatched up.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.880]   I'm glad to hear you say that because sometimes I think when, you know, you've really been
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.080]   big on safer kids and all of this stuff.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.480]   And sometimes I worry that there's this kind of panic being created that the internet is
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.800]   full of predators.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   Yeah, there it isn't.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.160]   We know that most kids were abused, are abused by people they know, by relatives, by friends.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.400]   You know, the most dangerous place for a kid at home.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   Home is by far the most dangerous place for a kid.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.320]   So if you want to keep your kids safe, don't let them go to the doctor, don't let them
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.000]   to go to school, don't let them to go to any place of worship and don't let them go home.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.160]   But the bottom line is that, you know, that kids, you know, there's been moral panics
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.800]   about predators and we had moral panics about bullying, then we had moral panics about
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.640]   sexening, moral panics about all these things.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.840]   And there are dangers on the internet, no question about it, even security.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.800]   I don't, I don't lose a lot of sleep about internet security.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   I know there are risks, but hey, if I walk outside, somebody could steal my wallet, break
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.880]   my window, not be down in the street.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.000]   There's no such thing as a completely safe environment.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And then in Philadelphia.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.160]   And I think even with the cops, I worry sometimes, we talk about a lot of this a lot on this
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.480]   weekend Google, because as you know, Jeff Jarvis is an advocate for being public.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.440]   And I'm kind of public myself.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.480]   And I worry that we lose something by trying to enforce privacy on the internet.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.040]   I think internet inherently is a public space.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.560]   And so to make the people who really want privacy.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.080]   Don't go online.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.440]   Well, again, I don't want to say that either because online is so valuable, but you have
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.040]   to understand you're really participating in a public space.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.240]   I mean, I don't want the public to be looking over my shoulder while I'm doing online banking.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   But you're right.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.600]   In Facebook, I just post everything to public.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.480]   I mean, first of all, I have no private life.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.360]   But second of all, I don't really believe that you could guarantee privacy on an social
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.880]   networking site, even if they've got great privacy told or even if they do.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.760]   You just can't trust them.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:47.360]   We know Snapchat people thought that their Snapchat images were safe and they were being
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.880]   stored and visible.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.080]   We thought that Facebook would honor its privacy controls.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.520]   Even Mark Zuckerberg was confused and had public posted publicly pictures that were
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   private.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.240]   And that's what I mean by not getting online.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.200]   I know a lot of people that just don't use Facebook.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.640]   But that's the wrong answer too.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   Isn't it?
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   No, you can still use the internet.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.840]   You can still Google and research and use the internet for what you want, but you don't
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.960]   have to put a picture of yourself eating a birthday cake and ice cream down your nose
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.120]   for everybody to see.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.680]   You can be selective about what you want to do.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.080]   If you don't want to be public, don't tweet out that you have to have a handstand on
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.680]   your butt on the corner.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.360]   So people can select and choose what they want if they want to be private.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.280]   You're what we would call a net native.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.760]   You basically grew up with the internet, right?
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.360]   Although I feel like I'm in a weird spot because I, for most of my life, I didn't have the
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.360]   internet.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.760]   I got it when I was around, well, I guess maybe half my life, half my life, I've had
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.760]   no internet.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.720]   And then my parents got like a 4886 and I got prodigy in the late mid 90s.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.080]   So I have the distinct memory of the world without the internet and I saw hopefully everything
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.080]   changed.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.920]   And it's a weird thing to notice just like how different things are now.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.880]   My kids, for instance, 20 and 23 have always had internet.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.840]   They've always, they were born in 92 and 94.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.000]   Internet has always been part of their lives.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.080]   And I don't think they think a lot about privacy and security.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.000]   I just don't think it's on the radar.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Right.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.160]   Maybe they think about it differently.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.840]   I think the thing we're really talking about is that consumers should have control over
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840]   what they're doing.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.120]   So, okay, if you're putting something online and you know specifically you're making it
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.640]   public, okay, that's it.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   That's the agreement.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.480]   If you said it to private or something like that, it would be nice if companies honored
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.920]   what they said they were going to do.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.240]   I think it's the obfuscation of what's actually happening with our data.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   That's kind of the bigger problem.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.840]   And the thing about your kids, Leo, I mean, I can't speak for your kids, but there's been
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.160]   a little research about kids in privacy.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.920]   It turns out kids actually do care about privacy, but in different ways than adults do.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.160]   They want privacy from their parents, from their teachers.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.680]   They still want some level of privacy and control.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.520]   They just don't have the same concept of privacy that a lot of adults would.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   But they think about it in their own way.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.720]   That's what Dana Boyd, who's done great research on kids in privacy, concluded is that the
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.240]   word even means something different to people who are internet users.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   No, sir.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.240]   Yeah, it was Dana's research that I was citing.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.560]   And there's a lot of really great data out there.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.960]   I'm actually pretty optimistic about the millennials and I don't know what the current, what we're
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.880]   calling our current teenagers.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   But I'm pretty optimistic.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.800]   There's sure a heck of a lot better than we were when we were young.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.520]   You know, the only way to really be private, in my opinion, the only way to really be private
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.840]   and to use the internet privately is to use encryption, end to end encryption.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.320]   And I'm encrypted.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.800]   What I send is encrypted all the way to the end point, whether it's a bank, Amazon, or
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.680]   an individual.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.840]   Then it's really private.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.120]   Even the NSA can't see it.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.400]   But I don't think my kids even are aware of the notion of encryption or-
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.240]   They need to be built into every service they use.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.080]   They shouldn't have to think about it anymore.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080]   They think about it.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.520]   It should be the service itself.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:55.120]   We've seen a lot of messaging clients, like FireChat, just really blow up because they're
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.120]   so secure.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.120]   So people do.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.080]   They know, oh, this is secure.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.920]   What's app just added secure?
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.120]   In fact, they're using the red phone stuff, right?
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.800]   Silent Circle stuff.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.160]   And do you think that people who use WhatsApp are aware of that and choose WhatsApp because
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   of that?
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160]   No.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.160]   It doesn't matter.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   FireChat or something?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   I think that's it.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   The service itself.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   You don't have to worry about your PGB key.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   You don't have to share it to somebody.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   Fire is a critical mess.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   It hasn't reached critical math yet.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.800]   You've got to be talking to Gmail, Yahoo!
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   Mail, Facebook.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.720]   Well, and, gee, FireChat was used not for encryption, but because it's a mesh system,
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.680]   it was used in things like the Hong Kong protests because you weren't on a public internet.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.920]   You were on a private mesh network.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   Right.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.680]   And you didn't even have to have internet access on your phone to use it, which I thought
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.960]   was fascinating.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.160]   But I don't know if it was the encryption that was really the thing that made people
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.160]   say.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.160]   Right.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.160]   I think I'm thinking of another service right now.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160]   There's text secure.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   There's quite a few.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.840]   The government has a company, a new company, Octavini.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.400]   He and Ladar Levison are doing dark mail.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.880]   Right.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.000]   What the name, even the name dark mail, I mean, that's kind of ominous.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.880]   You know, when I'm using Bitcoin to buy my drugs, I always make sure I'm doing it.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.120]   I'm not sure that my secure network is up and running.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   All right.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   Let's talk about it.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   Let's talk about the Silk Road, ladies and gentlemen, Ross Ulbrecht guilty on all seven
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.760]   counts.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:33.680]   I was accused on Twitter, the bastion of truth, of misstating what happened in the Silk Road
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   trial.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.480]   Last week we had the Nick built on the show.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.760]   Nick is writing the book, the Silk Road book, which has already been optioned for a movie.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.360]   It's a fascinating story.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.440]   Ulbrecht guilty on all seven counts of creating Silk Road, which was used was basically a
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:59.360]   black market for illicit products, chiefly drugs used, used toward, and it was a tour site.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:07.520]   And he was arrested and accused of being dread pirate Roberts.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.760]   Life sentence?
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:14.280]   That's the question that this article poses on the news B T C.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.760]   It might be crazy.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.280]   I don't think a life sentence.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.520]   I don't think a life sentence either.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.040]   I mean, there's been a lot of drug deals getting caught with a lot of drugs.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.760]   I'm thinking out life.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.640]   Life is seems excessive.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:33.320]   I mean, but at the same time, it's amazing that $200 million, that's probably what they
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.320]   could find.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.560]   That's probably what they actually could get a hold of.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.720]   Because once it gets to that number, you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.880]   But it reminds me of the things on P one Instagram saying, I'll post your weed on Instagram because
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.000]   there's a there's a drug raid.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.320]   They put up $350 million in one weekend, just surfing Instagram for people to post drugs.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.400]   I'm like, regular people have that much weed and drugs in their house.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.720]   And then they're dumbing out to post pictures of it.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   Right.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   Exactly.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.480]   So I mean, $200 million, I'm sure that's a drop in the bucket.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.080]   I mean, if they just want to Instagram, got 350 in two days.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:14.160]   So a very, very interesting and sneaky way to get your drugs delivered and keep it off
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   the books.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.760]   We'll find out May 15th.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.520]   That's when the sentencing happens.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.440]   The jury only took a few hours, which tells me that they were pretty convinced by the
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.000]   evidence against him.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.840]   It seemed like a kind of a tangled thread the FBI found his his postings on a forum and
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.600]   then tracked it back to his computer.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.680]   I mean, it was a very complicated thread and a technically very difficult thing for even
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.720]   a technologist to follow.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   I don't know.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   I doubt somehow that the jury had any idea.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.960]   We talked last week about the fact that neither side wanted a technically literate jury that
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:59.560]   they were hoping that the ignorance of the jury and technology would help them each side.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.520]   Turns out, I guess it helped the prosecution more than the defense.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.920]   I wonder how long that'll last.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.800]   Like sort of like just hiding certain facts from juries like that.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.360]   There was even a debate.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:18.120]   They're reading transcripts of posts and there's a emoticon, a happy face emoticon.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.840]   When they were debating whether that should be read in court, they went back and forth,
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.640]   finally the judge said, "Well, that's part of the message.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.560]   You have to say it, but you can't say it.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.680]   You have to say it in a flat voice."
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.680]   "Smiley face."
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.680]   "Smiley face!"
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.240]   All of the transcripts had to be delivered in a, they had to be read because they had to
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.760]   get into the record, but they had to be read in a flat neutral so as not to just lay it
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   crazy.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.640]   "Smiley face is now a word that's used in transcripts."
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.800]   Well, I think it's still, in that trial it was in the transcript.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:59.120]   It's still a question of whether that going forward, and we mentioned this last week,
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.680]   I served on a trial of one of the predators in the NBC Dateline.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.320]   Go ahead and know that.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.840]   Yeah, to catch a predator.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.080]   And I've heard a lot of chat transcripts read in a monotonic voice by a defense and
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   prosecution.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.880]   And it was really, and now I'm technically literate, so I knew what was going on, but
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.880]   it was really interesting.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.920]   And I really do have the feeling that it is an opportunity for the two different sides
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.280]   to slant it in their favor if the jury doesn't really understand what they're hearing.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.920]   Yeah, and if it doesn't work in your favor, then you could just appeal on basically that.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.080]   No people not understanding in your misleading information.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.080]   That's an easy appeal to get into the system.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   So, how did that happen?
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.080]   How did that happen?
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   How did that happen?
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.280]   The prosecution presented the judge through it out saying it's in trapmen.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.920]   We never even heard the defense.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   Interesting.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.920]   Interesting.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.920]   Very interesting.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.920]   And I think it was in trapmen.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.920]   A lot of time it is.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.360]   I was, you know, you probably all saw this TV show, the Dateline show where they got the
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.360]   guy.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.360]   Yeah, actually, right.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.560]   The guy thinks he's talking to an underage girl.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.960]   In fact, it's an adult.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.240]   They use a kind of an advocacy group to do these chats.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   There's a lot of...
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   It's called perverted justice.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.040]   And the person who ran it is now one of the security officers at Twitter, Del Harvey.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   You're kidding.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   Yeah, no.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.040]   And she's very proud.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.480]   Look, they were well motivated, kind of a sucky name, but well motivated.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.280]   Well, but perverted justice did is it really was in trapmen.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.720]   They would get adults and they would really try to get people in these chat rooms to talk
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   dirty to them.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.000]   And they would use techniques that no child would use.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.200]   It wasn't overtly like talk dirty to me, but they would use techniques that they knew
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.360]   as adults would appeal to some guys.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.080]   And I don't think a kid would talk like that.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.040]   So there was really a lot of question marks around their methodology.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:54.280]   But the fact that the Petaluma Police Department enlisted them to create this sting and then
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:01.200]   allowed NBC to pay them to film the sting, I think kind of the judge was a little disused.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.560]   You know, there was one case of a prosecutor that was caught up in a sting and he wound
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.800]   up killing himself when the cops came to his house.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.520]   No, when the TV crew came to his house.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.800]   The suicide and the cops really upset about it because it was not the way they would have
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.120]   done an apprehension with the TV camera showed up before the cops did.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.120]   Well, exactly.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   You know, it's crazy.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.120]   Exactly.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.520]   One person that you want is a cop, not a TV producer.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.720]   The trial actually I'm interested in seeing how something like The Good Wife will deconstruct
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.960]   this because that's a show that's actually done a great job of taking these obscure
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.480]   tech concepts like Bitcoin and the way Reddit came together to hunt down the supposed,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.280]   you know, Boston Marathon bomber.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.840]   That show has done a great job of like taking the legal questions and going the extra step
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.040]   and kind of looking at that in a really interesting way.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.760]   I said last week everything I know about law.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.600]   I've learned from The Good Wife.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   Exactly.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.200]   I guess I guess it's one step of the long order.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.040]   I don't know.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.440]   I don't know.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.800]   When we come back, Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC has said we are going to ensure net
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.480]   neutrality by invoking Title II.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.080]   We'll talk about that and a lot more to vendor.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.880]   Harder wire is here from Engadget.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.760]   Oh, doctor JJ O and JJ Stone from Oh, doctor.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.200]   Look at those shades.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:23.560]   Man, Maui, Jim's Maui, Jim's was the phrase I was I heard last night.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.900]   The blank grill.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.900]   What was it?
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.900]   Something like that?
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.900]   You give me the yeah, that's it.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.900]   You give me the blank grill.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.480]   That scares the hell out of me.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.080]   I don't know what you're thinking behind them.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   Thanks to grill.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.580]   That's what it is.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.840]   The OG Owen JJ Stone.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   Stop it.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.680]   No, he broke up.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   That ruins the.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.280]   Thank you.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:50.120]   And Larry Maggot is also here from CBS radio and connect safely dot org.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120]   No shades.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   I'll have to go.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.600]   You know, you look like Kurt Vonnegut.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.400]   There's no way I could think of you as intimidating.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.360]   You look like a cheerful and happy.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   Oh, get my bad side.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.360]   That's what I want.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.560]   I can be very grumpy.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.040]   Oh, if you're grumpy, you need a snack.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   It's nature box time.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.800]   My favorite part of the show.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.600]   We break out the snacks.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   Nature box.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.480]   Awesome snacks delivered right to your door.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.800]   You can get a monthly box of goodness from nature box and you'll feel good about it too.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.000]   For you, for your kids, we get them for our employees because these are nutritionists
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   approved.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.600]   Never artificial color, artificial flavor.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.520]   No high fructose corn syrup.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.520]   No trans fats.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.800]   Just good stuff.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.200]   Minimal processing and delicious.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.440]   This is the sweet blueberry almonds.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   Those are awesome.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   Have you had them?
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.440]   You sent me a box?
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.440]   Oh, I did, didn't I?
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   Yes, you did.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.360]   You were on last time we talked about almonds, sugar, natural flavor.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   And that's it.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.240]   And you know, delicious.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.320]   Or by the way, you can choose from sweet, from savory, from spicy.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.040]   They have snacks for dietary needs like gluten free or vegan snacks.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.080]   These are pistachio power clusters.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   This is the one.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   It's still in here.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.680]   This is the staff's favorite coffee kettle corn.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.960]   Yeah, aren't those isn't that good?
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.520]   Kettle corn with coffee caramelized popcorn Italian vistro pretzels.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.520]   So here's the, I'm going to get you a sampler.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.280]   I'm going to get you a sampler roasted Peruvian corn.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.680]   What are you eating there, Jason?
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.680]   What do you like there?
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   You know, butternum.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   Sorry.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   Those are good.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.680]   Those are good.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.520]   I'm going to have the Oceago and Cheddar cheese crisps.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.320]   I said, let's pass these around to our studio audience.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   That's good.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.800]   Because they're looking mighty hungry.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.120]   They're looking mighty hungry.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   All right.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.320]   Chris, come here hungry and we'll pass around.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.640]   Let's pass around those.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.080]   They could try the coffee kettle corn too.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.080]   Pass those around.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   You know, it's nice.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   These are resealable bags.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.520]   So if the studio audience doesn't, in fact, eat everything, we can seal it up, put it back
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.400]   in the box nature box.

[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.040]   I don't have any nature box handy, but I actually just, while you were doing that,
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.400]   the bottom went out to my cupboard, got some not speaking, maybe hungry.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   You see?
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   Thanks a lot.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   Yeah, you're welcome.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   Now I got another 20 minutes in treadmill.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Thanks, thank you.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   I ate all mine.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   Did you eat all yours?
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.000]   Did we send you a big box on?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.320]   You sent me a medium box.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   I did share, though.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.240]   I wasn't, I wasn't, I went over my friend who doesn't know that I shared.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.240]   You don't ever send me anything.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.240]   I'll send you, all right.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.400]   Put Larry down for a nature box to vendor to it.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   We got to get you guys to the next box.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   See, see Larry, you got to come on like I do.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.600]   You got to demand what you deserve as an individual.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.080]   And Uncle Leo will take care of you.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.840]   See, I put my glass on so I can be like you, Uncle Larry.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   I like that.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   That's good.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.840]   From now on, I lawyer negotiates every appearance.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.280]   So what do you guys think?
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   You like, is it good?
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   I don't know.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.280]   I'm eating peanut food.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   No, I'm asking you.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   I'm asking our fine studio.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   We got good studio audience here.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.440]   Lots of people from all over visiting today as we do the show.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   It's always nice to have it.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.840]   It was a very rainy day in Petaluma.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.000]   So now they braved the weather.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.840]   Tom Wheeler, who we thought was a henchman for the cable industry and the wireless industry.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.360]   John Oliver called him a dingo.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.800]   He said, you wouldn't put your broadband and the care of a dingo.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.840]   It's like putting your children in care of a dingo.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.080]   He was called all sorts of names.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.160]   I myself said he was a shill.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.880]   He is in the Hall of Fame for the National Cable Television Association and the wireless
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.200]   industry as a lobbyist yet.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:45.360]   In fact, I wondered why President Obama even appointed him to be the chairman of the FCC
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   given his background.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.960]   Yet he seems to have done the right thing.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.960]   He listened.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:55.280]   They got more comments in the comment period than any FCC issue since the wardrobe malfunction
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.960]   on the Super Bowl ten years ago.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.560]   And he has said now we've decided everybody seems to everybody but the ISPs seem to be
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:11.720]   behind using Title II regulations as specified by the Telecommunications Act of 1934.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:17.520]   Title II basically says broadband providers are common carriers and they are regulated.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.040]   They may be regulated by the FCC.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.400]   This has been the whole issue is that the FCC can only do what it's mandated to do.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.240]   Congress says you're in charge of this, this, and this and that's all you can do.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:36.120]   Initially the FCC last year issued what they called open internet regulations or rules.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.720]   Verizon sued, took them to court.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.000]   The judge said, you know, you're right Verizon.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.160]   This is not within the FCC's purview but he did.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:51.440]   Actually it was a judicial panel they did say but if you were to declare broadband providers
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:58.520]   common carriers it would be within your realm to tell them what to do.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.480]   And the FCC has been really trying to avoid doing this.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:08.040]   I think a lot of us were concerned that this might be a heavy handed form of regulation.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:17.320]   But Wheeler has said no we're going to use a doctrine called forbearance to enforce selectively
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   within Title II.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.200]   For instance we will never regulate rates.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.400]   That was one thing ISPs were worried about.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:29.520]   It's interesting if you read his commentary he did a piece in Wired last week and he actually
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.120]   pointed out that he himself ran a company that wound up getting shut down or basically
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.520]   being AOL with his competitor and AOL with on the open phone network at the time.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.560]   Because even then you could hook a modem to any phone line.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.480]   His company was on the cable system which was locked up.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:52.880]   So he actually made the case that having a regulation which required certain kinds of
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.480]   neutrality will enhance innovation even though the cable and phone industry is making the
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.720]   opposite argument they're claiming that regulation is anti-innovation.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.800]   So it was an interesting point he made, again he based it on his own company that was dealing
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.480]   with the cable industry that essentially wouldn't give him an equal playing field.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.920]   Whereas Steve Case had an equal playing field through AOL and the phone network.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.080]   Well I have to apologize to Tom Wheeler.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.280]   And I'm sure John Oliver when he comes back on the air will say I'm sorry I called you
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.760]   a dingo.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.080]   I'm sorry I called you a shill Tom you did the right thing.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.240]   I have to say when I read that he said we're going to use Title II.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.240]   I did go.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:39.360]   Because while this was something many of us thought needed to happen there is a real concern
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.840]   about government control of the internet.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.640]   We don't want that either.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.520]   Is this in the books or is this conversation?
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   That's a great question.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.600]   He says I'm going to say something to me doesn't mean anything until I see written down.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.560]   And somebody smarter than me comes back and tells me that it's something I should believe
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.720]   in because I'm not going to read it but I need it written down so somebody else can
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720]   read it and tell me about it.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.560]   So what he's done technically is recommend it.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.720]   The members of the FCC the commissioners have to vote.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:14.640]   He says I am circulating to the members of the FCC proposed new rules to preserve the
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.520]   internet as an open platform for innovation and free expression.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.760]   Do you just Congress have anything to say about this one way or the other?
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.560]   Well okay so what will happen first is the FCC commissioners will vote yay or nay.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.520]   I presume they're going to say yay because President Obama has said this is what he
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.720]   wanted and the chairman said this is what he wanted and I know several commissioners
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.600]   have said we'll support this.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.540]   So I'm going to presume it passes.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.200]   At that point those are official rules unless Congress overrules it.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   So Congress absolutely and by the way if you think the telecom and the wireless people
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.440]   had a champion and Tom Wheeler they have spent a lot of money on a lot of campaigns
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.840]   and they have many many champions in Congress.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.360]   So before you go saying he's not a dingo anymore just think of the common phrase of people
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.000]   who are skeptical about life.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.280]   The person who you think is the devil comes out and says I'm your friend I'm going to
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.360]   do right by you and you say oh thankfully finally you're going to do it.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.320]   We're going to write on his back pocket that people want to strike down the notion that
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   he wanted.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.280]   I just like to wait and see what he said was good and supposed to happen and for I go
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.120]   claiming he's not a dingo.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.520]   It does seem like politics right.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.120]   He waited until the time was totally pushing in this direction like Obama said it.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.720]   All the votes came in from consumers like oh maybe I can do this and not risk hurting
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.880]   my political career or at least what he was doing right now.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.200]   So I don't give him too much credit other than following where the tide was headed.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.880]   Also it's coming to your own Obama's last two years when Obama has grown a pair on a
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.640]   lot of issues and even though Wheeler doesn't directly report to Obama I think it's part
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:49.040]   of the administration's plan to finally do what it needs to do and if the Republicans
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.600]   want to counter it there were Republicans will counter it but it's standing up and doing
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   the right thing and we'll have to see what happens whether Congress does intervene
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.760]   because it is a political issue.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   Unfortunately there are there are D's and R's on both sides of these issue this issue
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:08.360]   but it tends to be D versus R not not completely but but there are some ideological questions
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.160]   involved in whether the government should be even to this limited extent regulating the
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   Internet.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:20.520]   I even feel like among among Democrats and liberal geeks there is some concern about
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.360]   you don't want government regulation government notoriously and it's been it was designed this
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:34.160]   way by the founding fathers is slow kind of you know technology adverse for good reason
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:40.320]   right but it operates at a different speed than technology in the Internet and so I don't
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.680]   think anybody wants heavy handed government restrictions.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.160]   We don't want them picking winners and losers we don't want them regulating content I agree
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.760]   with Wheeler that we probably don't even want them regulating rates if we have a free marketplace.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:58.360]   By the way and this is an issue that some have raised he uses the word legal content.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:03.040]   He said he says so this is what I am proposing.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.200]   I'm submitting to my colleagues the strongest open Internet protections ever proposed by
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:14.400]   the FCC these enforceable right line rules will ban paid prioritization and the blocking
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:20.440]   and throttling of lawful content and services some people have focused on that word lawful
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.640]   and said well that's a giant loophole for the copyright police to jump through for the
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:32.480]   music industry the television and movie industry to jump through to allow ISPs to block bit
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:39.880]   torrent for instance to do deep packet inspection to make sure that people aren't sending illegal
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.600]   content over the Internet.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:48.200]   Certainly the Snowden papers would be deemed as unlawful content.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.840]   The key leaks would be deemed by some as unlawful content so that's going to be interesting
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.000]   to watch how that plays out.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.920]   He says though he is making he is absolutely saying and you know he did this in writing
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:08.000]   on wired he's speaking to geeks when you publish an opinion piece on wired he says we
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.760]   will not we will not regulate rates there will be no tariffs no now this one I'm unfortunately
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.960]   I disagree with no last mile unbundling I that's something that that's a stop to the cable industry
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.760]   by the way last mile unbundling has happened in the phone industry that's why you can have
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.720]   many different Internet service providers over your DSL lines you can only have one Internet
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.760]   service provider over your cable line and that's the cable company Comcast time Warner
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.680]   that's unbundling he's and he's saying he's through that in there it's completely doesn't
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:42.200]   fit which of one of these things is not like the other no rate regulation no tariffs no
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.760]   last mile unbundling that's that's a stop to the cable industry saying don't worry guys
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:53.000]   you still have a monopoly which is one of the big problems frankly right now maybe steps
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.200]   I guess I mean what he's saying is I want to supply he says to preserve incentives were
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:03.480]   broadband operators to invest in their networks which means we still want you to make plenty
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:10.760]   of money on those networks right so I agree that the proof will be when the FCC steps up
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:18.080]   and says you knock it off we don't know for the first time they also mentioned mobile broadband
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.920]   which is something the FCC I think the last time we heard anything related to net neutrality
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.000]   was a couple years ago they didn't even mention mobile broadband at all and I feel like at
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.160]   that point they were cotowing to the wireless carriers who were arguing that you know what
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.200]   wireless is so strange and we have to regulate it more we have to like limit speeds that's
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.240]   actually something that could mean a lot for people and how they use their phones and tablets
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.560]   for the couple of next couple years if it actually happens but that was a bit of a shocker because
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:51.840]   even Google in a famous and controversial brief sided with Verizon saying no no mobile
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.240]   is different you don't have to have net neutrality on mobile and so that was the fact that he
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.440]   mentioned we're going to do the same this is mobile and cable was surprising but you
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.200]   know just to make sure that nobody listening is living under a full paradise none of this
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.080]   says that they can't raise your rates that they can't control how much data you get to
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.680]   use that you don't have to pay more for higher speed internet at home it's really all about
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.040]   content providers access to the networks and access to people's homes it really doesn't
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.400]   do anything to protect consumers against having to pay more as it is I pay far more for my
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.160]   Comcast build and my neighbor does because I have the highest package that they offer
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.560]   and my neighbor has a basic package so I'm already paying probably fifty dollars a month
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.520]   more than my neighbor and that doesn't go away network neutrality has nothing to do
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.520]   that's fine I don't think any I don't think I would want them to get involved in that
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.000]   no I don't just want to make sure people understand that what we really want I think
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.600]   we can all agree what we really want is for the FCC to foster competition right what we
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.840]   really want and then this is why the cable company can screw you is because they're the
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:01.320]   only choice eighty six percent of Americans have only two choices for broadband to phone
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:07.040]   company and the cable company and that's it right eighty six percent there is no competition
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.080]   and so I want to see what the FCC is going to do to foster competition they've already
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:16.040]   made noise that they're going to go and and try to overturn these rule these rules that
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:23.760]   prevent municipal wire municipal internet I found that's huge if they do that that might
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:30.040]   make a big difference plus the race the the broadband minimum right or they at least announce
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:35.680]   yeah twenty five megabits yeah down a lot of good news if we if it happens I feel like
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   things are moving in the right direction you saw the recent FTC decision that you cannot
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:50.360]   sell unlimited data and throttle it yeah and it's not a big deal that's a huge deal huge
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.920]   I'm unlimited and I rock about nineteen gigs a month and I get that stupid text message
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.480]   in the middle like oh we're about to throw you and I'm like oh what do you mean about
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.600]   the phone I'm paying for it and I mean I don't even feel the difference and the speed to be
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   honest with you but the fact that I get that stupid text message is really annoying it
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.920]   drives me insane that we're not understand right exactly how do you define the word unlimited
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   it seems to be pretty clear right yeah I'm not going to say hey I know that they hate
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.680]   me because no one else uses nineteen gigs on their phone hey wait this doesn't doesn't
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.880]   matter your PC they're not even gathering a computer with it you're actually using it
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.200]   on the phone yeah I think that's I think that's increasingly the case because people are watching
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.280]   a lot of YouTube I have a daughter's degree drive so she's in her Netflix and I have my
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.160]   own clouds so I download movies from my clouds like I have to say that has changed in the
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.880]   last year I mean it used to be three to five gigabytes was a lot yeah and if you use more
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.600]   than that you kind of maybe were a little suspect now I think you're not alone oh and
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:39:00.120]   I think a lot of people are using more than 10 gigabytes how much you use Chris he had
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:07.240]   his family had a switch to a 30 gig plan because he what 17 he uses 10 gigabytes a month yeah
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.960]   they do too it's their fault too I agree so AT&T just upped my plan from 10 gigabytes
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.160]   to 15 at the same price and I'm pushing up against it on some months depends on if I
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.440]   travel a lot I push up against it chat rooms is starting away and a lot of people in the
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.240]   chat room of course you guys probably are heavier consumers than most because you watch
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:30.920]   a lot of streaming Twit if nothing else nothing else if you stream to it on a high quality
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:36.000]   connection all day all night you're talking 30 gigabytes a month and stuff yeah yeah and
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.480]   yet we're talking wireless right now but my parents are actually one of the test markets
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:45.680]   for Comcast throttling on in-home broadband and it's kind of ridiculous like once they
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:51.760]   hit 300 gigabytes in their home they have to start paying another 10 bucks for every
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.080]   I think 10 more gigabytes or something like that wow it's a their bill has started to
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.000]   skyrocket because of that and they have to go down to like the business version of
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.960]   Comcast I thought you did Comcast stop doing that now they're saying they're testing Atlanta
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.080]   and a couple of them and still going it's really hard to get off into that program or
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.040]   do they force them into that no that's just that is there that was their home internet
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.640]   plan I think eventually they started testing that out so weird I remember when they were
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.320]   proposing 250 gigabyte per month caps and they were going to roll it out and different
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.760]   tested and then I heard Comcast say no no no that's not worked out but they're still
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.000]   doing it they want to if they want to offer that a great discount you know as an option
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.720]   you know hey 10 bucks a month you get a cap I wouldn't bind to the option but if they're
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.600]   forced into that it's horrible yeah it happened they didn't know why it happened I think
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.360]   they just started seeing the extra you know additions to their bill and they had to bump
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:50.640]   down to the business class version of Comcast internet which I think is only 10 or 15 megabits
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:55.560]   so they were at like 25 before I know a good realtor and for only 10 or 15 million dollar
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:04.800]   they can buy a house here in Palo Alto Atlanta so much cheaper yeah wow well again this this
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:10.680]   argues for competition because had they another good choice and in their high speed choice
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:18.640]   in Atlanta they could say well screw you Comcast I need Google I think Google we got to rattle
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.600]   Google's cage because initially they said Google fiber we're just showing what we can
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   do in Austin and a few towns in Kansas City and this city but they're adding cities and
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.720]   I'm wondering if Google's starting to think maybe this is a good business maybe gigabit
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.280]   maybe people do want gigabit you know it's interesting in the towns where Google fiber
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.560]   is like Austin all of a sudden time Warner and Comcast are saying oh we can do that oh
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:48.000]   we oh yeah oh sorry that's that's what that that's a competition you want that's you need
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.560]   somebody else outside of the box saying hey I put 12 eggs in the basket they're only giving
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.160]   you 10 and same price don't you want well who doesn't want to free it also solves but
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:02.360]   it also solves net neutrality because if Comcast is throttling your Skype because they have
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.600]   a VoIP solution you can also go somewhere else but you need more than two you need more
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.360]   than three you need a few and you need some upstarts you need companies like Sonic net
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.040]   we had Dane Jasper on Twitter this the founder of Sonic net talking in this debate over
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.840]   net neutrality and the guys like that want do they you know they want this if they could
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.760]   get into every house they are thrilled to say we'll offer unthrottled and the problem
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.640]   is that we only have two companies that run wires into your house right the phone company
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.920]   in the cable company so unless you do it wireless even if you have the deal that it was the
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.680]   what do they call the the carriers that work with the phone company that allow them to
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.720]   piggyback on the phone company's wire the NOs yeah even they have to use the same wire
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.440]   if you phone companies control essentially control the speed because that's why you know
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.920]   at that point it sounds like Chattanooga where they have established high speed internet
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:58.540]   owned by the city like it the city owns the wires and the water and then the and then
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:04.060]   Chattanooga says okay and and you know we'll manage the infrastructure and anybody who
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:09.820]   wants to become an internet service provider on top of this infrastructure can that works
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:15.460]   right and of course immediately Chattanooga the the big the big ISPs try to shut this
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:20.700]   down make it like privatizing the road system in every town right I mean we have certain
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:26.100]   things that we have agreed can be public and in fact doesn't la still own a municipal
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:32.460]   water and power I think LA you know the Palo Alto the water and power is all city owned
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.460]   and that's been that way forever and and you're going to tell us we can't have a municipal
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.900]   internet system why not it's an infrastructure so different than a bridge or a road or an
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:46.980]   electrical system look at this this is city wants Chattanooga gig dot com this is the website
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:51.460]   of the city of Chattanooga Tennessee your gig is here right here in Chattanooga one gig per
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:57.340]   second internet available to every home every business 150,000 of them throughout the entire
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:02.900]   community urban or rural business or residence I mean this is fantastic nothing with the
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.860]   Chattanooga and I'll be rich and well but here's an interesting point it makes Chattanooga
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:13.300]   a pretty desirable city doesn't it does it's good for business it's good for real estate
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:18.860]   it's good for everything it's an open platform and of course the first thing Verizon and Comcast
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:24.740]   try to do is shut this sucker down that's why that we need that's why we need it so badly
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.500]   because for Google and their whole I want to make a social network and do all this to
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.500]   all the little companies are trying to build a choir and steal just roll this out you will
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.980]   make money people need television people need internet and people are desperate for another
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:42.220]   option in so many cities people in San Francisco out where you live they hate everything about
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:46.460]   the internet that they have to use and that's the mecca of internet and computer and technology
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:52.540]   and it's just evil out there and it makes absolutely no sense roll it out make some money I think
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:56.180]   I know it seems just very difficult right because Verizon announced a couple years ago
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:00.540]   that they were going to stop rolling out the fiber installations right if you have if you
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.380]   have Fios in your neighborhood that's pretty much it it's not going to get much further
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:08.620]   than that and if Verizon you know but one of the biggest mobile carriers and one of the
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:14.100]   biggest ISPs in the country can't even roll out more fiber or choose is not to I don't
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:19.340]   know how a smaller company will but that's what you have to ask why why did you rise and
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:24.100]   do it in the first place and why did they stop doing it and it's widely agreed it was
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:29.660]   a political move they never intended to roll it out everywhere but they wanted to curry
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:36.340]   favor with the FCC Verizon's been in a lot of trouble with the FCC so there may be some
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:40.860]   question about their motives from beginning to end on this I am thrilled that Wheeler
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:48.420]   has also said we are going to enforce rules of prevent municipal prevent legislatures
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:54.380]   from making illegal for municipalities to create their own Wi-Fi they're on they're
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:46:00.340]   on the verge of of killing that too and I state laws that would prevent municipal broadband
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:05.060]   like Chattanooga's and I think that's fabulous that's what we need that's what if the FCC
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.620]   continues down that road then there will be that I don't care about Comcast time Warner
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:17.260]   for rising in the rest they'll be competition yeah right we need competition anyway we're
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.140]   going to take a break come back with more lots more to talk about we got Larry Magad here
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:27.340]   safer kids that's his thing man it's safe kids not safer safe oh faith give calm safer

[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.940]   then she will break in that I'm gonna be all up in her grill so I'm not worried about safety
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.900]   because these other kids we got worried about on the 3ds's and the computers the parents
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.780]   open it's all about paying attention and I'll be paying attention I agree with you just
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:26.980]   to compute and you'll be wearing those shades is the computer in a public place so you like
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.700]   that's one thing that makes a big difference her her she has a MacBook Air of course because
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.540]   all my shoes go anywhere so she has a she has a MacBook Air she puts in her room when she's
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.700]   here when she's not here she leaves on the kitchen table so when she leaves out it comes
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.980]   out of her room onto the table right well our policy when well the policy we recommend
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:47.060]   my kids are grown up is it when kids go to sleep their devices go to sleep with them they
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:50.980]   not wisdom but you buy to go to sleep also yeah so you charge the phones in a central
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.260]   place of the house we used to say put a computer in the public part of the house but that doesn't
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:58.900]   work anymore because everything's mobile you can insist that the phones be charged at
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.060]   the living room in the kitchen or wherever you put them they shouldn't be playing with
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.140]   him and when they should be sleeping and by the way Leo that goes for you and me too
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:14.220]   we should know yes no yes no screen watch it disrupts your sleep there's evidence about
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:18.300]   that even if you're watching good stuff no means to throw up your sleep I like to check
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:24.140]   Instagram at four in the morning that's that's my right is it is it you you have the right
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.660]   you have the right to really feel just a little bit of music at night what is he gonna do please
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:33.320]   little you know even doing lately there's this app on Android and iOS called Pizziz PZ
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:39.860]   iZZ and you play it and it goes you're now relaxing and going to sleep you will have
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:45.340]   good dreams you will not wake up and go on Instagram and that's very relaxing but then
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:50.980]   I use headspace I use headspace to meditate believe it or I'm not in my life but I have
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.500]   this app that I got I think it's like 80 bucks a year after 10 free trials and it actually
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:59.740]   I don't know if I'm meditating but this guy relaxes me right he talks in this really calming
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:04.140]   voice and tell me to breathe and and by the time he's done I'm kind of half asleep it's
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:09.660]   a gym membership for your mind exactly be careful with Pizziz because that's how I brainwash
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.060]   people I talked to them I know I figure I think you're doing all kinds of your bank
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:19.020]   I'll be empty I have an out of your my driveway yeah I think about an hour in they're going

[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:51.620]   the original keyboard cat. The days when the internet was young.
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:52:08.580]   I love keyboard cats. This is the first cat video ever. I think this was the first one
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:15.540]   to go super viral but there were plenty before. Thirty eight million views of keyboard cat.
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:23.560]   Wait a minute what the hell's going on now he's going dubstep cat.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:31.700]   Davendera Hardwar and Gadget.com our show today brought to you by Oscar a new approach to
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:36.620]   healthcare this is cool you know I think we got a problem in this country with healthcare
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:41.140]   and I think we need to modernize it and I'm very intrigued by what Oscar is doing unfortunately
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.820]   it's only available right now if you live in New New York New Jersey but if you live
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:50.700]   in New York New Jersey and you need health insurance I want you to check out Oscar.
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:55.340]   They make health insurance they have an app they make health insurance simpler more intuitive
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:00.180]   more human their IT the engineers used to work at Tumblr okay.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:05.700]   That's Spotify at Google so their websites are like slick and and usable they have these
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:12.900]   great apps part of their customer app they develop a personal timeline and I wish I could
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:17.940]   do this I love this that lets you track your medical history over time so your doctor your
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:23.020]   appointments your visit notes are visible on there your prescriptions if you do phone
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:27.380]   calls with your doctor those are there you can of course use it to find doctors and care
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:32.580]   in your area you can search by location languages spoken hospital affiliation iOS right now
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:40.660]   androids coming soon they recently launched this is cool a misfit fitness tracker and
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:46.460]   it provides financial incentives if you are active it pays you so if you reach your daily
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:52.540]   step count you get a dollar a dollar once you hit twenty dollars you can cash out with
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.780]   an Amazon gift card you can keep doing this until you hit the limit is two hundred forty
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:01.380]   dollars a month a year so much money and claims they're paying themselves they're paying themselves
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:06.620]   because you know doctors as much it's a great idea it's so brilliant I you know health insurance
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:11.900]   there are a lot of health insurance their goal is just to palm you off like put off your
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.660]   illness because they know you're gonna move on and then just we don't want to keep you
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:20.140]   healthy we just want to keep you healthy while you're our customer and then it's okay
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.180]   see I think what we need is health insurance companies should also have to be life insurance
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:28.420]   companies I agree if you die I have an investment in you so this is brilliant Oscar really wants
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:33.020]   to reinvent this I wish we were in California New York and in Jersey only their plans include
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:37.260]   free checkups some free generic drugs free primary care doctor visits you don't need
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:42.540]   a referral to get care Oscars doctor on call gives you access to a board certified doctor
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:47.980]   twenty four seven just kills me that can't be a customer but if you want if you are in
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:53.380]   New York and New Jersey high Oscar dot com slash twit or call eight four four Oscar twenty
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:58.900]   five that's toll free eight four four Oscar twenty five sign up by the 15th you'll be insured
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.260]   by the first of the following month so that that works out pretty well is it open enrollment
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:09.820]   now I think it is high Oscar dot com slash twit or call eight four four Oscar twenty five
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:15.180]   and get the misfit fitness tracker but it's only for Oscar customers they're making waves
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.300]   out here I had a friend who's in New York who was unhappy with their health care provider
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.620]   and they asked to and I'm a I didn't know Oscar Oscar and look it up because I'm already
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:27.300]   good for the moment but I saw like 12 people put in Oscar so I was like yeah he must be
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:32.180]   doing okay so we love most of our advertisers are like this where they're taking existing
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:37.460]   businesses and using the internet to kind of reinvent it yeah and that's to me one of the
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:41.820]   most exciting uses of the internet here is just to kind of break down everything start
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:46.020]   over let's start over and rethink all this stuff I started shaving with Harry's I mean
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:51.300]   you know it's it's great I mean I don't get paid to say this right I mean I buy stuff
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.220]   from them but it you know it saves me money and they're there and they have great customer
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:01.460]   care I call them up in this late this lady named Kate who tells me to shave really you
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.900]   call and you say how do I shave Kate you know I wasn't sure how you clean what's the best
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.980]   I snare still have to figure this out what's the best way to clean a razor like you get
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:13.900]   the hairs right in these little knees in the razors and I and she explained to me the best
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.620]   way to get the hair that it still doesn't work quite as well as well as well you put
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:20.980]   it you basically you put it so it's backwards so that the water goes on the back of the
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:25.980]   way you said high pressure water through the back of it but I do it in the bathtub now
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:30.020]   because I got really super high pressure but that's the one thing I hope Harry's if they're
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.380]   listening that they can figure out a way to invent a razor the dust they need like an
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:37.780]   eject button you push the button it ejects the hairs exactly and it ought to be out the
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.140]   nice thing is because Harry's blades and this is not a Harry's ad because they didn't mind
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:45.620]   that today but the nice thing is Harry's blades are less expensive so I just change my blades
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:49.900]   more often that's another solution right it's nice to have a fresh blade all the time by
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:54.740]   the way you have a lovely shape you look very nice and clean shave today thank you that's
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:59.940]   not Harry's haircut too yeah great haircut I actually can't blame Harry's for the haircut
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:06.580]   because I got it shaved once with a lady with a straight razor and that was that was really
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:10.580]   the best way to do it oh it's great it was like I was a pumpkin and she was carving me
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:14.740]   it was like and then what you don't know there's a whole bunch of stuff you learn when you're
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:20.900]   when you get your head shaped is that you can hear it it's because it's from bone conductance
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:27.540]   you really hear the razor scraping you I said this barber who had very different politics
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:31.300]   in me we get into these political discussion oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:37.780]   oh you like obama exactly no I always worried though that was good no I don't let him near
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:42.180]   my throat when I'm getting covered a straight razor I don't have a conversation about anything
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:48.340]   but I think I don't want to know you're a Steelers fan you need to focus I don't want
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:53.700]   to I don't hear anything about anything do not all I say oh and never go to a doc a barber
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:58:00.180]   who's a cowboys fan because you have been so relentlessly brutal to the Dallas Cowboys no
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:12.100]   no no hair cousin Texas never ever go to Texas again moving along apple tv apple is apple is
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:16.820]   apple is they've been this is an ongoing story but that maybe because of the sling tv
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:22.980]   they have reunited apples conversations with broadcasters recode reports apple is once again
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:29.300]   talking to TV programmers about putting its own web tv over what they call it over the top service
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:37.380]   on apple tv it's over the top because it eliminates your cable television or antenna
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:44.500]   and you get your tv as you do Netflix now over the internet sling is offered the sling tv product
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:49.220]   we've talked about before twenty dollars a month you get a ESPN which means you get actual sports
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:55.700]   you get CNN which means you get actual news in your opinion okay all right you're right
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:59:00.900]   I'm sorry I was absolutely right zinger in there brother you can't just be throwing out
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:05.940]   so you're absolutely right like anybody watching anybody gets their news from tv is is certified
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:10.420]   nuts anyway right yeah I just know where now with brian Williams what's this with
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:16.500]   right oh yeah he broke my heart I love brian was so much and now you your dad's a criminal and a
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:22.820]   whole person and the worst part is well he did it for entertainment the news is no no that's the
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:29.380]   problem true this is entertainment the news is not entertainment you you i think silly
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:34.740]   you should get your news from radio that's where you should get your news from from cbs news radio
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:40.660]   no but any i mean that's a little self-serving Larry but i actually agree with you but no what
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.540]   you really need to do is you need to get your news from multiple sources you need to email
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:48.820]   online thank god for the internet you can actually go to direct to i mean i feel like we get much
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:54.420]   better news now because we do that yes both of us who do get that well it doesn't everybody
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:59.620]   you're not everybody still not everyone yeah the older people in the world are setting their
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:05.780]   ways on what they're screwed anyway anybody over 50 how am i the minor anybody over 58
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.540]   it's screw trouble
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:14.260]   now now anymore whenever i read something i literally have to go to another news source to
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:18.420]   reread it to make sure it's even somewhat legit right because we'll just post stuff and it's like
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:22.340]   oh boo boo i'm like did jesus come down and write this on a wall for you because i don't
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.660]   see it anywhere else online nowhere else is sitting about this place and then even trust
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:32.100]   you know it used to be if you went to a trusted news brand you knew it was probably true and even
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:38.100]   there i'm not i can't think of examples well pryan williams is a perfect example that's nbc news
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:43.460]   else you expect them to be accurate and it is and whoever wrote that because you have to write
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:47.940]   statements before you say them out loud so the fact that you can literally think in a room somewhere
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:52.660]   to say well we were doing it for entertainment purposes how does someone in that room not slap
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:58.340]   you because you can't come out and say things like that like you have a oh god i'm sorry now that
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:04.180]   now that comcast owns nbc some of the charms making a very good point it's it is an entertainment
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.380]   network division okay so i actually do work for a news division i work for cbs news and
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:14.340]   the news division at least or in the radio i can't speak for television really does operate
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:19.380]   independently i mean we i don't know what happens at the at the board with you especially you're
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:25.940]   on the tiffany network you're on edward r morrows tiffany network and the level that i work at
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:31.460]   nobody tells me what to cover i mean nobody tells me what to say as long as i'm accurate as long
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:37.700]   as i'm well-sourced as long as i'm i'm not way out in left field i'm good and and it doesn't matter
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:41.460]   whether it's a company that cbs isn't suing or anything else i know there were problems but in
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.140]   the news division we haven't had that problem at least at least in the part that i'm at
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:51.540]   knock on wood i don't think it's going to last well just don't say it if you're doing for entertainment
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:58.660]   don't say it don't insult your craft but you understand that the internet natives this generation
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:07.460]   growing up uh basically has had to learn actually this is a good skill had to had to learn that you
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:13.300]   always look at what's the underlying motivation what's the slant where is this coming from about
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:19.220]   every news source everything and that's actually i think that's why the new york times and then
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:25.940]   nbc and the and this traditional news stalwarts are starting to fall because that skepticism which
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:30.420]   is needed on the internet is now being applied globally and it's right it should be it is right
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:35.460]   and everybody should be checked even even you and elio i mean everybody get checked all the time
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:42.980]   believe me i go home and yeah that's right right and and and uh and you know everybody makes mistakes
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:49.940]   uh you shouldn't lie but everybody makes mistakes and when i make a mistake i will correct it so
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:53.620]   here's a weird concept that most people would probably think it's odd i actually consider
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.740]   access to media to be a sacred trust i know that sounds very naive and i agree idealistic but i
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:03.060]   really feel that if people are taking the time to read me or to listen to me or to watch me i
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:08.020]   have a moral obligation to do the best job i can to be accurate to be fair if i have a conflict of
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:12.660]   interest to disclose it as i do because i admit that my connect safely is funded by some of the tech
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:18.420]   companies but that's right there in every article and you know as long as you do that then then you
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.740]   can sleep at night but anything short of that i think of the violation of a trust and i know a lot
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.860]   of people think that that's crap because they think the media is nothing but a big corporate
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:30.980]   business but maybe i'm just old and i'm a part of a dying breed but i strongly feel that way but
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:36.340]   you feel that way but do you think uh the Huffington Post feels away uh yeah speak for my friend Ariana
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:44.340]   yeah i feel like that that people who communicate on the internet maybe don't have that tradition of
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.340]   sacred trust actually you know that's your question about how people depends who the blogger is i
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.060]   mean there are many i blog for the Huffington Post there are many bloggers in the Huffington
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:55.380]   Post that really are great and there's some staff people who are phenomenal but when you have an
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:04:00.660]   open blog network you know it's an open blog and lots of people do it you think it's click it's
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:05.140]   click mania you know they write i feel like half the posts are written anymore aren't even articles
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:10.260]   are written they say something like oh so they're such died what do you think and they basically
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:14.420]   come out there i know four thousand people put comments on and click it click you didn't know
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:19.220]   a lot of effort you asked me a question how about this one i see you post 40 articles a day like that
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:24.260]   how about this one and i and i talked about this before the show a couple of weeks ago i wanted to
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:31.380]   know uh when the super bowl kickoff actually was so i google what time does the super bowl start
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:37.380]   that is an eye opener because what you get is a lot of sites including by the way the Huffington
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:45.860]   Post the i b times the la times who create bogus pages that tell you what time the super bowl starts
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.420]   that is not a new story they know they know what's going to be that people are going to be safe they
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:55.460]   know people are going to search for this oh so they create pages that will show high on google
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:05:00.820]   that you will click on here's the Huffington Post and then they put ads all over it yeah because
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:06.660]   there you don't need a news story titled what time does a super bowl start right that is not
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:12.020]   that is not a story you would see in the New York Times we're doing it wrong uncle leo we need to
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:17.140]   get on this ASAP well that was of course my first reaction is god damn it why don't i think of that
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.140]   well you know if i think i asked i asked by android phone i said okay google what time did the super
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:25.780]   bowl start and it told me three p.m but i wasn't sure what time zone i think but google was smart
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:30.660]   enough to know what i was in but i wasn't i wasn't i wasn't 100 sure whether it had been pacific
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.660]   eastern arizona you know what i you know what i tried for the first time last night and actually i
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:40.340]   was pretty impressed amazon's alexa you know the echo the thing that's in your house oh you got that
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:45.540]   the tube one of our editors Anthony Nielsen got one and mike elgin has it is house and is reviewing
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:51.700]   it we were over for dinner you know what it's pretty cool i immediately asked for an invitation
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:55.620]   because if you're a prime member it's only nine and nine bucks first of all the sound quality is
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:03.940]   good and alexa's pretty smart you can accent accent you can accent questions and and and and she will
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:11.380]   answer in a in a nice natural voice it didn't sound robotic it's like a little pal in your kitchen
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:17.060]   and you can ask them things like literally what time is super bowl start we asked how old is
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:23.540]   michael jackson this is a good one and it said well she said in a nice natural human female voice
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:29.300]   michael jackson died in whatever twenty two thousand ten but he was fifty when he died actually
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:35.140]   said he was fifty years eight months twenty nine hours and three seconds old when he died
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:40.100]   was very interesting it was uh i'm amazed that google hasn't done this
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:45.860]   and i when i first saw it i said this is stupid who would want this and now i want this in every
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:51.140]   room in fact we were all saying you know who should amazon should buy sonos those are the speakers
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:57.620]   that are in every room and build this into sonos and then as you walk through your life you go hey alexa
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.820]   and they would tell you smart house really smart house
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:07.860]   yeah 2001 space odyssey is here right google's mission was to put in your phone i think that was
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.980]   the thing and they didn't want like a separate device for i agree but i think they missed a
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:16.020]   book missed the boat because of it perhaps yeah i'm gonna have to see we'll see how many people
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:20.900]   outside of our bubble that would want to have that in our house so maybe but i think if you try
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.460]   it it kind of surprises you no no i i'm totally down for it besides the fact that i feel like it's
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:29.220]   probably gonna make my child a little bit slower thankful she has me that i'm a super genius i'm
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:33.460]   gonna make her smart but wait but she's saying wouldn't she i mean it's just like having you there
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:39.540]   she's hey daddy what times your super bowl start and you tell her okay so perfect example she does
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:43.620]   she's learning to read and write right so she has words every week now she has to form her own
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:49.700]   sentences what used to happen was she would ask me to reread her sentences i would help her and so
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:53.460]   i get out of dictionary or i pull dictionary up online and i'd make a read it and she'd understand
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:58.260]   it now do you know what i hear in the other room here okay google yeah how do you spell what's wrong
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:03.220]   with that okay siri because she's not looking at the definitions like i'd make her do yeah she's
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:08.180]   just getting a direct word and she's hit me completely jay you're just jealous because google is smarter
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:12.020]   than you are at least more knowledgeable you may not be it's yeah it's the end of the
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.540]   end of the more than you do let's face it it really does if i could if i could program google to make
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.860]   her read the definition out loud i'd be happy with google but google just gives the direct answer
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:24.740]   moves on i'm trying to educate i'm i'm they should have a google student mode
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:29.540]   oh that'd be awesome where it says well i'm going to tell you the answer in a minute but first do
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:37.460]   this math problem that's called dog say got that's her drunk tonight yeah google goggles their ex
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:43.060]   yeah anything to make them thinking more yeah so i'll tell you that i'll tell you how to spell it
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:49.300]   in a moment but first this word from the holy roman empire i don't know but she's so smart like i
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.980]   got mad when i first heard it i heard okay google how do you spell ancient and i'm the
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:56.340]   crown like wait what how long has she been doing because i was real is my mind she hadn't been
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:01.940]   asking me to help her when i'm homework in like two weeks and she had figured out because you know
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.260]   she'll ask me questions like how many people wonder what i'm like i'll ask but seriously i feel like
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:14.100]   this may be a a change in kind of a big change in how we think of knowledge that the facts
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:20.100]   because they're at your fingertips at all times are no longer important
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:24.580]   because they're commodities because you can get the fact you can get the spelling of ancient
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:30.740]   anytime you can get the definition of ancient anytime yeah and and so no memorizing all of that
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:35.380]   stuff is now no longer important i don't think that's such a bad thing and education schools need
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:39.460]   to need to adapt to that i mean if i were a teacher these days i would give all open web
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:43.780]   exam every exam i'd say don't tell me what year that we're is it knowing what question
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:48.020]   asking where to ask it more important tell me what why does it matter right you know what what
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:53.220]   why does it matter not not who it's not memorization it's thinking that we need to teach right yeah
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:57.780]   i mean and i think that that would be the way i would teach but they don't let me teach anymore i
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:02.580]   remember my my late father-in-law who we gave him an iPad and he was just he was in thrall he was
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:07.460]   he was a school teacher was a science teacher and he was enthralled by he loved it and he said you know
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:15.780]   kapurnicus spent most of his energy grinding lenses yeah and manufacturing telescopes so that
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:21.140]   he could observe the heavens so that he could figure out that the earth revolved around the sun
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:29.300]   nowadays all of the information that he needed is available without any effort he how much more
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:34.420]   can people figure out because they don't have to spend the time grinding the lenses and making
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:39.860]   the telescopes was an interesting insight a long long time ago i was a graduate to this is my
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:45.700]   dissertation back in in the e-80 right for a presentation it was a close you wrote that big book
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:50.500]   well it's mostly charts and graphs yeah i did i did it was itself but the point is that i spent
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.660]   most of my time in graduate school going up and down the elevator to get between the card catalogs
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:59.140]   and facts i don't know i don't i don't think i learned anything other than writing the elevator
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.660]   you weren't good at the elevator though i was good at the elevator i was able to turn you know
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:06.580]   crack crunch out a long dissertation but the point is that that the knowledge is so much
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:11.220]   easy to acquire now and that means we need to be smarter and how we use it let's let's use this
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:16.500]   learning thinking exactly do a decimal system yeah isn't that funny you don't need that anymore
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:22.340]   my alma mater at Yale they the beautiful library sterling library just got remodeled
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:30.020]   and what i remember that the the entire entryway huge acres was filled with card catalogs right
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:36.020]   they're gone it's couches and computer terminals and it's cozy places to read and study
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:41.060]   it's like i know i wouldn't recognize it there's no card catalog can you cuddle on those couches
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:45.140]   if you have a cuddle partner yeah that's good it's better than a card catalog
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:50.100]   lot come fear anyway yeah sure let's take a break come back with more
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:55.540]   defender we got to get you in the conversation just chime in don't let these loud mouths jump in
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:59.380]   very bold it's fine i like i like hearing what you guys are doing but you know to what you're
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:04.660]   saying about the way we're treating knowledge now for me i'm excited about like how this will
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:09.540]   unleash creativity in people you know everyone's pooping the fact that we're memorizing less but i
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:13.460]   yeah that could be a good thing if it kind of gives you something more interesting yeah learn
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:18.340]   how to think not to memorize right although memorization is fun learn instead of memorizing
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:22.020]   facts memorize a poem so you can have a poem in your head especially if i get older than memory
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:26.020]   failing anyway though there's a great role augmented there's an awesome
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:32.420]   ipad app that i really love that helps you memorize poems and it has like you know
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:38.420]   you're a better man than i am gungudin and you know and all you know i memorize i don't know if
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:44.660]   i still remember it as a mandius you know and it's like it just lined by line i we bring me my
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:50.260]   apex i want to remember what that app is but it's so fun my pipe bring me my pipe and my slippers
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:56.900]   i memorize all my poetry via two pocks on so uh well
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:02.180]   you know that's not bad music is the best way to learn uh poetry i hope i still wonder if i still
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:08.980]   have it on here it was such a cool app and and i think that's a fun thing to do of course i'm a
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:14.260]   little weird oh he brought me my slippers too thank you and there's my pipe okay now i'm ready
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:22.660]   wait you're a piper i was joking you do you know this is twit right right here reading sonnets
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:26.100]   in about a moment fiddlers three are gonna show up and then you'll be impressed
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:30.500]   government allow us to smoke pipes on on television oh we are not on television not on
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.740]   wheel television you know i had to take uh and you probably have to do this too for cbs
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:41.540]   the fcc exam that's right i'd take it yep every year we have to study for it go tell him that
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:45.700]   i pass it over here though they give you a powerpoint presentation i got a hundred percent by the way
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:51.620]   good for you they tell you things like what you can do and not do and so forth and then so i circulated
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:55.700]   to the staff because i said it was probably good idea for you to know like jason i sent you a copy
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:14:00.980]   it's good idea for you to know what the broadcast standards are because we try to hear to broadcast
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:05.540]   standards but just you know there's no fcc looking over our shoulder yet
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:12.420]   and yet right what are the common sense that's common sense yeah but there's things like contesting
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:17.860]   what's a what's a legal contest what's a lottery um and you know there's there's a lot of good
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.100]   stuff in there oh you know what the best thing is how disclaimers about advertising and plug
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:28.900]   ola so that that was good for instance you cannot lie when in endorsement that if you don't use a
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:34.180]   product you cannot on on the go on the radio and say i use that product really you get a huge fine
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:42.500]   how did i figure that out not police wise that'd be well yeah there's another zfcc have well the

[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:46.980]   you um self-driving cars always fun Google is developing its own uber competitor but that's
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:51.060]   okay because uber is developing self-driving cars they put a deal with starting melon
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:19:00.900]   to do self but so really here's the future 10 years out when you call a cab or an uber or a
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:06.660]   goober whatever google calls their goober would be a good name when you call it goober uh it
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:10.660]   you know it pulls up and there's nobody inside all right well at least we start to
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:16.900]   worry about somebody roughing you up after you're right that's true hey yeah baby yeah you want
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:22.340]   you're gonna go downtown you know what I mean you live here you live here is this where you live
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:29.700]   you got a boyfriend none of that um and so I think this is but do you think people are ready for
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:34.980]   this do you think not yet would you get scared if the taxi pulled up and there's nobody in it
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:38.980]   I'd actually feel safer if the technology actually worked because I would know the human error has
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.300]   been reduced yeah but it also depends on the interest on the on the system that they're operating
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:48.100]   and I get a little nervous about a self-driving car on the same highway as cars driven by human
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:52.260]   beings but ultimately I think it's gonna be a lot safer I'm actually looking forward to that I
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:56.420]   when I grow really old I want to have a self-driving car or at least a service that comes pick me up
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:20:03.140]   I'm Leo yeah I mean a Tesla give me a Tesla please why I will test out this self-driving thing I'll
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:09.620]   drive across the country oh I think you must understand Teslas do not self-drive I know but I just want
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:14.100]   to I just want to Tesla and I want to be able to drive it myself and have it somewhat drive for me
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:18.740]   while I'm in there being lazy I'm trying to get myself a Tesla don't worry about the facts okay
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:25.460]   this is America lazy actually Javindra didn't Tesla didn't they show like a car that would read speed
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:30.260]   signs and stuff like that I think they showed some basic technology like that and we know for a
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:35.940]   fact that they're actually working on more self-driving technology but what I saw it see yes this year
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:41.380]   was every car company is doing something that's kind of automated yeah so Audi is working on it BMW
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:45.620]   is working on it there's stuff on the road today like the parallel parking assistant so people are
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:50.180]   gonna get more and more used to it so I think in 10 years yeah the car pulls up in front of you
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:55.220]   you know to your requested uber or whatever people will be totally down with it so I recently
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:21:00.340]   had a chance to introduce the interview the CEO Ford because they opened up a research lab in
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:03.540]   Silicon Valley and you know they're no longer calling themselves an automaker they're now a
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:08.180]   mobility company wow oh wow and they you know and they even have research going on with bicycles
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:12.660]   and so the whole thing it's like like car companies are learning to be like like trans like
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.260]   remember the old days when we talked about a railroad and then the smart railroads became
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:21.220]   transportation companies the smart radio networks became media companies you know that's true clear
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:26.820]   channel who owns I do my radio show on the premier networks which is on my clear channel
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:31.140]   right no longer is called clear channel because that implies radio it's called iHeartMedia
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:38.100]   it's about media which is terrible by the way i hurt media isn't that it i hurt media is that
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.820]   kind of dated but the Ford is about mobility now they're no longer about cars and trucks and
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:47.140]   it's really smart i mean they've got to start thinking about how it is we want to get from place
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:51.540]   to place whether it's a bicycle whether it's a car whether it's a self-driving car whether it's
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:56.100]   you know helping on the back of a robot whatever it takes the car companies that are smart are
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:22:01.780]   going to adapt themselves to it hamster mh in our chatroom says i want a self-loathing car
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:11.300]   well it's when me driving it pointed i just hate myself to your heart media that's again my point
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:15.060]   of people sitting in a room not know what they're doing like that's a great step four years ago
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:19.860]   and i mean it's in the right direction four years when it was iHeartNewYork when it was that campaign
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:27.060]   i heart radio and i'm talking about heart signs on like your tumblr and the fact of liking and
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:31.140]   that's what i come from oh you click things alike you click a heart you like it i heart media they're
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:35.140]   gonna like it no dummy they're not gonna like it and you look like a six-year-old girl came out
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.100]   with this idea nothing against six-year-old girls because i'm sure there's tons of smart ones
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:42.020]   but once more to me i'm just saying in general you could be racist or unicorn radio
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:47.220]   probably a 60-year-old man that came up with the idea actually that makes it even worse
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:53.460]   there's a couple of people that's kind of creepy they sit around and who comes up and no one checks
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:58.020]   them no one says don't do that let's you're in the right direction but let's make it a little bit
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:03.540]   better there's two things i can't do and i don't know if it's because i'm a 60-year-old man or because
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:09.300]   i'm a man or what but i can't do the heart thing with the fingers every girl can do this i couldn't
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:15.140]   do the macarema back when it was popular i could not do it and i can't do the aww every girl can do
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:23.700]   that aww heart what are you laughing at can you do it you can't do it but you're a girl so not every
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:27.860]   girl can do it you are wearing a pink watch though okay i just want to point that out
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:32.740]   aww i hurt your watch i'm just not very good at that
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:43.460]   aww aww nothing huh no no i hurt media they need to change that again i know they just changed
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:48.500]   but some money is going to be i know it's it was like so weird i actually like clear channel better
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:53.620]   myself your channel is a great name that's a radio name yeah it really is well if it's a more
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:59.140]   than a radio name it's it's a it could be a channel and more than it's a clear channel and the
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:04.340]   problem is clear in present media yeah clear in present media i think i'm on some of those stations
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:09.220]   too and you know it's okay they're clear yeah we love them now we're not knocking them no sorry
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:15.860]   love that radio it's gets a future there it does and it passed too long past
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:22.340]   twitter has agreed reached a deal with google to put tweets back in google search i don't know if
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:28.420]   remember google used to have tweets in google search and then the deal and no one complained
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:33.780]   right nobody said oh gosh i wish there would be tweets in my searches again i'm sure they annoy
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:38.500]   me when i find them i don't want this to happen i'm not looking for tweets i don't want this to happen
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:43.300]   if i want to search tweets i go on twitter and i search exactly exactly exactly the search is
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:49.060]   terrible i mean you have to admit so it is a good issue like google search engine you know they
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:55.300]   can do that so they have uh so they've made a deal uh with google to get the what what's called
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:01.220]   the fire hose which is this we've been calling the fire hose for years but it's got to really be a
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:12.260]   fire hose now all this all the tweets from all 284 users just into into into the google search engine
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:17.140]   uh which means i guess i don't know i'm going to vote against this you're going to start seeing
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:21.620]   tweets sir if i if i google leo loporta i'm going to get everyone of your followers tweets
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:27.620]   they see that's what i'm afraid of that's why people use my name in vane well of course and i don't
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:35.300]   really want that i do not want to oh leo loport i mean i i figure google smart enough for that right
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:40.020]   but for me it's more like um if you want to look up something that's happening right now and there's
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:43.620]   no news stories about it yet you typically will look to twitter but twitter search isn't very
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:48.180]   good right so for me it makes sense having it all on one screen okay um you like there have been
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:52.100]   incidents here in new york where i see a car crash or i see like a street is closed down i'm like
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:56.740]   what is going on here and twitter is the way i figure that out but that's after a lot of like
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:02.660]   culling through junk twitter feeds and things like that so it could be good but it's true when when
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.940]   somebody asked me to do a celebrity die the i you know what the old days you turn on the radio
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:15.380]   when you turn on cnn no you just go to twitter right it's like so much faster sometimes the
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:20.820]   problem is with that too is i don't again i still need to go to some reliable source because i can't
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:25.540]   trust people's tweets i mean people pass around the onion post like it's gospel and then they
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:30.820]   realize it says the onion i mean i've seen people go half a day 30 comments deep and i'm like you
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:35.940]   notice is the onion right and then i delete all those people but i'm just saying like you still
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:41.060]   have to check from somewhere so right it's all about following the link though yeah yeah yeah
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.500]   are you still paying the five cent post office tax on every email you send
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:50.740]   including messages telling you all that's about to come into it and i knew that was true it's true
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:56.500]   twitter stock pops as company tops earnings expectations this is uh another twitter
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:00.980]   story i guess good news for twitter because for a long time the assumption was unless twitter grows
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:05.780]   at this same torrid pace with new users it's not going to do well in the stock market
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:11.700]   but because they they didn't grow as fast but their earnings were good this stock did well and
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:17.700]   that's actually a good a good thing for twitter because that was becoming a problem the issue of
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.700]   having to grow at this crazy rate they almost doubled quarterly sales
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:29.860]   like honestly the expectations for twitter was starting to worry me because i think you know
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:33.460]   of all these services it's probably the one i use the most in a line the most every day and i
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:38.820]   didn't want just to die in a year or two um just because it didn't get enough users but i think
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:43.220]   people are realizing hey they're actually making money so maybe let's not focus on how many new
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:47.460]   people they can add let's focus on what they can do with the people they already have yeah people
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:52.580]   were concerned because last quarter instagram actually surpassed twitter's monthly active users
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:57.220]   right and there was some real concern that this is going to hurt uh twitter it also is bad because
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:03.620]   it force it was forcing twitter to just do whatever it could to increase user growth which often meant
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:09.300]   the the quality of what was on twitter went downhill in other words yeah they were not blocking
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:15.300]   junk accounts spam accounts uh troll accounts because they needed the numbers and if the only
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:19.700]   auto-posting accounts i mean i'm flattered every time i write a column for the huffington post it's
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:24.260]   in a thousand people tweet about it but i wonder how many of those are bots that actually just
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.780]   automatically do that have you noticed what's happening to me lately is stuff
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:33.380]   i that happened a long time ago is getting retweeted yeah i noticed that too somebody just posted
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:39.620]   twit covers the apple iphone announcement so yesterday i had a i had a panic exploring it was a tweet
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:44.340]   that said that i was giving a talk at a conference and i said wait a minute i spoke at last year's
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:49.060]   conference and i said did i miss the fact that i agree to give this speech it turned out but they
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:52.820]   just today tweeted the fact that i'm going to give a few stuff about it vindry do you know what's
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:57.220]   that what's going on there i i think the bots are just getting they're trying to make their content
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:01.540]   look a little more real and for for the longest time we've seen them just like copying other people's
[01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:05.220]   posts and stuff that may be interacting with tweets is better for the bots i don't know i've
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:11.860]   never understood though why how this works you so what these bots are like tweeting normal stuff
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:17.540]   tweeting normal stuff so that you'll kind of uh trust them and then they'll put an ad in yeah yeah
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:22.420]   or they'll follow you or like they'll start you know they am mass followers in different ways so
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:27.540]   once those things get a certain amount they could be valuable for ads um you know think of like what
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.700]   people do with youtube when they just like upload random things they're just trying to build accounts
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:36.900]   user the answer to is there they'll tweet about content legitimate online content but they'll
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:41.700]   actually tweet to their page that links to the content so you'll write something for a legitimate
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:46.500]   new source they'll tweet about it and then you go to a page with ads with a link to that new source
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:53.540]   okay so yeah yeah the bigger point is like when you talk about instagram instagram went through
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:58.980]   and just demolished all those junk accounts like there were literally people that i was following
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:03.860]   and they're funny i don't know man how did they get 500 000 followers when they filled those things
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:10.420]   out i saw people with 500k drop down to 10k like oh yeah overnight so twitter doesn't do that though
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:13.780]   twitter's like oh well there's bots in their spam well we need those numbers we're gonna leave
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:18.420]   them the fact that instagram did that is shocking to me and in fact the twitter after that whole
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:22.740]   debacle of numbers and instagram's numbers aren't real they don't matter well twitter's numbers
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:26.740]   aren't real because the other thing those bots do is you go back to their page and yeah they retweet
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:30.740]   to do but they also retweeted 30 other people and then what do all those people do go back and why
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.420]   did you retweet something from 10 years ago and you like he said you click on you go back to their
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:37.940]   content or you see something else that might resemble something that's interesting to you and you
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:43.140]   click on that so they're they're dragging you in with this backwards stuff and it happens a lot
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:47.700]   like there's a lot like you know it's really strange that they don't cut those people out but
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:51.700]   again they need those people all right as long as they're not abusive they're not gonna just
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:56.020]   but the grammies are tonight okay are you gonna be sitting there with twitter scrolling while you
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:31:02.740]   watch the grammies i bet you are i do i need to ask that grammy and i also stick spam in there and i
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:08.100]   get people to one single click my stuff on amazon and send me presents i mean it's it's law and the
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.900]   grammies know i think live tv shows know when i went to twitter first thing i see is oh the
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:17.940]   grammies are tonight make sure you follow the official grammies thing and then i go there and
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:24.980]   look at all and by the way only 19 000 followers nobody follows them oh sorry exactly right i mean
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.740]   they really don't they follow the hashtags and apparently mashables done a deal with them because
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:35.380]   there's all these mashable branded images in there smart isn't that interesting very smart it's all
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:41.220]   it's all blending isn't it that's crazy it's more fun to watch these shows via twitter than this
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:45.060]   actually watch the shows you know while you're doing something else you could just see the updates
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:49.780]   so how many tell me how some companies that have no real reason to have millions of people
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:53.860]   following them suddenly have hundreds of thousands of followers may understand why leo
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:58.500]   has a huge amount of but i only have half a million the grammies has two million well but the grammies
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.460]   is a big deal but i'm talking about guys i could i know a consultant who is not very well known
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:08.100]   who has like 50 000 followers there's no way that he could have amassed that in a natural
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:12.820]   by followers he's buying let's you know a little secret is that people pay for them they really do
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:16.420]   and it's like people say to me all the time like when i go out for work because nobody really knows
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:22.100]   i do for a living but i'm a consultant so i hear this all the time well you only have 7 000 followers
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:26.580]   and i'm like i could whip out 50 those followers right now that have like a million plus followers
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:31.460]   and they're following me so the number versus the quality is a whole different atmosphere like i'm
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:36.580]   sorry i didn't go out and pay to get 30k fake people but you know it doesn't matter for a lot of people
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:40.340]   do that but i mean i yeah probably write that check but if that's something that you would you would
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:44.980]   feel good about i i have no concept to do that because my basic thing is when i'm trying to teach
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:48.820]   other people about the internet or show them what's going on the biggest thing for me is funny is
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:53.300]   explain something about how facebook ads work people want to dump all this money into facebook and
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:57.460]   buying likes for their pages and i'm like you know these are click farms and estan bull and then
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:01.940]   they still make me help them buy them and then after two months i go back and i show them like
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:06.180]   look they're not real and they're like oh well why didn't you tell me that more and i said i
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:09.860]   broke it down for you from the get go but in their mind they just want numbers they want numbers they
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:14.740]   want numbers yeah they don't care about writing a check but once those numbers do zero for you
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:18.260]   then somebody realized all right we're gonna stop writing these checks because it's useless
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:23.300]   so you gotta play the game right but it makes you think that's the problem too is like this
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:27.540]   obsession with numbers right the new monthly active users for me it's more like they need to focus
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:31.780]   on the service right because there is no feature parity across all these apps right the twitter
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:37.540]   desktop app on the mac can't i don't think it can play animated gifs yet uh tweet deck like hasn't
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:42.500]   had some features that have been all on all the other twitter things and it's been really annoying
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.980]   to have a service where it doesn't work properly across different devices because they don't have
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:51.300]   the time or inclination to actually focus on building those features i had to stop using tweet
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:54.500]   deck because of that because there are certain things that i want the consistency wasn't the
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:58.420]   same and it was enraging my heart i'm like you know i just quit i give up and i used to love tweet
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.660]   deck but for those reasons you're exactly right like focus on the people that you have
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:05.620]   and making them more happy because they'll go out in the venge last few and be like don't
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.300]   me want you on twitter and that's how you bring more people that's how it started it was an
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:12.900]   awesome thing that other people had to tell other people about you know what i mean like
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:16.100]   saying them with the grammys they're gonna be memes and jokes and how many people gonna be at
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:20.500]   their jobs tomorrow with nerds that don't have the internet and say look at this like oh really
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:26.180]   that's funny i can get there for free i'll go download this fam and then i'll do it but that that old
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:31.220]   school tells me to do something still works and they need to focus on those kind of things sometimes
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:38.500]   what do you really think the uh the now are the grammys live because i think they are now right
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:43.540]   because that was one of the problems was they were not live on the west coast and you couldn't go on
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:48.260]   twitter for three hours or that you would know what every so now everything has to be live across
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:53.060]   live right no no more delaying it for the west coast olympics are never live in the u_s_
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:58.260]   sip the olympics yeah but it's not like oh i can't go to three in the morning i can't go to twitter
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:03.620]   because i don't want to know when the biaathalon nobody's doing that or do her they some people are
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:10.580]   probably a very few um let's take a break come back with more to vendor hard-award from engadget

[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:55.300]   telling you about something that's awesome and if it's out of his voice you should listen to that
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:00.420]   tonight to go to sleep unclean i agree that's what is the it's his whole thing squarespace dot com
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:05.700]   you suffer go 10 for 10 percent off new weird ads it's like the amathy mcconnahay and uh lincoln
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:11.060]   that's right what is the story with that yeah just him expounding on philosophy and life it's
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:15.540]   amazing but by the guy the guy who directed drive also directed those people so it's like a really
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:19.940]   interesting vibe they have gone there you saw the saturday night live uh take off on the oh yeah
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:24.580]   the four guys about that when i went interview they see they love it they they're you know they're
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:29.460]   doubling down on those commercials so they're did you ask if they're effective apparently they're
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:32.500]   very effective i mean i don't know if they actually sell cars but they get a lot of attention well
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:38.100]   that's what effective would mean in my book well eventually because you know for those ads that
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:43.700]   you had on that we're very effective just saying intent you know when i see somebody
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:50.100]   spend like squarespace or for it spend four million dollars for 30 second on twitter i mean on
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:53.860]   the super bowl i'm saying you know if you spend four million dollars with us you'd be you'd have
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:41:00.820]   ads in 2020 you'd have you have ads for the next 10 years and you'd actually have people that show
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:05.220]   the functionality of the nicest that they have yeah i didn't have a lot of cool stuff i mean i just
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:09.780]   bought a new i bought a another car and i was looking at it for it and my biggest problem was
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:13.540]   all the technology and stuff i had to go search for it by the time i got to the place right they
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:16.900]   didn't know what was going on and i'm like right i shouldn't be sitting in this car teaching you
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:20.900]   about this car and i asked to get two other people and they still couldn't do it i'm like you know what
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:24.900]   nevermind and there's nowhere online where you could just go they put in front of tv shows
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:30.340]   they're one small oh what address do i go to to they never show you what you really want to know
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:34.340]   and that's one of the things that's why they bought twit we were they were on twit for two years
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:38.580]   and then at the end of it they said well we're done i said oh but but we're doing great for you
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:44.660]   they said yeah but it was just a podcast we were just experimenting yeah that's all right they
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:49.380]   they pretend to be in front of things sometimes again you know what people who advertise like
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:53.620]   squarespace has been with us for four or five years people who advertise with twit squarespace
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:57.700]   credits us with putting squarespace on the map they know that it actually these ads really do work
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:02.100]   and and so i'm not too worried if for get something one of these days i was talking to somebody who was
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:10.180]   an ad manager for a proctor and gamble and he said we're starting to see digital media like
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:17.860]   podcasts but also you know banner ads so outperform our broadcast media for big brands and brand names
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:24.100]   like tide and that at some point it's just going to shift people are just going to say why buy a
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:28.260]   why buy a four million dollar super bowl ad you get a lot of i mean we've been talking about
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:34.580]   the super bowl ads you get a super bowl commercials dropping the hashtags so the folks in marketing
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:41.940]   land keep track of how many hashtags there were and in the 2014 super bowl 50 percent of seven
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:47.380]   percent of the ads had hashtags only 15 percent 50 percent this year so it just shows you you thought
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:55.940]   maybe hashtags were then were forever no good no yeah twitter had three ads mentioning twitter
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:43:01.700]   facebook ad four there weren't any ads mentioning google plus or pinterest or youtuber instagram
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:06.020]   however 28 of the super bowl ads did have just a hashtag
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:08.980]   twitter might say well that means us
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:14.420]   the rules it's just easier to find the conversations now you don't need the hashtag right i guess
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:18.500]   that's really true the company name or something yeah i guess that's really true and anymore to
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:23.220]   be honest with like my basic core like at super bowl what happened to me was i saw three commercials
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:27.460]   i instantly went to youtube to go find them and two of them weren't even on youtube yet which
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:32.340]   enraged my heart because i'm like what are you doing the i think it was the nissan commercial
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:37.300]   with the dad and race car driver i mean i put in every which word but loose and it wasn't online i'm
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:43.140]   like no you're a father your father is a girl that was my father i love my dad my dad was my best
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:48.900]   friend and i i'm a sucker for that stuff boy how about how about the dad how about the dad is driving
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:56.740]   his daughter to the airport to join the military hey god what i do is i go to the hashtag i can
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:44:01.700]   share it only times i ever use a company hashtag on twitter is when i have when i complain about
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:06.420]   them yeah i mean when i was i think that's the problem i use hashtag delta and what did i get
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:10.580]   service as a result of that but i what why else am i gonna i'm not they're not paying me to advertise
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:13.780]   why would anybody use it okay when you're watching the grammys
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:18.820]   okay that's a good time where the grammys should really say this is the hashtag you should use
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:23.380]   hashtag the grammar whatever it is because i want to know because i want to snark on the grammys
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:26.580]   and i want to use their hashtag right that was a problem with the super bowl the super bowl had
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:30.580]   three different hashtags yeah you need a common hashtag to come and ask me 49 super bowl 49 or
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:34.500]   super bowl there was three different so following i was like well what do i do is i just gave up after
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.620]   one of them that's an example so it's not the brand but the event you want the hashtag right
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:43.220]   it's not you know i'm never gonna hashtag Budweiser right smarty their beer
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:49.460]   however like this i would add that maybe they marketing land points out that snapchat for the
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:54.740]   first time ever featured in a super bowl ad the ad was for pitch perfect too so that's what the
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:59.700]   young people are you know that's a great movie early some new the first one was great love the first
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:04.580]   one love the first one i'm i'm embarrassed and say that i loved it i had a buddy hanging out with me
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:09.140]   and he's like don't be embarrassed i'm like dude i was so i told him for two days when
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:13.060]   road trip and he's like we're watching i'm like we're not i'm not doing i'm not no and he put it on
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:18.180]   i'm like oh and he's like oh you like it don't you're like yeah and it got me and i was horrible
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:20.180]   so okay so just so can you do the heart thing
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:24.340]   ah so okay love
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:27.780]   yo
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:34.020]   team mobile of course uh hashtag uncarrier they did a lot i think that work that worked
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:36.820]   that worked for them i think yeah that worked for them yeah
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:40.260]   avocados is that they can tell you who not to follow
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:44.180]   on twitter right you can see who the marketers are it's like oh i don't i don't want to see what
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:48.340]   you're doing okay i love the avocados from mexico they had the first draft ever members like the
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:54.020]   prehistoric times and they had the draft remember that ad but their hashtag first draft ever i
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:46:00.820]   bet you there was not one tweet with the hashtag first draft ever but one right why would you you
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:06.500]   why would i tweet about why let me tell you something i didn't see any of this because i died so i
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:11.300]   didn't get a chance to see any of the show or the half what happened you died yeah you come back
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:16.660]   commercial that's the nationwide commercial oh that's the worst oh i died so i didn't get to see
[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:23.460]   as i think i died oh man it was uh as people like oh who don't want to see serious karate i'm like
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:27.220]   now you know that it was just serious it was like i was trying to like like this little kid he's
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:31.780]   wearing a tuxedo and i'm like why does and i finally realized like oh he's he's on some six
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:36.340]   sense stuff like i see dead people and then once i realized i'm like this is sad and i was watching
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:40.740]   the game and i was happy and i was drinking and now i got a kid that i'm worried about a tv phone
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:46.900]   on her and that's not cool my favorite one it became a meme so they got their mileage out of it
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:51.300]   but there was a lot of like uh internet meme pictures with but i died my favorite one was
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:58.740]   i would have given the ball to marshall lynch oh yeah but i died i didn't see that one too
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:04.260]   i saw before i saw the ad i thought what did i don't get it and then i saw the ad and i got it yeah
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:09.540]   that was a creepy ad but you know what they may have got it toyota did anybody tweet with the hashtag
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:17.460]   one bold choice no i mean i mean i shared it but i didn't i i have a teddy look at that
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:25.860]   bmw hashtag hello future i think that i don't think that's original yeah well last year what car
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:31.300]   coming was it was a maserati had like a spot and people were like well why do they spend money on
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:35.540]   that i was like because people that drive maserati don't really need commercials my
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:40.180]   free to put that to you i remember when i bm was selling a multi-million dollar mainframe on the
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:44.420]   supergo i'm trying to figure out there's ten people who would buy such a computer they're all

[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:55.780]   microsoft super bowl ads which were very touching the hashtag empowering not one tweet not one
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:48:02.020]   tweet within power oh hashtag empowering radio check once we'll end with a sad story you want to
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:10.580]   end with a sad story this is sad we should have a uh rip rip radio shack uh oh when i was a kid i
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:15.780]   used to go in there i'd buy one cable i buy one switch it was a guy who worked there actually
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:20.740]   knew something about electronics you go in there now and it's just a miniature best buy it's it's
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:25.220]   it's not what it was when i was a kid my dad worked for a drator shack and let me tell you it was
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:31.220]   like the coolest thing in the world i thought i was so cool like i put those i put those oversized
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:36.580]   headphones on and i mean i'm in there jamming listening to be like blow my i just remember sitting
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:41.140]   there blow my ears i listen to music and my dad actually helping people solve problems
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.940]   you know i mean like people will bring things in there and he'd be like okay you need this
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:48.180]   to need that and they buy it he'd open it up put it all together for him so he'd take it home
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:55.220]   plug it in and like that one again with a very good radio show two words oh he was two words battery
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:49:01.140]   club and that was good here yeah i was good yeah but that's why they went out of business because
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:05.700]   you bought one switch somebody else bought a battery i mean it's no yeah and and and and oh
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:11.620]   and dad spent three hours explaining how headphones work yeah it's not a business it's it's funny
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:17.060]   it's not a business model i as as a person i i that one thing i saw the page is like
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:23.300]   43 things you could buy at radio shack in 1980 or now on your cell phone it's like oh radio shack
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:28.420]   i feel so bad for you they put grandma the pastor forget about talking a lot
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:32.900]   we cannot understand why skime all died right skime all nobody needs skime all that doesn't
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:37.620]   be printed or but radio shack that was like legitimately useful and it shows the failure
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:41.300]   of the imagination of the company not to like i agree everyone wants gadgets now everybody
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:45.860]   wants tech it's the hottest thing around how do you not make that work and these aren't big stores
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:51.140]   these are tiny stores you actually couldn't work it feels like to me like book shops closing like
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:56.180]   books independent bookstores closing all over the country because this was the one place in almost
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:50:01.940]   any town in america you could go and buy a resistor sure you know or and they went to the model of
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:07.380]   selling lower end things instead of moving to the higher end thing remote control trucks and cell
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:11.860]   phone yeah right i bought my first cell phone from radio shack and it was like 600 bucks
[01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:16.420]   like now they're like they sell everything and it's the worst of everything you could buy like
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:20.180]   they don't have any current i don't know if it was a safe imagination of what you're saying but
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:25.220]   i feel like if they made every radio shack a maker space writing that can they talk about that
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:28.340]   they were going to do that and they never really followed through on that they did a deal with
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:33.700]   makerfare but they never really followed through on the opportunity idea yeah and they could have
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:41.860]   caught a tiger by the tail uh smartwatches are being banned from universities because they're
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:49.460]   worried that kids are using them to study what i mean she don't say oh geez study cheat this is
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:54.340]   small difference you study ahead of time you cheat during the exam is that how it works
[01:50:54.340 --> 01:51:00.740]   yeah i'm studying during the exam that's all the exam next thing universities are blocking right
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:05.780]   because when i was in school they didn't allow us to have our laptops uh you know they're during
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:10.100]   class although now and that was like ten years ago now everybody has their smartphones out probably
[01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:14.100]   taking notes on their smartphones well they and they ban smartphones and so the next step of course
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:19.300]   ban smartwatches because sure what they need to do is change education so that you're testing
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:23.860]   i agree at the post-type memorization and then you can have all the smartphone if you want we
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:26.980]   want to talk about it we talked about it you're absolutely right it's crazy it's crazy
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:31.300]   hey if you missed anything on twitter this week boy you missed some good stuff let's take a look

[01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:59.220]   a press conference in san francisco but nobody knows for sure what they'll be talking about it's
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.100]   unlikely that the company will be launching smartphones officially in the u.s market this week then on
[01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:09.060]   friday the thirteenth google and toymaker metel are holding a new york city event to announce
[01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:14.100]   products they've been collaborating on i for one i'm hoping for a new glass hole barbie
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:19.780]   that's what's coming up this week back to you leo glass hole barbie i didn't know to
[01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:24.340]   it with a color i'm gonna have to get me one of those he left out the most important word in living
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:28.340]   color yeah because i i watch it on a on a mac sc i think yeah i don't know you don't want to
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:34.180]   see black and white you lose all the fun g yeah radio shack going out barbie's going out of style
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:38.340]   so maybe i'm gonna radio shack and buy me a color i am intrigued what could metel and google be
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:43.300]   doing and the fact that shalmy is having a press conference in san francisco this is a company that

[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:56.900]   but it's a lot of fun is that a movie or is that a tv show jupiter since you would use his brother
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:55:02.820]   movie oh i love the wachowskis yeah they're their vision is always too far ahead of like
[01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:07.300]   what they can actually put together but i love their vision so it's great is that the one where
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:13.940]   an Hathaway's an astronaut and everything blows up and then George Clooney comes and
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:17.620]   this is chanting tatum this is a whole bunch of those it's all of that together
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:23.060]   chanting tatum is a space wolf hybrid man it's great i don't think can't take him's credible in
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:27.860]   the future i was gonna see the movie but it got such bad reviews and i wanted to see it's so bad
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:33.780]   i want to ask i think it was a big dumb movie yeah big dumb sci-fi it's so good it's not meant for
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:37.780]   anybody who's not a geek who else isn't that chanting tatum and chanting tatum milakunus
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:43.060]   shots right milakunus is in that yes any red mane isn't it uh who just played steven hawking
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:48.740]   he was so good in he is in the theory of everything he's chewing on the the cedar in this movie like
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:55.300]   he is amazingly campy it's fun he transformed into steven hawking in a way that was so incredible
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:56:03.300]   yeah that it was amazing uh just phenomenal all right jupiter rising ascending ascending yeah
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:10.020]   i love the watch what chow skis so i will go see uh that for sure because they're
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:14.740]   if you if you don't like it but i think it's a lot of what was their last or was she did a cloud at
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:19.860]   lists a couple years ago cloud atlas was good it was really good but also super ambitious and
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:24.660]   nobody saw it so that's kind of i had read the novel and i love the novel and i thought mmm
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:29.060]   this would be interesting to make this into a movie and it was about exactly what you'd expect
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:34.420]   like what the hell is going on here actually the movie was more intelligible than the novel i
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:39.300]   have to think i think so actually for me usual yeah that's because they could show the weird
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:48.820]   tattoo or birth point that all these people oh doctor you are i'm a man who loves you uncle leo
