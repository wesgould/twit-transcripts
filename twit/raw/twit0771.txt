[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.520]   We'll also talk to Mike Elgin, Dwight Silverman,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.200]   Jiffy or is it Giffy sold for a huge amount of money to Facebook. Why?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.880]   There's the US government about to sue Google for monopolizing online ads.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.920]   What Apple's AR glasses might look at and then a close-up look at Unreal Engine 5.

[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech. Show where you cover the weeks. Tech News, Dwight Silverman
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.320]   joining us, the tech burger himself. Actually, you're on HoustonCronicle.com/techburger B-U-R-G-E-R.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.200]   But then I think of you as a burger B-U-R-G-H-E-R like the mayor of the town of Techburger.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.360]   So you think I should add a redirect for Techburger with the H? Yeah. That's what I'm saying.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.640]   Hey, Dwight, in the Houston Chronicle building for the first time in months?
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.720]   Yeah. Definitely. It is very quiet. We've been away since March. I've been working at home
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   since then. It is really, I like working at home normally. I don't like working at home under
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.200]   these conditions. But it's really good to be back. And it's pretty empty here because everybody is
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.920]   working at home. Even our copy editors and folks who lay out the presentation.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.000]   What we do as bloggers and as podcasters can be done at home, but I always think of a newspaper
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.280]   as a big room with people yelling and running around and banging on typewriters. And then, of course,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.600]   in fact, Jeff Jarvis tells a story of he was there to computerize. I think it was the examiner
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.560]   because they had still had typewriters. And they brought in whatever the first computer
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.240]   system was. But even then, you couldn't go home and do it. You had to come in.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.200]   And we do our business, working the business news section. We have
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.400]   weekly Zoom conferences. Do you file like a Word document? Then the typesetters get it?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:29.760]   No, no. We use a content management system called CCI. It's based out of Europe for print.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.160]   And then we have our own proprietary software for doing web stuff. And so everything is just
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.200]   done kind of in this one thing. And you can do it from anywhere. It helps to be able to collaborate.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.280]   But even, like I said, even the people who do page layout are able to.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.800]   That's one of the things that's really changed. And this quarantine would be a very different
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.640]   experience. But so many businesses that traditionally have to be performed on site,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.240]   like a newspaper, not anymore. Right. And but you know, one of the things about the Houston
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.840]   Chronicle is we have been through enough hurricane that we know how to kind of do this. And so it's
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.480]   just like a permanent ongoing hurricane. Yeah, we were a little better prepared because of the
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.320]   fires in Sonoma County last couple years. Right. Right. Mike Elgin is also here. He's grounded
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.560]   for the time being our gastro nomad stuck at home. At least you kept the chef with you.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.920]   Yes, absolutely. And yeah, my wife has been cooking up a storm and it's been actually great.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.840]   So we've been in order to keep myself from gaining weight. We've been doing massive hiking.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.160]   So lots of eating and lots of hiking. So you had gastro nomad experiences planned at
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:52.080]   gastro nomad.net. Yes. Are they just all called off or? We postponed two or three of them. So
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.200]   Provence has now been booted to next year. The one that was already scheduled for next year is still
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.800]   on. So we're going to do two Provence experiences next year. We're still shooting for a couple of
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.040]   European experiences this year later in the year. And you know, they're opening Italy
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:15.280]   on June 1st. And so this is a great idea to be honest with you. But okay, I'm not sure I'd
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.760]   well, I'd rush en masse to Italy right now. Well, the place where we do the experience is
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.120]   actually a farmhouse on a mountain. The nearest neighbor is about a half a mile away. And the
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.480]   second nearest neighbor is like three miles away. And then we go to people's homes. So we go to
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.200]   instead of going to a winery in a tasting room, we'll go to the winemakers house and do tasting at
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.920]   her house. And that sort of thing. So we are it's a most of our some of our experiences,
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.280]   especially the European ones, Provence and Italy, they're already kind of socially distancing
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.640]   oriented already. So I think we can, I think we can do it. Plus people are dying to travel. So
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.680]   I think I think it'll happen. You know, I know he won't do it if it's not safe, but it sounds like
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.160]   it's possible to be. I do fantasize about like moving my quarantine, just picking it up and
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.600]   putting it so maybe that's that's the that's what you offer an alternative. Exactly.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:23.280]   Exactly. Exactly. Also joining us, Brianna. So now we're going to have to change your lower third.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.360]   Yeah, I guess we are. I got a depressing email from you last week. You've decided to call off
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.560]   your campaign. I did. You know, I'm running against incumbent and it's just not possible to
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.840]   beat someone that's been there for as long as Stephen Lynch has been there. If you can't,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.480]   if you can't knock on doors, if you can't hold events, if you can't give speeches.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.640]   One of the things with digital is you're essentially talking to people that already support you if
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.800]   you're holding digital events. So I just didn't feel good about, you know, using my, you know,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.240]   my supporters money to support something that I didn't feel I had a mathematical chance of
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.080]   winning. So it was the hardest thing I've ever done. It's hard throwing away three years of work
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.520]   because we had all the other pieces of the campaign in place. We had a killer field team, but,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:24.480]   you know, it's just this coronavirus. I could not ethically put my team in a position where they
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.320]   were risking their lives. Yeah. Rightly so. I understand it's, you know, we got to challenge
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.400]   in general because we've got a big election coming up in November and it's going to be,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.200]   what happened to the primaries? Are they all just canceled or? Pretty much. Yeah.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.360]   We were like in the middle of this gun hole primary season and then they just flat line.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.280]   Just over pause.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.520]   Well, it's kind of a relief, isn't it? I mean, how many more debates can we? I know. I know.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.880]   I'm all debated out. Yeah. Could it could have actually stopped about five debates earlier?
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:06.720]   Yes. Maybe. Okay. The tech industry does not slow down. I thought when we, you know, we started
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.480]   sheltering in place two months ago. Oh boy. You know, I don't know what it's going to look like
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.520]   in two months. There'll be no stories, but you know what? The tech industry seems to be going
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:21.200]   gung-o. For instance, this week, Facebook announced its buying. Is it Giffy? Giffy?
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:28.080]   I still don't know for Giffy. Giffy? Giffy? It's Giffy. I'm calling it Yiffy. Do you mind if I
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.520]   go like Yiffy? Giffy. Giffy. Giffy. Giffy. It sounds like we're all having seizures.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:41.040]   I think Giffy would call it Giffy because, because Giffy actually ran a series of, I don't know,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.960]   promotions or something a while ago, where they basically said it's the, it's the
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.720]   GIF that keeps on giving. They were doing puns like that, which indicated that they use a hard G,
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.920]   but that's just one day at a point. I don't think this will ever be resolved.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.040]   In the meantime, like if you're going to spell your company named G-I-P-H-Y,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:06.240]   you're asking it to be called Giffy. Yes. Yes. Wouldn't you spell it J-I-F-F-Y?
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.920]   No, because no, no, no. It's a pun. It's a play on a GIF, but it's a GIF. Oh, I don't know.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.600]   Anyway, so you think the company calls it Giffy? I do. That's such a terrible name.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.480]   I'm glad they got so. Now they call it Facebook. Yeah, so it's interesting because
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.760]   does Giffy have any way of monetizing? I mean, they're everywhere. They're on Twitter, they're
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.640]   on Slack. They're, of course, on Facebook, about half the traffic, according to Axios,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:42.080]   for a GIF he comes from people using Facebook, searching for animated GIFs and then using Giffy
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.520]   to put them into their messages. That's the primary use for it. I suppose they might make a
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.560]   little money selling special GIFs when the next Star Wars comes out, something like that.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:59.120]   But it really is, there's no ads in Giffy, is there? I think they're on there.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.320]   Yeah, they can go to the site. I think there are. On the site, but no.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.000]   Oh, yeah. On the site when you create it, but it creates the content.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.560]   No. It's 90%. I guess 99% of the users are just doing it in the keyboard.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.840]   And even Apple's messages, you search for GIFs and that's GIFs.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.520]   That's what you're going to get. That's where you're going to jet.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.360]   By the way, very popular, they said that they have 300 million daily active users.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:37.440]   So it's a lot of people use it. They must have huge expenses. Why, then, is it worth,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.560]   get ready? 400 million dollars to Facebook.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:50.320]   Here's one thing to consider. When you are sharing GIFs and/or GIFs on Twitter, on
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.720]   Tumblr, anywhere, you will now be sharing a little piece of Facebook.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.920]   A little bit of you. Going Facebook. Going everywhere.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.640]   It's kind of like Facebook getting their claws into all the other social networks,
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:10.240]   because most of the GIFs shared these days are shared on messaging platform.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.480]   They're shared on Facebook or its competitors.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:20.800]   I don't know what exactly are they going to monetize it from a dollar and sense,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.640]   point of view, but it is a power play. It basically makes Facebook really ubiquitous.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.120]   I think it also tells you how valuable data is.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.040]   Really, you don't need to monetize, because what you're getting is now you know what Twitter
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.120]   users are doing, what Apple messages users are doing, what Slack users are doing.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.800]   You have all sorts of additional information. I don't know how much the Jiffy keyboard gives
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.080]   Facebook when you use it, but I'm going to guess it gives them more than just what
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.280]   Jiffy you searched for.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:01.760]   Also, they actually came in under their latest valuation. They just did a
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.120]   funding round that valued them at 600 million. So Facebook actually got a bargain.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.280]   I'm bargain. It also comes.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   It also comes.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.800]   But look at it this way. I definitely agree privacy and data has got to be part of it,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.200]   but it's also just a feature. I mean, whenever I'm forced to use Facebook,
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   you know, this is a method of communication. It's a great way to leave a fun comment or a
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.240]   sarcastic question.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.400]   Oh, I love it. And I think everybody loves it. In fact, it's the bane of Slack.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.960]   I actually had a yell at my team and say, "Stop putting animated GIFs in the freaking general
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.880]   channel. I can't keep track of what's going on." We have a GIF channel just for it. You have to
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.440]   have a channel just for the humorous fun.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:53.040]   Yeah, definitely. I mean, this way they can go through, they can put their moderation policies
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.240]   in place, make sure there's not stuff coming up that's inappropriate for different channels.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.600]   So I think in addition to the data, it's a feature. It's like when Apple tried to buy
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.640]   Dropbox, it's just something as part of it. Facebook can certainly drop this money. It's
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.920]   a no-brainer, really.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.360]   Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I'm just trying to make it be scary and spooky. It's going to be part of
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   Instagram. And it's a quarter of all traffic to Jiffy goes through Instagram. So it's very popular.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.360]   But it's not a unique feature. And I doubt that here's how you'll know.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.760]   If Facebook says, "Oh, no, it's unique," we own it. You can only use it on Facebook and
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.800]   Instagram in WhatsApp. Then you're right, Brianna. It's a feature that's so valuable.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.720]   They're willing to spend $400 million because people love it. And they're taking it away from
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.760]   Twitter and Slack and Apple and everybody else. But my guess is they won't. My guess is they'll
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.000]   make it even more available to more people. That costs them money. That's their lot of data.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.120]   That's a lot of servers. But it's also inbound data. And I wonder, it's kind of hard to figure
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.680]   out. But how much? Do they get location information? Do they get what do they get? If you're
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:07.200]   using it. Well, here's one thing they get. So one thing to consider is the fact that one quarter of
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.320]   Jiffy's traffic, you can't say it without being self-conscious. I know I hate this. I hate it.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.240]   Rename out one quarter of the usage of their service is actually on Instagram. So
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.080]   by buying it, Facebook is making sure nobody else buys it. So Instagram is currently heavily
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.360]   reliant on this service. And so they figure, well, let's just own it so that we don't have problems.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.760]   I bet it's used on Snap, which is Facebook and Instagram are there are tribal.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:44.320]   There's another service. But I mean, Jiffy is the main service that does this, right?
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:51.680]   Yep. Mike, that's such a good point too. Because the thing is I'm not a fair use lawyer,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.640]   but imagine if someone else bought this and cut off Facebook and Instagram's access to it.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.040]   They couldn't really go through and pull up all those movies and stuff as a giant company
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:10.480]   to recreate this data set very easily because it's user-generated content. So I would imagine,
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.360]   it's not like Apple Maps where they can go create their own thing. I think it's uniquely
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:24.640]   valuable in that way. According to the media post from the Jiffy company, their API will not go away.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.880]   Jiffy's Jiff stickers, emojis aren't going anywhere. We'll continue to make Jiffy openly
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:35.520]   available to the wider ecosystem. So, I mean, of course, the acquisitions, people always say
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:43.440]   stuff like that. But I'm going to guess this is valuable to Facebook over and above the value that
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:52.480]   of simply putting funny dancing bears in your messages. It seems to me often the case in technology
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:59.200]   that the silliest stuff is actually the most nefarious. The dark patterns show up as dancing bears,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.560]   more often than not. Maybe that's just me looking for a story. I don't know.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.080]   Facebook is launching a... In fact, maybe, Brianna, you were talking about creating a,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.040]   I think, absolutely should. I want you to encourage you to do this.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.840]   Maybe a political action committee on tech issues, since that's your expertise.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.360]   Facebook is setting up what the Washington Post calls a dark money
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:30.480]   group, advocacy group, in Washington called American Edge. Maybe they call it dark money,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:37.200]   because as you know, Washington Post's motto is, "Democracy dies in darkness." It's a non-profit.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:43.920]   It's... The setup allows it to navigate a thicket of tax laws in such a way it can raise money and
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:49.040]   blitz the airway with ads without the obligation of... And this is why it's dark money disclosing
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:55.920]   its donors. NRA does the same thing as an example. American Edge has a good name. It's like,
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.440]   let's keep our edge. Let's keep innovation. And it comes at a perfect time because...
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:09.920]   I read this story and I thought, well, that's the Washington Post. Rupert Murdoch's journal
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:19.120]   going after Google, but the Post had a big article that the US government is getting ready to sue
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:26.400]   Google. Justice Department State Attorney's General likely to bring antitrust lawsuits against
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.080]   Google, focused on the ad business. There's no love lost between the Wall Street Journal and
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:41.200]   Google. We know that. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and some other attorneys general are likely
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.800]   to file a case probably in the fall. People familiar with the matter said, focused on Google's
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:53.840]   online ad business. It's funny because we had a little bit hiatus in the anti-tech, you know,
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.480]   the tech lash because without tech, this quarantine would be a little bit tougher for everybody.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.240]   But now it's coming back. Or maybe it's just the Wall Street Journal trying to gin up some
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.680]   anti-tech sentiment. I think the New York Times also had its own separate report.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.960]   Did they? Okay. Yeah, it's typical Ken Paxton, who's the Texas Attorney General, who by the way,
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:24.880]   has remains under excitement, jumps into a lot of these. He was early on in the state,
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:31.280]   the attorney's general lawsuit, tried to block the T-mobile sprint merger. And he settled with them
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.800]   relatively early. He kind of pulled out of it after a while. It would be interesting to see
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:41.360]   you know, if there's something that Google would do for Texas or for him, have hit settling quickly.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.200]   Wall Street Journal says that the Attorney General, William Barr, has devoted considerable
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:53.600]   resources to the Google probe, continues to treat it as a top priority. They have a quote from him
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.280]   that says, "The Justice Department will make a final call this summer. I'm hoping that we bring
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.680]   it to fruition early summer," Mr. Barr said. And Brian fruition, I mean decision time.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.760]   Well, does anybody worry that this is just purely political?
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:17.120]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You saw the tweet yesterday from the president? The most chilling tweet
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:29.040]   ever from President Trump. He said that, yes, the Facebook, Twitter, etc. are run by far left
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.280]   people and we're going to do something about it. I'm paraphrasing. And so that is not good.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.720]   But the president will be saying that. I've long ago blocked his account. So let me see if I can
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:50.640]   find it. Yeah, I can find it. But yeah, it was a scary thing because it sounded like he was saying,
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.920]   we're going after him because they're propaganda for the left.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:02.000]   Well, I think that's what's so frustrating about this, right? Because I think all of us would agree,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.520]   we want regulatory oversight of Google's ad business. It's a fact that they've paid
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.720]   some of the largest fines in history in Europe. It's a fact that they've moved into anti-competitive
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:20.400]   behavior on many occasions. And even with Facebook, it doesn't surprise me that they are putting out
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:26.800]   something to formally advocate for themselves and to push Congress the way that they would want
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:34.240]   Congress to move. It's just so frustrating because we need that kind of oversight from the Justice
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:40.080]   Department. But because you have a president that's talking about it in such partisan terms,
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:46.800]   it really politicizes the Justice Department. And it becomes not about protecting people from
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.920]   what's effectively and advertising duopoly. It becomes just another partisan screaming match.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.400]   And that's what's disappointing about it. Yeah, because I think we'd all agree that some,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.600]   it's a conversation that has to happen. I mean, tech has gotten very big and there's some serious
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.920]   and legitimate concerns. Yeah. It's not that we're saying,
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.520]   oh no, it's wonderful and it's perfect. But it is a little... Why did you find it chilling, Michael?
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:19.120]   Well, he basically said that first of all, he characterized the owners, like he's hearing
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:25.040]   on the individual people who own the services and saying that their politics is far left.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.920]   Interesting. And indicated that he's going to do something about it.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.800]   So that's a lot of posturing. He's doing a lot of posturing lately. But essentially,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:45.200]   in political science, a conservative Republican is in favor of minimizing government
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:54.640]   meddling with businesses. In a fascist dictatorship, the dictator is interested in using the government
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.080]   to go after the people who own sources of content that disagree with his politics.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   That's the difference between a conservative and a fascist. That's one of the differences.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:12.240]   And so his statement, his tweet taken just by itself is the statement of a fascist dictator.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.400]   Now, this may appeal to part of his base. And he may just have been in meetings where they're
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.440]   talking about they're going to have antitrust effort against some of the tech companies.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.000]   And then he was responding to Michelle Malkin, I believe it was, who was talking about the
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.440]   leftist leanings of social media owners. And he was replying to that and said, yeah, we're
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.240]   going to do something about that. So who knows? You can't trust anything. This guy tweets,
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:47.600]   obviously. But taken on its face, it was just a horrifying thing to say for a president.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.880]   But so much of what he says is bluster. And so much of what he says is posturing and
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:01.120]   playing to a base. If any of that would ever come to fruition, I agree with you that it's
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:06.160]   kind of a horrifying statement on its face until you look at who's actually saying it.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:13.680]   And how often he says things like that that don't amount to much. Other than to
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.240]   rile his base, every time there have been serious hearings on tech issues,
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:27.200]   a lot of the Republicans try to hijack them with discussions of unfairness and social media.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:34.720]   And it's just that. It's a hijack. It's not a real issue. But it's something that they could
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.800]   use to get the base going. And they've got a base to get to the polls in November.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.960]   But Dwight, I'd love to add on to that. This stuff is, it's not just bluster. There was another
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.800]   story that came out this week that Google nuked their inclusion and diversity programs,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.360]   because they were afraid of these exact kind of characterizations from the conservative movement
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:05.840]   in this country. And to say, I'm pro diversity would brand you as a radical leftist.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:12.480]   Exactly. And I have worked with a lot of the people at Google. They've done the unconscious
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.960]   bias training. It's excellent. It's really good stuff. For me, it's stuff that made me consider
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.360]   some of my actions, because people don't know this. Women have the exact, it's just a 2% difference
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:32.640]   in unconscious bias against other women as men do. So this stuff, it's not just bluster. It's
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.160]   work in the refs. It's it's a refrained spell. I like that.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.760]   Work in the refs. I love it. Good phrase. Good phrase.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:46.960]   Just to be very specific about this tweet we've been talking about, specifically, he
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.680]   wrote the radical left is in total command and control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Google.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.960]   The administration is working to remedy this illegal situation, stay tuned, etc. So he's saying that
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.760]   for people to be in charge of Facebook, whose politics are leftist, is illegal.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:11.280]   That's what he asserted. It's illegal to be left leaning and own a company like Facebook,
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.400]   Instagram, Twitter, or Google. Where did he announce it? On Twitter.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:21.360]   Exactly. Right. He's very confusing. I'm confused. I'm very confused.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.240]   Twitter, which will not block him even when his tweets can be incitement to violence.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:34.080]   Where he tweets something that they would block if anybody else said it because it's
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:40.400]   scientifically unfactual about the COVID virus. But he is the president. And so I understand
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:46.640]   their point of view there that, well, he's the president. So you've got to let him tweet.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.440]   It's ironic. They should do to him what Facebook has done to me. So for many, many years, while I
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.880]   was still using Facebook and Instagram, I was a harsh critic of Facebook. And I ended up no doubt
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.600]   on some list that basically said none of my stuff is going to be widely distributed or can go viral.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.840]   So my Facebook post, my Instagram posts, just everything lands with a thud.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:16.320]   Because I am part of this. They had this whole group that was there to prevent fake news and
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:22.560]   terrorist content and all this other objectionable stuff from going viral at all. And so they lumped
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:28.320]   into that sort of anti Facebook people. And so that's what they should do to Trump. They should
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.200]   sort of let him say whatever he wants to say. It goes to the people who follow him. But
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.960]   don't let it be amplified by the mechanisms of Twitter.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.000]   But this is where you're talking about a shadow, man. We're talking about a shadow.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.080]   But this is see, this is where historically we're challenged by a leader like Trump. The press is
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.240]   also challenged because none of the norms that we have him in the norm would be no, no, he's the
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.720]   president of the United States. You should be able to speak to the people of the United States.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.640]   That norm, you'd be violating that with a shadow ban.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:07.040]   It's why this is so challenging for the press. It's why it's so challenging for Jack Dorsey at
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.840]   Twitter. What do you do? What do you do?
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   It also wouldn't work actually. You got a crazy grandpa and he's got a tweet. He's got a Twitter
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:22.080]   and he's not afraid to use it. It's worse than that because Trump is actually not all that effective.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.040]   If you look at the performance and engagement of his tweets on Twitter, what happens is all the
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:32.560]   media, yes, all the media picks up his tweets. And that's where it's amplified. It's amplified by
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.360]   the press. That's why we're always hearing about Trump's tweets. It's not on Twitter.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.120]   Point, I don't follow him because it's too upsetting.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:46.480]   I think that's a really good lesson. I'm going to say this and I'm exactly as guilty of it as
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:52.080]   many other people are. There's a certain tendency with Democrats that when someone on the right
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:59.920]   wing says something that's snorkeble, something you can easily make fun of. You don't on it.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:06.160]   You quote, treat it for easy engagement. I don't want this to be a political show.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:13.120]   But for some figures on the right Ben Shapiro, they really depend on that kind of outrage and
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:20.720]   snorke response to amplify it and help build their career. So I find that I try to be very
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:27.920]   judicious about which of Trump's temper tantrums that I amplify because in a way you're helping
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:34.880]   him win. And it's so difficult. Richard Stangel is a former He used to work at the State Department
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.320]   with John Kerry. He wrote a fantastic book called Information Warfare.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:45.440]   And he talks about, for many journalists, you go and you want to be an information idealist.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.560]   You won't believe that the best information out there, it wins, give people the best arguments,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.080]   let them make their own decisions. But the truth is in Information Warfare, we kind of have to be
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.840]   information realists and realize the effects of these things a lot more. And I just think it's
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:07.200]   a no win scenario. Facebook is trying to self-regulate they've created a,
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:17.520]   oh, you got already a laugh already a laugh. They've created a new board. They've really
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:24.080]   revealed the first 20 members of the new review board. Those 20 will then nominate another 20
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   for a total of 40. There, I think everybody would agree, a very good bunch, a diverse bunch, global,
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:43.200]   distinguished activists, as well as scholars. They are going to try to help Facebook solve
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:50.000]   the content problems, which is a pretty insurmountable problem. Hate speech, harassment,
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.240]   protecting safety and privacy. They say the board in an op-ed in the New York Times said,
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.360]   "We will make final and binding decisions on whether specific content should be allowed or
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:08.480]   removed from Facebook and Instagram." On the other hand, wired in its piece, this is Siva
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:15.760]   Vijayanathan, who I love. He wrote, "Facebook and the folly of self-regulation. He took issue. He said,
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.800]   'Only in the narrowest and most trivial of ways does this board have any such power.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.200]   It will have no influence over anything that really matters in the world. It will hear only
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.000]   individual appeals about specific content that the company has removed from the surface,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.600]   already removed, and only a fraction of those appeals. It can't say anything about the toxic
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:41.120]   content that Facebook allows and promotes on the site. It will have no authority over advertising
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.720]   or the massive surveillance that Facebook uses to make its ads so valuable. It won't curb disinformation,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:55.120]   campaigns or dangerous conspiracies, and on and on and on. It's an interesting idea.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:02.560]   I commend Facebook for doing it, but it's hard for any group of 40 people
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:09.840]   to influence what happens with a 2.5 billion user service.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.960]   Let me throw ice water on your enthusiasm for this.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:22.240]   So essentially, Facebook has put another football up for the press to kick, and we're like,
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:29.840]   "Okay, this time she's not going to pull it away." What they're setting up here is like he said,
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:36.400]   there's no power there. It's an advisory position. They're trying to make this committee as illustrious
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:44.880]   and as respected and balanced as possible so that they'll just go ahead and remove what they
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.760]   want to remove and not remove what they don't want to remove. On those cases where they
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.640]   remove controversial stuff that they want to remove, then they can blame these guys.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.960]   But the committee can say, "Well, they said they said." And then when they don't remove stuff that
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.560]   the committee advises them to do, they said, "Well, we have a business around, we have our own
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:08.880]   reasons," etc., etc. So it's just a fig leaf to get the press off their backs, which is their...
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:16.400]   Basically, their only goal here. It's also very, very narrow. They're looking at individual cases.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.600]   There's no guarantee that anything that they do is going to affect overall policy at Facebook.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.160]   What they're doing is they're essentially presented with a case, they look at it,
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:33.600]   rule X. There's nothing there that requires Facebook to pay attention to what they're doing
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.800]   in terms of policy. It's pretty much chrome on a car.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:46.080]   Okay. Well, there you have it. Did you want to say anything, Brianna? The laughs spoke volumes.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:53.120]   I don't really agree with the pessimism. It's down on... I would say it is a slight movement
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.240]   forward. I do like the fact that people outside the company are going to be looking at this very
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.920]   narrow case of things. I like the fact that Facebook has agreed to independently fund them
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   for a few years. I think that's a step forward. But is this fundamentally going to change the way
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:16.560]   Facebook operates? No. It really strikes me as when Uber got into the trouble with Susan Fowler,
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.960]   and they brought in... Wasn't it Eric Holder to look at the culture there?
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.840]   Eric Holder's law firm to look at it. They put that in every single press statement.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:32.080]   So they were using someone else's credibility to address a fault that they've had. Maybe that's
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.600]   too cynical a view here, but that's how I feel. That's exactly right. That's exactly what they're
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:44.400]   doing. Well, you got my hopes up for a minute anyway. I guess I'm going to yank that football
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.480]   away one more time. Let's take a little break. What a panel. I'm going to try to find more
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:57.280]   great deep, heavy stuff to talk about. But we may end up talking about Unreal Engine 5 as well.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.680]   Yes. Yes.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:05.440]   Rana Wu, back to her old role as a game developer. That's right. She's loving it.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:11.680]   It's also great to have you here. Is there... I mean, it's just @RanaWoo. Can we put anything else
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.840]   down there? You got lots of room on that lower third now. Oh my gosh. A former candidate for
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:22.800]   Congress, game developer, head of development at GSX. Can you go back to Space Cat Gal now?
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.200]   I don't think I want to. I think, bro, this is more professional.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.440]   She's got her real name for years on Twitter. She was Space Cat Gal.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.400]   That's it. Then the campaign said, you know, it'd be good. Oh, they were angry about that.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.680]   Oh my gosh. It'd be good for votes if you would use your name. It's like my team. They say,
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.840]   Leo, no one knows what a netcast is. Why do you persist? Just give it up, old man.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.560]   Dwight Silverman knows what a netcast is, but he probably... I do.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.600]   Yes. He's from the tech burger, Houston Chronicle.com/techburger.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.040]   It's great to have you in your soundproof booth at the E.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.720]   That's right. It looks like a sound.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.120]   How do you sterilize the egg cartons behind you?
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.640]   I just... I don't think I have to. I just won't lick them.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.000]   Okay, good. Good thinking. Good thinking. Yeah. Good thinking.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.600]   And of course, Mike Elgin, it's great to have Mike. I'm glad you're stuck at home. I know you're
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.800]   not, but I kind of am. We get more. Yeah, it's actually great. I'm with family. I mean,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   I'm very lucky. I know that a lot of single people who were quarantining by them.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.000]   Oh, that's gotta be so hard. It's gotta be so awful. So I'm just so lucky to be with a family.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.600]   You know, it's worse than quarantining single, quarantining with people you don't like.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.680]   Yes. Yes. Who wished they were single? Yeah, right. And that happens too.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:48.160]   I gotta tell you, more often than not. Yeah. Who I feel sorry for are the parents,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.520]   where the school district should do an online education, and they're trying to work from home
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.640]   at the same time. That is, and I know several of the... And a lot of these parents are just
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.840]   throwing up their hands and saying, "I can't do it. I can't do it." We have good friends. Good
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:12.480]   friends with three school-age kids from like first grade through fifth grade. And there's five of them.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:20.320]   They're all working from home. There's just not enough zoom. There's not enough zoom to go around.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:25.680]   Actually, zoom was down this morning for about three hours in many parts of the country, the
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:32.000]   northeast, California, Texas. And it was 9 a.m. Eastern time, right when church services hit.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.520]   And I think there were a lot of churches who were very unhappy that zoom was down for three hours.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:43.040]   We still don't know why that was. Zoom says they're all back up and running.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:49.280]   I bet there are also a few people saying, "Oh, thank God." No zoom. Yeah. Oh my God. Just a little bit.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:57.680]   Just give me an hour, no zoom. Are you staying... Did you keep somewhere to live, Mike? Or are you
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:06.240]   just camping on your son's couch? Something like that. He has a bedroom. It's mostly where we stay
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:12.960]   when we are in California. So it works out great. We're all foodies. We're doing a lot of cooking
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.040]   and stuff. We're having a lot of fun. It's pretty great. We're in Campbell in Silicon Valley.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.080]   Nice area. Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. It's really great. I have a prepared statement about
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:29.200]   zoom, if you don't mind. Quick advice and a prediction. So the zoom fatigue is real.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.360]   Everybody's written about it. It's awful. There are a whole bunch of reasons for it.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.800]   There are psychological reasons having to do with latency and people staring at you.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.760]   And there's all kinds of problems with video conferencing that involves lots and lots of people.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:48.400]   And so I'm advising companies in my columns to get away from as much as possible. And those of
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.320]   us who have been working from home working remotely since 2004, we didn't have all these
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.240]   video conferencing when we were remote and everybody else was in the office. It's just now that the
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.640]   managers and the leaders are working from home. Now we have to have video conferencing.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.080]   Oh, God. Yeah. It's going to be touchy-feely types. So my advice is try to not have the
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.840]   meeting. Do it an email if you can. If you can't do it an email, do a conference call with audio.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:17.520]   And if that doesn't work, try to keep zoom calls to four people or less. Oh,
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.560]   beyond that, people go crazy. But I'm going to make a prediction, which is I think the future
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.440]   of video conferencing, the thing that will replace it will be avatar-based video conferencing where
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   people's Memoji. I think that Apple will probably announce Memoji on the MacBook
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:38.080]   platform or the iMac platform. And people will have their emoji doing their face expressions,
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:42.400]   moving their mouth, doing all the things that they would do. But that's going to make you worse.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.880]   That will make you a lot of problems. That's too freaky.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:52.800]   So we do. I don't want to have a conference call with a bunch of Lego characters.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.280]   You just you just you just you have a Minecraft server.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.600]   So that's true. I would actually I would do it. I would do it.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.840]   Second life. Yeah. Well, that's what it sounds like. It's just.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.440]   I have a friend of mine, the game industry. They've started holding their team meetings in Red Dead
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.600]   Redemption. Oh, that's a good idea. Go on the campfire and that voice.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.640]   That's a great idea. That way. Yes. Can you do this? So there's like a lobby you could go into
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.880]   and then everybody's in the hanging in the lobby? Exactly. Something like it's a little more
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.960]   more. We should do that. Can you if somebody says something you don't like, can you draw your
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:32.160]   six gun and shoot them? There we go. Yeah. Or if they say something you do like, you can share
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:40.640]   your moonshine. Yeah. That's good. It's good stuff. So we have we have weekly staff meetings for
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:47.120]   the entire editorial staff of the Chronicles about 200 of us. Oh, showed up the last time.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:53.520]   But most of them are on I'd say probably about 40% of them are on phone, the restaurant video,
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.680]   and there are some who do video but don't show their faces. And and actually we all love it because
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:05.360]   we get to see each other. It's only it only lasts about 40 minutes. The editor does much of the
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.200]   talking and there are questions via chat. And it's really good to see everybody's face.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:17.040]   I have to say, it does feel passive aggressive not to show your video in a super call.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.800]   Well, you don't know where they are. Your name is there in big letters. It's like, oh, man,
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:28.640]   that's really great. And so, you know, we there's there's not much anxiety around it with us.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.760]   Everybody kind of likes to see, you know, cats will jump in people's laps and everybody enjoys
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:40.400]   that. And it's kind of more human, humanized our staff. And and I would not want to see a bunch
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:46.480]   of avatars. Well, let me be killed. Yeah, let me be cleared Dwight. I'm not saying this is good.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.560]   I'm predicting it will happen. Yeah. And I'm predicting Apple will launch it. Facebook just
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:56.800]   announced their movie like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so and so I think this is really going to take
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.840]   off. I think over the year from now, avatar based video conferencing is going to be enormous.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.720]   That's just a prediction. I mean, when Facebook came out with spaces, you know, their virtual reality
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.040]   hangout, we played with that a little bit. But that's also a little.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:17.600]   I think it's not that we hate zoom. I agree with you, Dwight. There's certain it's just
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:24.080]   it's fatiguing. It's too much. It's fatiguing after. Well, I had we had last week, I did my 43rd
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.480]   college reunion. One of one of my old roommates got, you know, kind of put it together. There was
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.920]   only about a dozen of us. It wasn't everybody. But it was it was old friends hadn't seen each other
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:40.000]   in some cases in 43 years. In some cases, just a decade or two. It was wonderful. And seeing their
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.880]   faces was great. Although I have to apologize. Because one guy go, I don't know who this is. Who's
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:49.760]   this guy? The whole time. And then I finally figured out who it is. And I went, Oh my God.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:57.200]   That's you. So I apologize. It was you change a little bit.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.800]   You know, people are having a lot of fun with zoom and and they're getting a lot of enjoyment
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:08.000]   out of it in certain circumstances. But I'm talking to a lot of people. We're having two or three or
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.920]   four zooming today with 30 40 or 50 different scenario. Yes. But that's the norm. Dwight,
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.120]   I think that's becoming the norm. Lisa poor Lisa spends almost all day on zoom.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.560]   Because she's working out of the house. I have to get out. I have to come over here. Because it's
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.760]   and the one day that I did three zoom calls, it was like, you know, and I'm on a camera all day.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.960]   It's not that. I don't know what it is. There's something different about it. I don't know.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:41.520]   Do you think that Microsoft build is this week and one of the more interesting products I saw
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:47.520]   them debut was a HoloLens 2. And they did this really interesting feature with it where they would
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:54.320]   use texture maps of your face and they would put it over a 3D skeletal mesh to make like a 3D
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:00.160]   representation of you. It wasn't perfect. It was good. And then you could walk around it in the
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:06.000]   round. You know, as we're seeing here talking today, Magic Leap has basically imploded like the
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.160]   desk. It's terrible. I see so many people laid off because they hired a bunch of game industry
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.680]   people. But I mean, do you think that in the meeting space, like something like AR, there might be
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:24.800]   applications? Because I mean, in engineering, so much of there's some people that can work like
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.600]   closing the door and working by themselves all day. I'm not like that. I have to talk to my team.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:35.760]   I've got to diagram stuff out. Do you think that there could be limited applications for AR where
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:41.360]   you could be with the team more virtually in a way that felt more real? Because I think we all
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:47.200]   agree Oculus is not the answer for that. It's just to remove from everything. It feels arcadey. But
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   I could see an opening for HoloLens here. There's a huge area. There is there. The news
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:45:01.600]   zoom with skeletal mesh renderings. This is all the Apple glasses, which I'm sure we'll come.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:06.000]   Okay, let's take a break. Yeah. I do. I that you brought up some really good stuff. I want to talk
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.800]   about Magic Leap. I want to talk about the Apple glasses there. And I think this is a really
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:16.720]   interesting conversation is now that we're all doing these meetings, where do we go to make them
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:23.040]   less fatiguing, more productive? Is there is there some solution in technology? So this is a great
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:28.400]   subject. I love it. I don't want to cut you off. But let's take a pause so we can thank a sponsor
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:33.120]   and we'll be right back. What a great panel. I love it when we get these conversations and
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.040]   they start flowing like this. And I hate to interrupt it. But I do want to talk about Wasabi.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:43.920]   Our good friends at Wasabi. I heard that. I like them. They're in Boston. They're in your
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:51.280]   neighborhood. It's David friend who I've known for years. Another yaylee. He was very famous. He
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.400]   created the ARP synthesizer. He's got his serial entrepreneur. He created carbonite.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:04.880]   He has created something that I think is the next step, the next generation in hot cloud storage.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.480]   It's incredible. It's called Wasabi, optically named for hot cloud storage. It's the perfect
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.080]   solution. If, for instance, if you're a managed service provider, you're going to love it
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:18.880]   because you can make more money and still charge your clients less. That's because Wasabi
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:27.360]   is 80% cheaper than Amazon S3. Significantly, it's so affordable. It's actually cheaper than on
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.400]   prem storage. In fact, typically you could store that data in Wasabi's cloud for less than just the
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:38.880]   annual maintenance fees on the same amount of on prem storage. That's how affordable it is.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.280]   David was telling me about a Boston high rise in an office building where they put in security
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:51.840]   cameras all over. These cameras are pumping out a lot of data all day, every day. They're
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.040]   buying hard drives. They're buying more hard drives every week. It seems like they're going
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:59.680]   out and buying more hard drives. They're going crazy. He said they moved to Wasabi. It costs
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.880]   them less. It's more accessible. It's better. It's faster. It's easier. I have to say,
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:10.320]   I think Wasabi is more secure than on prem storage. I think it really is. First of all,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:21.040]   they've got an incredible 11 nines of durability. On average, one file every 649,000 years.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.840]   They are hosted in highly secure, fully redundant tier four data centers. They do regular integrity
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:33.840]   checking where every object is checked for integrity every 90 days. That means one bit is lost. They've
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:40.960]   got a copy on the other data center. They move it over. You never lose any data. It's also secure
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.000]   by default. All data in the cloud is, Wasabi cloud is encrypted at rest. Even if you don't
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.320]   specify it, it's automatic. Of course, they follow industry best security models and design
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:58.480]   practices. They've got access control mechanisms like bucket policies and ACLs. My favorite thing,
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:05.280]   though, I love this. You can designate some or all of your data immutable. It cannot be erased.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:11.440]   It cannot be altered. It cannot be encrypted by ransomware. It is protected from hackers,
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:17.680]   from malware, protection from yourself. It is completely safe. This is definitely better
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:23.920]   than on-prem storage. Because Wasabi has this patented way of writing the data to hard drives,
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:32.160]   they are faster than S3. They are less expensive than S3. They don't have all the complex storage
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.640]   tiers that S3 has. There's no fee at all for egress. That'll bite you a lot with S3 where you
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:44.560]   say, "Oh, this is cheap." Then you start to get your data. It's what API requests they use the same
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.120]   API as Amazon S3. You already know how to use it. You have software that can use it, but they don't
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:55.200]   charge for API requests. This is a completely disruptive price performance model. Now there's
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:01.040]   a new way. You can pay as you go. It's very affordable, $5.99 per terabyte per month. That's it. Flat fee.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:06.800]   But you can even save more with reserved capacity storage. If you're that high-rise and you know,
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:14.160]   we're going to be eating up two petabytes every year, you can do reserved capacity storage. You
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:20.960]   buy the cloud storage ahead of time. You can do one, three, or five-year increments. Of course,
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:27.040]   the bigger the amount, the longer the tier, the better the discount. You can really bring that
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.760]   price way down. There's a lot of situations where you know we're going to need this storage.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:38.480]   We are generating this much data. Reserve capacity storage is a very good reason to take a look at
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.640]   what's sobbing. It's good to be number two. You've got to try harder. You've got to work harder.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:49.120]   And that's what was sobbing is. Hypocomplyant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant, highly secure,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:55.040]   disruptive technology. It's turning the industry units here. 80% cheaper, up to six times the speed
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.200]   of the industry leader. You can calculate the savings for yourself and start a free trial right

[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:48.240]   people like you, Brianna, who are using Wasabi for themselves, for backup, for cloud. It's so
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.840]   affordable that a lot of people are just using it, not businesses, but it's really intended for
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.280]   businesses. But I just thought I mentioned that. All right, let's talk because I think this will
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:07.920]   tie into that future of conferencing. There's a little battle going on between two Apple rumor
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:16.560]   mongers, Ming Chico who is in Asia. So he's the supply chain guy. I would say Ming Chico is
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:25.200]   maybe 75% accurate. He's missed on a few things. He said Apple will not be shipping
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:34.160]   augmented reality glasses until 2022. But there's this new guy, the new sheriff in town,
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:42.560]   guy named John Prosser, who of late has been remarkably on. He's he got the iPhone SE down
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:48.880]   perfectly. Quo said Apple's glasses will launch 2022 at the earliest. Prosser says,
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:54.240]   I can't believe I'm going against Quo on this one. But I believe he's wrong. Apple glasses are
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:52:03.760]   aimed for March, June 2021. Also, I've seen them. Their sleek as hell will be showing you soon.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:10.240]   Prosser does not we should be very clear does not work for Apple. He's a tech analyst. He got a
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:15.280]   YouTube channel for a while, but he's got good sources. He's been very, very accurate in the last
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   six months. Now, you've been talking I'm going to slip Mike start with this because you've been
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:28.400]   talking about this whole idea for a long time. You were a glass hole. Yes. In my heart, I still am.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:36.480]   You wore that glass. So long time. I do think that and that's a that's a heads up display,
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:42.400]   which is different from augmented reality, which which which interacts with the physical environment
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:47.360]   in ways that a heads up display like Google Glass does not. But I do believe in the Apple glasses.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:52.480]   I do believe in the future of augmented reality is I actually think it's probably the thing that
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:57.520]   will replace the iPhone in terms of the central device in our lives. But I do believe that Apple
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:04.000]   is working on combining multiple devices, including glasses together into singular experiences. One
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.840]   of them is what we're talking about, which is holographic meetings where an Apple has patents
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.920]   for this sort of thing that they described as very scenario where you consider to conference
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:19.760]   table or not. And basically you have people from the waist up their avatars sitting around,
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.520]   you can look at them. They can look at you. That's what I always wanted to do with Twitch.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:29.360]   That's why you're in a little TV screen, but it'll be I was wanted to have a 3D rendering of Mike
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.440]   Elgin sitting right there and we wouldn't have to ever nobody have to come. Right. And it wouldn't
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:40.000]   age. That's the best part about avatar. But if you if you if you look at like go like Elgin,
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:48.240]   that would be great. Plug me in. Yeah, that's right. But there's a there's a company called
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:52.960]   Spatial that is describing this there in the news this week as well. And they're working on
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:59.120]   this holographic meeting idea for enterprises. But Apple's vision would be you have a MacBook
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:06.400]   Pro in front of you. And it's essentially doing the mapping that that their face ID does on the
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:11.840]   iPhone, mapping you in real time. Everybody else has got a MacBook Pro in front of them. They're
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:18.000]   wearing the Apple glasses. And so what you essentially see is looking over your MacBook Pro,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.880]   you see one person there, one person there, another person there, another person there. And you can
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:27.920]   turn and talk to them. They look at you, you make eye contact with their avatar. And this is the
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:35.920]   future of virtual meetings. This is a brilliant and infinitely doable concept, especially if you
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:41.040]   avatar eyes that don't try to have, you know, essentially what looks like video. That that will
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:48.480]   come eventually back to this pissing contest between these two analysts. I think I think 2022
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:54.560]   is is more realistic. It's one thing to predict the arrival of a of a version of an existing product.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:55:01.600]   It's another thing to predict the arrival of an entirely new platform from a company like Apple.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:06.480]   Apple's never early on these things. They sort of tend to hold back and wait until it's already
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:12.800]   happening. And then they come in and just take over with a beautiful implementation. So next year
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:19.120]   for for Apple glasses to me feels really far fetched, given what's happening or what isn't
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.440]   happening in the world of AR. There's no history of Apple doing developer editions.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.040]   Like so the Google Glass was a developer edition. They didn't intend. Yes.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.360]   And magically did the same thing. But Apple does not have a history of that. Typically they
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:37.200]   keep it quiet. They, you know, quietly see this to a few select developers and then announce it as
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.160]   a consumer product. But they're not going to be able to do that.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:46.320]   I know you did, though, Leo, because if you look at if you look at the history of Apple in 3D.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:53.520]   So when I first started working with Apple technology in 2011, Apple's 3D APIs were
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:59.760]   absolutely not existent. They had the right kit for games, which is why so many games in the
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:06.400]   iPhone when it first came out were 2D. But if you if you look at the state of things,
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:13.600]   they've really been making big investments into AR and 3D technology. I believe it was it was two
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:21.440]   years ago that they finally went and they supported eGPU on any Macbook or iMac or
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:28.400]   series Mac device. So you could hook up a VR or AR goggle set to it and start learning to work
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:36.720]   with Apple technologies with with with these kinds of devices. It wasn't specifically an Apple product
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:43.920]   on the back end. But if you kind of read the smoke and look at the frameworks that have been announced
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:49.760]   year after year after year at the state of the union, they're very clearly moving in this direction.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:56.160]   And it's it's really gotten very good. If you if you think about what a small sleek Apple device
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:02.560]   is going to need, it's going to be less like an Oculus with sensors placed all around the room.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:09.440]   It's going to be closer to the Facebook Oculus, the the goggle set that you did right the quest.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:16.640]   So the quest is great because you're not tied up. But it has the disadvantage of VR, which is so
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:20.800]   what if the Apple goggles this these are safety glasses. This is actually what I wear as part of my
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:27.040]   shopping kit these days. But what if it I mean it I think you would want Apple to do something
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:32.960]   stylish that looked like real spectacles and presumably they they would have prescription lenses in them.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:40.320]   And but the processor said they were sleek the one sleek yeah but I would wear if even if it looked
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:45.520]   like this if it had a little Apple on it I'd wear it. I would so leave one of the things about
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:53.520]   Google Glass. That's not any testimony at all Michael. What is the 2021 day that's aspirational
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:58:01.680]   in other words that that the 2022 day is kind of what they initially were shooting for and what
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:07.280]   they thought they could pull together. But looking at what is happening now and with the
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:12.960]   virtualization of business and the virtualization of socialization. What if they're saying we need
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:19.120]   to get this out the door sooner now. And I will offer this is aspirational. I will offer an
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.760]   evidence an article from the information which is also very well connected back in November.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   They were talking about in all hands meeting at which Apple executives discussed a 2022 release
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:38.720]   for an AR headset and a 2023 release for glasses. But as you point out Dwight that was a long
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:44.880]   November was a lifetime ago. And a lot of things have changed a lot. And so the fatigue you know
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:51.600]   that we've all been talking about the desire for something different in terms of the way
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:57.520]   people gather together online. Maybe driving Apple to say let's see what we could do sooner
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.360]   rather than later. Here's what the information said which would kind of confirm your thoughts
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:08.800]   Brianna Apple's headset code named N301 will offer a hybrid of AR and VR capabilities. It
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:14.560]   resembles the Oculus Quest Facebook virtual reality headset released earlier this year but with a
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:21.360]   sleeker there's that sleek word design. By the way as somebody in the chatroom pointed out when you
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:27.760]   have really good sources at a company like Apple it often is the case that Apple is feeding you
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:35.520]   stuff that it wants to be kind of put out there. So the fact that sleek has appeared now twice
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.280]   it makes me a little suspicious. Cameras will be mounted on the outside of the device.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.120]   Google Glass had a side camera on the temple right. The allowing people to see and interact with
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:52.720]   their physical surroundings. The Oculus Quest has cameras as well. In fact Oculus Facebook came out
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:58.800]   with a way that you don't have to hold a physical device in your hand anymore. It can see your
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.280]   fingers with the cameras and it can tell what you're doing well enough that you don't need a device
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:08.720]   anymore. That's a huge improvement. Apple according to the information wants to make heavy use of
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.800]   fabrics and lightweight materials to ensure the device is comfortable to wear for extended periods
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:21.280]   of time. This was all a presentation at the Steve Jobs Theater in October. Filled the theater a
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.200]   thousand people for internal though intended for people working on this project. The headset
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.480]   will and so this is a I would say a well-sourced leak. The headset will have a high resolution
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:38.000]   display that will allow users to read small type and see other people standing in front of and
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.760]   behind virtual objects. It'll be able to map surfaces. Apple's working on that of course where they
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.880]   are, kitten, its phones, edges and dimensions of rooms with greater accuracy than existing devices
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:55.040]   on the market. Executive said at the meeting they were shown at the meeting a recording of a
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.600]   demonstration which a virtual coffee machine was placed in a real kitchen table surrounded by
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:05.040]   people in a room. The virtual coffee machine obscure people standing behind it. This is the
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:14.640]   ultimate zoom machine. Apple now this may be why the year 2021 comes up. Apple is planning to reach
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.480]   out to third party software developers as early as 2021 to encourage them to build apps. So in
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:26.560]   order to do that Brianna wouldn't they have to have a prototype? Yeah I mean it will be like they
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.000]   did with the iMac Pro and the Mac Pro. Like you get the Apple ships you have a device and it's got
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.120]   wires sticking out of it and you can't access it or look at it but you can develop things on it.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.640]   I imagine it will be something like that. I do have to say though the one thing that gives me
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:50.800]   pause about this product is look at the really big feature on the last iPad Pro that came out.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.240]   You know with the magic keyboard shipping which is a fantastic product it works with either the
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:03.040]   last gen iPad Pro or the one they just unveiled and the one really big feature with that is the AR
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:10.480]   capabilities. If you look in the app store for AR apps and you're like okay what are they shipping
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:19.760]   that would justify me spending you know $1,200, $1,300 on a new iPad. Other than video conferencing it
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:26.880]   really feels like most of the AR applications that they've come up with have been very niche.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:33.440]   It's things like playing lego games on table tops or having a virtual tape measure to measure or
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:42.960]   shopping at Ikea and drawing like a furniture in your room. So I'm interested in this technology
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:48.880]   and I think it certainly has some interesting game applications but I do think it's very worthwhile
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.400]   noting that Oculus has not been able to really figure this out. Apple technology what they are
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.240]   to date and AR kit has not really been able to figure this out. It seems like a technology in
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.760]   search of a problem if that makes sense. Our show today brought to you by ZipperKruder this is a
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.760]   different kind of ad from ZipperKruder. I'm just going to read their message for Batem because I
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.440]   think it's really it's touching. During this time of change we want you to know that ZipperKruder's
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:24.000]   focus has not changed. They're still doing what they've always done helping people find work
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.280]   and helping businesses find the right people for their open roles. If you're looking for a job
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.960]   ZipperKruder is working with you to find the right job faster. They're dedicated to helping
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.440]   you get hired from caretaking to delivering foods and goods to building medical facilities
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.800]   supplying protective equipment and so much more. In fact ZipperKruder's app will send you up to
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:53.280]   date job openings so you can be one of the first to apply. If you're actively hiring ZipperKruder
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:59.040]   will invite candidates to apply to your most urgent roles making it faster and easier to reach the
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:05.200]   people you need. By connecting people who need jobs and companies that need people ZipperKruder is
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:13.120]   working with all of us so we can keep moving forward. Let's work together. That's zipperkruder.com/work
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.800]   together. And boy you know I just personally couldn't be a better time for a company like ZipperKruder.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:24.560]   We're very grateful that they're around and that they're part of our family. ZipperKruder.com/work
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.760]   together some of our best employees came to us from ZipperKruder and I know with two kids who just
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.120]   graduated from college and don't have great job prospects having something like ZipperKruder
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:42.640]   and at both Abbey and Henry are going regularly there to find jobs is a really really huge resource.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:54.080]   So the quest-like device would be 2022 but then as I said the glasses would come out the following year.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:00.160]   They're meant to be worn according to Apple's presentation. They're meant to be worn all day
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.640]   and current prototypes look like high priced sunglasses with thick frames that has the battery
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.800]   and chips. This is the information quoting a person who's seen them. They've also patented
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:17.760]   a use of lenses that darken when people are using AR on them as a way to let you know
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.080]   oh this person's not paying attention he's looking at something and Apple did have that.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:27.120]   That would be creepy. That would be really creepy. You know we've seen in science fiction all the
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:33.120]   time people freeze yeah or they're staring in space as a husband I don't like that at all.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:42.240]   So keep in mind that Apple when it was developing the iPhone and the iPad started out doing the
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.360]   iPad and then they said you know this would be better as a phone and they stopped and they
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:53.200]   switched to the phone and then they came back to the iPad. So again if you're looking for an
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.560]   explanation of the discrepancies you might think about that behavior with the glasses.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:07.040]   People Apple senior managers also told the group they believe later versions of the glasses could
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:13.760]   replace iPhones in roughly a decade and of course that's what Apple really if I were running Apple
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:19.120]   that's what you're looking for. What's the next iPhone? You had such a hit the company was transformed
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.920]   by the iPhone that you've got to be looking for the next thing because it's not going to last forever.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:30.480]   How do you keep up this growth? Do you choose to level off and start declining or do you look for
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:36.240]   another thing that's even bigger than this cash cow the iPhone and I really think that this is
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.400]   a part of that and you can always see where Google's going because they build some of the
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.440]   future technology into current products and I don't think there's been enough attention given to
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:53.520]   to something called the U1 chip which is an ultra wideband chip in the iPhone. They're using it for
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:07:00.560]   almost nothing in the iPhone. It will prioritize what you're going to do the sort of
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:07.200]   sending people airdrop file transfer. It'll prioritize it based on where you point the phone.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:12.720]   That's a really trivial use for this really advanced technology. I really think that chip is going
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:20.640]   into the glasses and it will be able to identify the pretty accurate location of things in your
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.400]   environment. Another thing to point out though is that we always think visually in terms of
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.120]   glasses and of course there will be visual. The whole point of it is to have a visual frame of
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:35.440]   reference where you're capturing information, 3D information with these cameras and you're also
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.960]   seeing things in your field of view. That's the whole point of augmented reality. But the other
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:44.800]   part of it is with glasses that you're wearing all day you have an audio input that is not
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.120]   airbuds or something in your ears. It's something that will probably combine bone
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:56.000]   conduction with little speakers that enable you to be receiving audio information all day long
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.400]   without discomfort. If you look at all the audio based things, moving Apple news to audio,
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:08.000]   doing all these different things, they know that audio is the future. The best platform for
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:15.840]   delivering audio all day long without discomfort is a pair of glasses. The way Apple tends to do
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:21.520]   things is they take super advanced technology and they roll it out in a very basic way that really
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:28.000]   really works right off the bat. So these Apple glasses at minimum are going to work with their
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.400]   tile system to find your keys in the living room. You basically see that something floating in 3D
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:38.960]   space, those are my keys, there's my wallet. They'll have audio input that you can have all day.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:45.920]   Siri will be talking to you in whispering in your ear all day. Also based on contextual
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.320]   information, it'll be able to get information in the environment with these sensors and then
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:56.960]   tell you things with Siri's voice that will help you navigate your day, walking directions, etc.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:04.000]   So the initial concept of the glasses is not going to be some super advanced
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.680]   hollow lens type of thing. It's going to be a very basic, very solid, practical
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:20.000]   collection of features that will basically thrill people. And it'll use advanced technologies to
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.240]   do basic things. And I think that will be a very acceptable market and it's also something they can
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.400]   or could do 2022/2023. I think it's completely doable to do something like that.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:35.280]   If you put together all the pieces of the puzzle, it does look like Apple's working towards something.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.680]   The augmented reality and the iPhone now in the LiDAR and the iPad, the AirBuds or AirPods.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:47.520]   I mean, it feels like they're moving in this direction. You're right, news plus being audio now.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:54.720]   So it does feel like you're putting this together, Face ID. But you brought up the cautionary tale,
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:02.320]   Breanna, of Magic Leap. I think everybody here and everybody listening is excited by the notion of
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:09.040]   this science fiction thing, these augmented reality glasses. And clearly, Apple is trying to make it
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.200]   happen. It doesn't guarantee a success. And Magic Leap is a perfect example. What happened at Magic Leap,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:21.280]   Breanna? I mean, so, you know, just to give listeners or viewers a little bit of background,
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.800]   they had massive, massive venture capital cash. It was one of the biggest in the entire history
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:33.120]   of launching companies. It was vaporware. We never saw product. Eventually, they had this kind of
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:40.240]   alliance with AT&T and brought this product out. In long story short, they did not have experiences
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.280]   that sold the product. So if you went to AT&T and said, "I want to look at Magic Leap," I want to
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:54.400]   see if this is something worth buying or developing for, they didn't have anything that made consumers
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.560]   go, "I want to go out and buy that." And, Leah, this is what concerns me. Because when I look at
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:06.720]   the people, I personally know that we're laid off from Magic Leap this week and last week.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:14.960]   They're not people without talent. They are AAA developers, very smart people in the UI and
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:22.640]   animation. They know how to make good experiences objectively. And this is what gives me pause,
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:30.160]   that if they have all of that money and talent sitting around, Breanna, they don't have the Apple
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:35.760]   name. But if they couldn't make an experience that got Magic Leap to the next level,
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:43.520]   and Apple doesn't currently have anything in the App Store with their AR kit that makes me go,
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:51.600]   "Hey, I'm going to go buy a new iPad to take advantage of that. I'm fundamentally asking myself,
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:57.600]   what are we going to build with this that's going to get the public to go invest $1,000,
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.520]   $2,000 in a pair of glasses? Because that's a big ask.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.560]   Do I?
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:18.160]   Well, your thoughts? So, you know, a lot, I keep going back to the description that Mike had of
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:26.800]   this world where people are avatar-ing everywhere. And it strikes me, it may exist in the uncanny
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.200]   valley, that it's the kind of thing that techies think it would be really cool to do that. But that
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:40.880]   when you get it, try to put this on the face of everyday people, that it has to be so intuitive,
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:51.040]   so simple and so realistic that you don't mind. And that may be what happened with Magic Leap
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:56.080]   is that there was too much computer science in the way of what, getting in the way of what they
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:04.480]   wanted to do. Apple is better at making things human, but you still, you know, with some of the
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:10.480]   things that they do, you could still smell the computer science. And I worry that, you know,
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:17.520]   Mike, people like Mike and I and Brianna, and you want this, but that everyday folks,
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:24.560]   as Brianna said, are not going to want to shell out $1,000 or $2,000 to live like that.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.160]   Yeah. I think if they get, if they can get it to do it,
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:34.800]   it will become the new normal. I think it will take off. It's just going to be difficult. You know,
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.120]   Amy Webb, who's on the show regularly consulted with Magic Leap, she had tried the fancy Magic Leap,
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:47.760]   not the Magic Leap one, the developer thing they put out. She's still a believer. Her thought was,
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.560]   the problem is you can't do a venture capital based company to develop something like this.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:03.040]   It's too long term. It's too blue sky. And well, that's the point. VC wants to turn around too
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.840]   quickly for this to have ever had worked. This really is something that should come out of a
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.560]   university. It should come out of a government, come out of a lab. It is blue sky R and D.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:20.880]   There are very few companies, IBM, you know, remember Bell Labs, that will put that kind of money into
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:26.880]   R and D. Apple's R and D spending historically used to be very, very low. Over the last five years,
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:32.640]   it's gone up and up and up and up. I think Apple's the kind of company that doesn't see this as a
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:40.240]   short term VC like investment. I sure they see some urgency because they've sold everybody in
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:45.680]   the world an iPhone. There's somewhere else to go. So they need the next thing. But I also think
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:52.400]   that they have maybe more patience than the investors in Magic Leap had. So it doesn't, but
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:58.480]   you're right. It doesn't mean that they can do it. It just means that they have perhaps more stamina.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.240]   If anybody could do it. Yeah, if anybody could do it. Yeah, I mean,
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:06.800]   if anybody could do it. It's sort of absolutely that's absolutely true. The difference is though,
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:13.120]   if you're getting more venture capital than any other company, especially if you're based in Florida,
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.800]   and you have to say, okay, we're going to take this new technology that we're developing and
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.040]   we're going to revolutionize science. It's going to be used by astronauts. We're going to recreate
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:29.360]   the world. You have to do that to justify the massive amounts of capital. You have to make a big
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:38.560]   play. Apple has to make a small play. If you look at the role of airbuds in our lives, we all used a
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.240]   Sony Walkman back in the day, except maybe Priana. And back in the day, when you put something over
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:51.280]   your ears, I can see Brianna bopping down the avenue. I don't know. My dad gave me his.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.680]   Okay. So back in the day, you put things over your head because you're going to listen to an
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:02.400]   album. I mean, you were saying, I'm going to listen to music now and you put on something over you.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:08.640]   So now how do people use their airbuds? They're controlling the audio. They're getting notifications,
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:12.480]   they're interacting with Siri, they're playing music, they're doing calls, they're doing all kinds
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:20.160]   of stuff. Essentially, it's a way that enhances the phone, mostly. It takes all the stuff in your phone
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:24.960]   and it makes it much better. And I think that's what these glasses are going to do. It's going to
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.560]   do for the phone what the AirPods did for the phone, which is just give you another
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:37.040]   sense, another physical human sense to interact with your phone and its content better. You'll
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.160]   be able to control things in space. Instead of double tapping on your earbuds, you can swipe
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:48.000]   with an in the air gesture, for example. You'll get notifications when you hear the bleep bleep,
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.160]   you can just see it. Oh, so and so is, you know, I messaging me right now. That's better than
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:01.120]   pulling your phone out of your pocket. All of these things are not life changing revolutions.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.800]   They are little things that feel really good. That's what Apple is going to do with these glasses,
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:14.800]   I think. I hope so. I just want to say one of the reasons I believe VR failed is because
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:22.160]   it's exactly like you're saying, Mike, we were thinking about ideas that didn't take advantage of
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:29.280]   the technology that we were aiming towards. VR, what we ended up doing is funding a bunch of
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:36.400]   startups that were bringing ideas from the game industry instead of starting new ideas that were
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:42.160]   kind of from scratch. So Rubble Recall is a great example. It's a VR game. It's a fantastic game.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:48.320]   It's made an unreal engine. It's a great immersive shooter. But even for someone like me that lives
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:54.400]   and dies by that kind of technology, I can only play it for 20 minutes and I get bored because it's
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:00.880]   taking an idea from the game industry that's really better on a PlayStation sitting in front of a TV.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:08.960]   So I think if this is going to be better, we need to be thinking about like mundane things too.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.600]   Like what about someone working in a warehouse trying to find different things there, working
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:21.120]   in a data center, swapping that out. That's a good application of AR or somebody at a courthouse
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:28.160]   trying to find records. I think we have this idea of a science fiction future and I think when AR
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.800]   starts, it's going to be a lot more mundane. It's going to be like you said, Mike, like reading
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:39.280]   Apple news articles to you. Well, if you think about the Apple Watch started really is just a
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.720]   side card of the phone and it slowly gained some stature. It's not quite a standalone device yet,
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.720]   but that is a gradual evolution that's taken at what five years. And I could see that's the
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:54.480]   thing. I think we all would love to get these glasses tomorrow, but it's not going to happen
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.520]   tomorrow. It's not going to happen in the year. It's not going to happen in five years.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:03.520]   But I think the Apple Watch is a great example of what is likely with the glasses. I mean,
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.440]   we were all kind of disappointed in the Apple Watch for the first year or two years, three years.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:14.080]   And gradually and when nobody was looking became like this fantastic wearable, it's really great
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:20.400]   now. And it was just it just creeped. There was no big aha moment. It just sort of just got better
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.600]   and better and better. That's probably what's going to happen with the glasses. They're going
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:29.280]   to come out. We're all going to crap all over them. They're going to disappoint everyone. And then
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.680]   over the next five years, they're going to become amazing. I should point out of Apple acquired a
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:42.160]   company called NextVR. All that's on the NextVR page now is NextVR is headed in a new direction.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:50.800]   But this was a platform for 3D virtual reality sports, music, and entertainment experiences.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.840]   And so it's an interesting acquisition for Apple.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:20:01.440]   It fits perfectly in with what Apple's doing, except that Apple has no VR or AR.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:09.440]   So why did they buy these guys? All right, let's take a little break. We got more to talk about.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:15.120]   And I've got to figure out what that thing is behind Brianna. I don't know if that's I don't know.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:21.680]   What is my 3D printer? Oh, okay. That's my Lullsbot task work work. That's your task.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:27.520]   You know, next time, could you have it printing something during the show or is it really?
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.240]   I could, absolutely. Yeah. It's not that loud. Yeah, we'd be. Give us something, you know,
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:38.400]   like we could watch it. It's like a cooking show slowly. My husband, he will whip up anything.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:44.800]   He's so good in 3D. There was the TV back there. I wanted Apple TV shelf for it. He just opened up
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.760]   inventor fusion and 3D model be one last night that's printing on our other printer right now.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:57.120]   See, I want that's what I if 3D printers would do that. I would get one. But mostly it seems like
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:04.960]   they're down for adjustment. Oh, yeah. It's really quirky. I want the power of a 3D printer
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:10.480]   without the hassle of a 3D printer. I could think of a lot of things. I want to make face masks. I
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.640]   want to make, you know, not not not not breathing masks. I'm already sewing those. I want one of
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:23.440]   those clear plastic shields. I want to face shield. You could throw something like a like a like a
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   like I have some 3D copper filament for this. There's a special medicinal filament that came out and
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:36.560]   it's bacteria and viruses won't stick to copper. It's what they used to to sterilize it. So they
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.360]   came out with this filament and Frank and I are waiting. He's a microbiologist. He has a PhD in
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:47.600]   microbiology and we're going to print a face mask on that task workhorse. And then we're going to
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:53.520]   run a test with this filament and see. Okay, it says that things can't grow on it. Let's make
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.480]   sure that's true before we start printing these out. It'd be like Bane. It'd be like the hardness.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:07.680]   I could not get COVID not turn. Go ahead and try. I like it. We're going to have more with Brianna
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:13.760]   Wu former candidate for Congress soon to be game developer once again or something or maybe a
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:19.200]   lobbyist. I think she should be a lobbyist. Dwight Silverman. He's a tech burger. I remember when
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:24.560]   Dwight got out of the tech industry business for about 20 minutes. Yeah, he's back, baby.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:31.040]   And Mike Elgin, he's not traveling. That means we get more of him. Our digital nomad
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:38.560]   at gastronomad.net and of course Elgin.com. This week I gave away my Bitcoin wallet.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:46.880]   Previously on Twitter. Hello everybody. Welcome to who wants to be a Bitcoin air. What type of animal
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:54.080]   was seen being dramatic? It looks like it's so small. No, it was like this.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:23:01.840]   How did it do it again? Do it again? Show me a horn time. Oh, that's it.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:08.640]   Twitter vids. Evan A. Barr, this goes back to our conversation about voting. He said we can bank
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:15.680]   online with security. How is voting more difficult than online banking? We need voting to be universal
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:21.840]   and online banking is not right. You're extending the security infrastructure of online banking in
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:30.240]   a universal way. Why can't you do that? Hands on photography. It is part two of our shelter in place
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:36.560]   time last photography and video tutorial. That's all about Android. We talk with Brandon
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:42.400]   Bielinski who's the product manager for YouTube music about the YouTube music Google play music
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:48.160]   integration. You know, YouTube music is a great premium audio service. It's ready for play music
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.280]   users to come over. And you know, we launched the one tap to transfer experience that moves all your
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:01.920]   content over to it. I got your Bitcoin right here. I should mention this one little catch. I'll be
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:08.160]   glad to send you the wallet file. But I forgot the password. See? Great. Just like all of us.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:16.960]   If you can crack it, there is a significant amount of money in there. I'm just saying there's
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:23.200]   more than seven bitcoins in there. But so I won't say who won, but it was a really fun contest. You
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:29.280]   can go where is it on the feeds? It's on YouTube, right? YouTube.com/twit. You can watch our this
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.160]   as part of every Friday. Now we do Twitter after hours. I hope we keep doing this after this is over
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:38.960]   because it's so much fun. We've done the match game. We've done Ask Me Anything. We've done trivia.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:45.200]   We'd love to have you guys on future ones. We're bringing all sorts of people on. And this time
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:53.680]   we did who wants to be a Bitcoin Air. And I gave away my 7 plus Bitcoin wallet. But it's not good
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:58.160]   to anybody because I don't know the password. I can't remember it for the life of me. I've been
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:02.400]   but maybe the winner and I won't say who because I don't want to know spoilers. But the person who
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:08.240]   won it has some significant technical skills. Maybe they can do a brute force or something.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:15.840]   In a few years they might be a Bitcoin Air. I don't know, Leo, why don't you do a for
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:25.760]   the after hours show? Do a serious deep computer history trivia game. Get Harry McCrackett on there.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.720]   Get me on there. That's a great idea. Get some folks who've been around for a long time.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.920]   Get some old timers on. Yeah, serious. Jerry Pornell's ghost.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:41.920]   Yeah, my kubel rental. Get Jerry Pornell. That's a great idea done. We will do that. Old timer.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:50.640]   Tech trivia. Serious. Because we did Tech trivia in this who wants to be a Bitcoin Air.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:56.960]   But it wasn't the hardest tech trivia ever. There were some but yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.760]   Some of the really tough tech trivia. Are you pretty good at that Dwight? You think you know that?
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:09.920]   I think so. Let's put it this way. I used to know a lot of stuff. That's the problem, right?
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.320]   That's right. That is the problem. The older the trivia, the more you've forgotten.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:20.080]   Actually, what you should do is get Harry to do the questions because you know, in terms of like
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.960]   Mr. Computer. Well, he's been doing some really good pieces at Fast Company. What was his?
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:33.040]   Yes. His most recent article. What was it? It was really good. I can't remember but I'll find it.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.000]   But he's he does such a good job and he does a lot of that computer history. Here's one,
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.680]   how the telephone failed its big test during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. We'll get some of
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.360]   those questions there. Yeah, there we go. I remember that.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.560]   I made the mistake of saying something negative about the TRS 80.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:27:04.240]   Well, okay, to be fair, that was a trash 80 around. Oh, he's going to. Oh, no, you're
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:11.040]   your. Harry loves this stuff. That was the computer that if you were house slippers and slid your
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.640]   feet along the carpet before you sat down on it, you could kill it. You could literally
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:21.600]   kill it with a static shock. It was like, that's it. I don't work anymore. So there were a few people.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:27.680]   A few people. Yeah, that's a good idea. Right? We'll do that. We do those every Friday,
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.800]   4 p.m. Civic, 7 p.m. Eastern. Our Twitter after hours, it's turned out to be one of the most
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:39.200]   enjoyable things we do. It's a lot of fun. Let me do one more ad. Then I do want to get to,
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:44.400]   I want to get to Unreal Engine 5. Yes. Because I know you're excited about that.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:49.920]   And I am too. In fact, we'll show some of the video that Tim Sweeney unveiled. He said some
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.920]   interesting things about the PS5, including this new PlayStation 5 is so good. PC makers are going
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:03.440]   to learn a lot about how to make PCs. Very interesting. Our show brought to you by Linked
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:09.600]   in Learning. I love Linked in Learning for a long time. We were using linda.com and I did all.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.240]   And I have so many friends who were teachers, experts. They did great classes.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.480]   Linked in Bottom. They've turned into Linked in Learning. And now it's just grown. It's gotten
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:28.480]   better and better. The platform is so good for education. 16,000 courses taught by the best in
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.800]   the business, the best industry experts. You can learn skills like how to master working from home.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:38.000]   We're all dealing with that. Entrepreneurship foundations. How to be a resilient leader.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.360]   There are some amazing, I mean, 16,000 courses to choose from. I know lots of folks,
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.320]   many of the people you've seen on our shows who are Linked in Learning professors. I don't know,
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:53.440]   educators. There's also stuff, there's soft skills like 10 ways to stay motivated while job hunting.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.840]   I sent that one off to my kids. Things like managing in difficult times. Yeah, that's a class.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.240]   And one of the things I love about Linked in Learning, you get custom tailored course
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:09.120]   recommendations. You get project files. You get quizzes that really interact if you really get
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:14.400]   to practice what you learn. It's really learning. And that's why they call it Linked in Learning.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:19.200]   Courses are available, of course, anytime anywhere on your computer, on your phone. You get a certificate
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:25.200]   when you complete the course, perfect for framing or putting up on your Linked in profile. And by
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.240]   the way, we've been doing this for years. We offer Linked in Learning to our team because we want
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.720]   them to get skills. We want them to learn new things, to grow, to expand. It's the best way to

[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.400]   all the time in all so many games. It's not just Unreal, right, Brianna?
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:32.240]   Right. Well, we have a lot of different engines in the game industry. It's frostbite. There's
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:38.800]   Unity. But Unreal, in particular, is very exciting because it's used beyond the game industry. If you
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:45.600]   saw the Star Wars movie Solo, you saw Unreal Engine used for a lot of the special effects there.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:54.560]   It's just a remarkably agile 3D engine that's really, really good at cinema.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:31:01.760]   So, people use it in television pipelines. It's a Swiss Army knife of 3D work.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:09.200]   And I was asking you, how do you work in Unreal Engine? Is it coding?
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:16.320]   Well, it's a little bit of everything. So, you have the Unreal Editor with Unreal 4,
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   and you can install it on PC or Mac. If you're designing 3D assets, you can bring something in
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:29.600]   for Maya or Macs or Blender and put in an FBX and import it. You can certainly code.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:35.520]   Or if you don't want to learn to code, you can just use visual nodes. They have an entire visual
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:41.120]   scripting language called Blueprint, which is excellent. Many games that are shipped with Unreal
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:46.480]   Engine don't have a line of written code in them. It's just people hooking Blueprint nodes together.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:53.520]   It's a really, really good language. In fact, with the last game I shipped,
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:59.840]   I know C++ really well, but I ended up working in their visual scripting language because it was
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:06.480]   faster. We were trying to ship a very complicated game on iOS devices. So Unreal Engine is awesome.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:10.240]   Before the show we were talking about, I was showing you some Minecraft stuff the kids have done.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:14.880]   We've got a bunch of 17-year-olds who have their own Minecraft worlds, and they're doing a lot of
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.440]   design. You said, "That's the kind of skill." Those kids have the kind of skill that they could then
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:26.560]   go to something like Unreal Engine and design real games. That's really interesting.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.160]   And so there's a whole generation. What they're doing is more complicated because they're having
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:35.920]   to design the static meshes. With Unreal Engine, it's just you go into Content Manager and drag the
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.680]   door, the wall, the box, whatever there, and then do the lighting for it. So they're actually
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:47.920]   doing something as harder. That's interesting. And it's free. Well, it's free to a point.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:53.280]   Unreal Engine 5 that's coming out will be free up to a million dollars at which point you'll have
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.840]   to pay royalties. I'll pay royalties after the first million. I'm okay with that.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:03.120]   Well, my last license for Unreal Engine, if we wanted to put C++ code in it, we had to write
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:08.720]   Epic a check for, I believe it was $30,000. So this is a much better deal for many people.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:12.320]   That's great. And is Epic Games do this for the money?
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:20.800]   Well, you know, where's the Fortnite has become so popular that they've got the money.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.880]   Yeah, Tim Sweeney made $7 billion himself last year. Right.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:31.520]   They're really pushing the Epic Store. So there was a announcement this week that Unreal Engine 5
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:35.440]   is coming out with just a breathtaking demo. And it got a lot of attention.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:39.920]   Let's take a look. We've got some of that video. Tell me what is this is the Epic.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:46.720]   Instead of GDC, they just did a video. So tell me what is new in this. Is it lighting?
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:54.640]   So it is lighting. So if you look at this, look at the number of, we call them tries in the
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:34:00.080]   game industry, basically the number of vertexes on all of this. When they get very close,
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.200]   you're not just going to see the lighting. You're going to be able to really, really make out
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:10.960]   every single point on the statue. So all of this stuff is really a combination of polygons,
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.600]   often triangles, that's why it called tries. So look at that rock right there.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.400]   Looks like traditionally, triangle. That's amazing.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.920]   Well, traditionally in a game, if you looked at something like a rock,
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:28.240]   we've come up with ways to fake it with normal mapping, which basically puts a 2D image over a
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:34.640]   3D object. It takes depth. Yeah. Well, it fakes depth and makes the engine render it in a way that
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:41.520]   looks deeper. What they found out how to do here is to render so many tries with this statue,
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:48.080]   that it just looks unbelievably realistic. And the thing that is exciting for game developers,
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:54.800]   like me, is rather than having to go through and optimize every single statue to have a low
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:00.560]   poly, medium poly, a high poly, and ultra high poly, this new engine is going to do it all
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:07.440]   dynamically, which has a lot of applications, not just for PlayStation games, but for VFX,
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:13.280]   for television logos, for everything. So it's really exciting. I feel like I'm at Petra Jordan.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:18.800]   I mean, you could recreate real world stuff. This is truly mind-boggling.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.160]   Look at that dynamic lighting. That is so computationally intense.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.120]   So what they're doing is moving the light source and then it figures out what it looks like on
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:33.120]   each try as it's going through the scene. That's exactly right. If you look at a video game,
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.920]   you'll notice that shadows and lighting will affect your character, a skeletal mesh,
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:44.400]   but it's not going to affect the environment around you beyond shadows. So this is a way of
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:51.680]   doing it. It's dynamic lighting. It's much deeper. Ray tracing is, if I recall correctly,
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:57.040]   it's not in this demo yet, but we hope to have that. Because you're starting to get
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:03.680]   ray tracing now in some hardware. Look at this. This part is what is absolutely stunning.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:10.640]   And even the person looks pretty darn real. There's always that uncanny valley with the
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:17.040]   characters in these games. For some reason, they can make rocks. I feel like we're in Petra.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:22.720]   Wow. That's amazing. The number of tries it's computing is just mind-boggling.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.600]   What kind of hardware, though? This must be running on a supercomputer, right?
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:32.880]   Right. That was my question. If I remember correctly, this is targeted for the PlayStation 5.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:39.360]   So I don't think the video, and you'll look this up, but as I recall, this is something that could
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:46.080]   run dynamically on a normal PlayStation 5, but it was pre-cooked ahead of time. So it's footage
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:51.440]   in development from an engine that's in development. Wow. I've got to buy a PlayStation 5.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.960]   Will the Xbox Series X, their competitor, both coming out at the end of the year, will that have
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:02.880]   similar capabilities or? Well, I imagine Unreal will eventually run on it. The thing I love about
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:09.040]   Unreal is you can create a game once, and then you can port it to Android. You can port it to Mac.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:15.440]   You can port it to PC. You can port it to even switch in some cases. So it's a very versatile
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:21.360]   Swiss Army knife. This is really incredible. I look at the birds and
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.800]   addictive foot placement. The lighting is amazing. The lighting is amazing.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:31.280]   The lighting is amazing. The way the scarf is flowing. That's older technology, but that's
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:38.400]   physics on that particular scarf and the way the bone structure inside of it is floating around.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:46.000]   So, I mean, if you think about the calculations involved are phenomenal.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.760]   Well, they figured out how to optimize it. But something like this just could not be done on a
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.080]   PlayStation 4. It would be impossible. If you read the Carmack's book about the early days of
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:06.560]   it, the techniques that he had to use to make doom even vaguely playable, there was a lot of
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:13.360]   trickery involved. And that was partly because the processors weren't that good, but I think that
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.280]   there is still algorithmically a lot of magic going on here.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:23.120]   Yeah. What's exciting about this for developers is if I was trying to do something like this in
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:29.760]   Unreal Engine 4, I would have to spend a week on every one of these statues. I would have to go
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.560]   into ZBrush with that particular shield and create custom normals and spectral maps.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:40.640]   What they focused on is the pipeline here for developers. So I would be able to take that
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:50.000]   high poly asset directly from ZBrush, bring it into Unreal Engine, and then like your kid making
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.600]   a Minecraft level, just drag and drop that into the scene. And then it would do that. This is what
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:01.360]   they're saying that it will do all that work for me beneath the hood. Is it just ZBrush?
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.560]   Will it work with Blender or other 3D? Yeah, it would work with other 3D programs, but something
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:16.400]   this detailed is done in ZBrush. So yeah, if what they're saying is true, this is going to really
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.520]   cut down on the amount of time it takes games to create things that are visually stunning.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.640]   Right. And you can see why Epic is doing this because these games will probably be on the Epic.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:33.040]   A lot of them will be on the Epic platform. They sell on an Epic Store. They just want a
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.800]   Fortnite every year is all we ask. Which is fine because Fortnite is very low poly.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.400]   Oh, no, it's not interesting, isn't it? It's not challenging. Was that a aesthetic decision or
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:48.960]   is that a decision based on the fact you're going to have a lot of players, a lot of things to calculate?
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:54.720]   I mean, you try and make games like that for a wide, wide, wide audience. Like
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:00.240]   you have more crafts like that as well. Yeah. Wow, this is just stunning stuff.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.720]   That's one advantage of having a platform like the PlayStation 5. It's so dominant
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:09.760]   that you can say, well, I know there's going to be a million players out of the box ready to
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.880]   wipe my game. Yeah. I'll tell you what, after looking at this, I can't wait to get one.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.800]   That's well, they will it look like this out of the? I mean, it's not even out yet, right?
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.320]   Well, well, the one thing is, you know, if you talk to Amazon about, you know, their
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:30.240]   lumberyard technology, they will swear up and down that it's great. It's amazing. I mean,
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.400]   the company is going to tell you their product is great. Everybody can do this.
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:39.600]   Right. I want to see developers look at this and evaluate the pipeline. I certainly will when I
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:45.200]   can get my hands on it. But, you know, Epic, I can say this, I've worked with them a lot.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.400]   They've always been a very honest company with me. Their support has always been excellent,
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:55.440]   and they're a very developer focused company. So I've from my experience, I have no reason not
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:01.200]   to believe what they're saying is true. Just to be clear, is this pre-rendered or, in other words,
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.920]   is it like a cutscene? They kept saying interactive. It looks like it's being played.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:09.440]   Right. It would be something like that would be done on the fly in the game.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:14.480]   In real time. Even cutscenes are not pre-baked. I mean, nowadays they are being rendered in the
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:20.960]   engine. It's just playing straight through. Really? Yeah. Wow. Generally. Yeah. They don't render
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:25.200]   them ahead of time to make them look better. They do some of them. But generally speaking,
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.480]   most cutscenes and games are using the engine dynamically, which is why. Yeah. Is this the best
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:36.720]   engine out there now? I think we'll have to look at it and tell. But I've spent my career learning
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:49.280]   Unreal Engine. Wow. It's just in the nick of time. When we get the second wave of quarantine in
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:56.640]   place for the year 2021, we'll have a great game machine to play with it. Was that Tomb Raider
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:03.760]   or is it just a random new IP that they were playing with? Wow. Really interesting.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.400]   Dwight, you don't play video games, do you? You're a big Fortnite player.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.600]   No, I did a long time ago. I was kind of a big Doom quake. Yeah, me too.
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:22.800]   But I just ran. I don't have the time to do that anymore. And now I would get my butt handed to me.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:29.920]   My handle was the llama king, which tells you how bad I was. You really kicked the llamas, but did you?
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:38.880]   Yes. The other way around. So I played a lot of Unreal when it first came out.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.240]   Oh, yeah. That was 20 years ago, wasn't it? Yeah.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.280]   And that looked amazing for its time. It was mind-boggling.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:54.080]   So NASA uses Unreal to develop training for astronauts. I did a story about
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:58.880]   virtual reality at NASA several years ago. And one of the things they have a lab where they
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:02.560]   essentially train astronauts what to do if they get in trouble on a space walk.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:09.440]   And I got to use their simulator with VR where I was essentially standing out on the edge of the
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:15.680]   arm on the space station, the robotic arm. Oh, that's cool. And it was incredible. And they
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:21.760]   use Unreal. Some of them, some of the other simulations use Unity, but it was incredibly impressive.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:28.240]   Yeah. The thing I like about Unreal is the cinematic scripting part of it. Like, if you're
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:35.920]   looking to do cinematic scripting, they've just, they really invented the interactive cut scene
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:42.480]   in 3D and games in a way that was very accessible for developers. So they've literally been working
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.960]   on that part of the engine since 1998. And they've gotten to be very good at it.
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:53.760]   Yeah. Yeah. '98. I remember on the screensavers that we built what we called at the time,
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:44:00.640]   the ultimate gaming machine, which had a CRT monitor that was like 800 pounds. And it was,
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.600]   it was a wide screen monitor, which in those days was probably this. But we played a lot of
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.880]   Unreal. And it blew my mind then because I played Doom, which was, you know, go back and look at
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.920]   the original Doom. Pretty gritty. And then Quake, we loved Quake. And then Unreal came out. It was
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:22.880]   like this. How are they doing this? It's amazing. Let's take a little break. Mike, do you want to
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:32.400]   talk about gaming? I left you out. No. Okay. I'm a workaholic Leo. I don't play games at all.
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.760]   I know. But in fact, I love games. I've been a gamer my whole life, but I don't have the time
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:44.000]   or the patience anymore. And it's a problem. It takes a real, a lot of devotion, especially now
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.640]   with these young kids, you go and you start call a duty and you're dead. You know, I played Fortnite.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:54.720]   I loved it, but I died. I was like, there's 100 people go in. Leo goes out. It's like it was over
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:02.400]   before it even began. So. Can I say that that's not your fault? That's the game industry's fault.
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:09.680]   In the last 10 years, we've shifted towards a game design that is, it is designed to bring you in
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.960]   for massive amounts of time to give you a huge learning curve and to keep you hooked as long as
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:21.200]   possible. I love games that you can go beat in five to 10 hours and we just don't ship those anymore.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:27.840]   So that's not your fault, Leo. The last game I loved and finished, I think, was Bioshock
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:34.000]   infinite. Yeah. Yeah. And you could finish that in a reasonable amount of time. And I also
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.280]   loved but did not finish Skyrim because those are such vivid worlds and they were unique and
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:43.440]   interesting worlds. They were more it was more than just how many people can you how many kills
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:48.000]   can you rack up in five minutes. There was really a story and there was and there was you'd go
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.240]   around a corner and something interesting was happening. And I would love to see more games like
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:58.800]   that. I remember thinking when Bioshock infinite came out. Well, that's that. That's that's unreal
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:05.520]   engine, by the way, is it? Yeah. Amazing, isn't it? But I look at Unreal Engine. I think we're going
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:10.240]   to see a lot of things besides games coming out of this. So, so, you know, as you said, NASA and
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:16.240]   you know, I could see travel. I could see all sorts of interesting uses Hollywood Hollywood. Yeah.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:22.640]   Yeah. Military uses it for training for safety training. So interesting. Yeah. Deep fake videos.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:27.760]   Political propaganda. Just think. Yeah. Just think what you could do with it.
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:32.960]   I showed today brought to you by ExtraHop. Just think what you could do with ExtraHop with
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.520]   more and more companies going remote. The cyber criminals are out there. They're ready to take
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:43.440]   advantage of the changing IT reality. More important than ever for organizations to know what's going on
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:48.720]   in their enterprise. And I don't just mean your local area network or even your wide area
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:55.520]   network. I mean your cloud. I mean, IoT devices, employees are at home. Remember when somebody
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:01.680]   brought a Raspberry Pi into NASA and it brought the whole thing down? Now, it's the opposite.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:07.280]   You're bringing NASA to your Raspberry Pi. You're in people's houses. That's why you need ExtraHop.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.720]   In order to protect and scale your business because that's how ExtraHop started with performance
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.280]   monitoring. You need more than just visibility. You need fast reliable information about threats,
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:22.080]   about remote access problems. And when you get that information, you need it in the context
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:29.200]   that helps you act and fix the problem right away. That's ExtraHop. It helps you to detect threats
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:36.560]   and performance issues up to 95% faster and respond 60% more efficiently. You're going to get complete
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:42.000]   visibility on every asset in your enterprise. And that's in real time. In fact, go to the ExtraHop
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.160]   site, extrahop.com/twit and take a look at the dashboard. They have a demo dashboard. You will
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:54.480]   be blown away. You'll say, "How do I get this? I want this now. I want to see every asset in real
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.680]   time at scale now. You can secure your hybrid enterprise wherever it is today, wherever it goes
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:06.400]   tomorrow automatically detect new rogue and unmanaged IoT devices, see everything in your environment
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:11.680]   from the cloud to the data center all the way down to the customer. ExtraHop is awesome. It keeps
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:17.760]   your business safe and available at any scale." Look at that. Wizards of the coast, they use ExtraHop.
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:25.120]   They use to support and secure their AWS cloud. Wizards of the coast chief architect Dan McDaniel
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:31.040]   said, "There's no other company that aligns to supporting our DevOps model, the speed, the lack
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:37.680]   of friction than ExtraHop. He loves it. The Home Depot uses it. The Home Depot's got
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:44.080]   2,300 remote sites. They've got point of sale. They've got a massive security challenge.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:49.680]   They use ExtraHop to manage and secure those remote sites. And this is the quote, "No data set is
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.840]   more complete and accurate than what ExtraHop delivers." If you need that information, if you need
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:03.760]   to threat detection, if you have performance issues, if you are anxious to respond quickly to anything
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:08.880]   happening to your network, you can take control of your cloud and your cloud security right now
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:14.720]   with ExtraHop. Get tips on securing and supporting remote access. And then honestly, you got it.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:21.520]   It is so cool. Check out the full product demo at extrahop.com/twit. But I got to warn you,
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:29.600]   as soon as you see, you're going to say, "Why don't we have this?" ExtraHop.com/twit. These guys are
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:39.440]   great, great product. In a way, this show has really been all about how cool technology is
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:47.760]   and how cool it's getting. And I think so many times we get jaded and complacent, "Oh, it's all a mess."
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:53.280]   There is amazing stuff going on out there. And the kind of visualizations you can get with ExtraHop,
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:59.920]   that's a perfect example. I almost want to just, let's talk about good stuff. Let's make this the
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:06.240]   positive episode of Twit. We've had enough negative episodes of Twit. I want to talk about the
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:12.560]   good things, like the University of California College graduation that in Minecraft that they
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:20.720]   built. That's awesome. I think a lot of companies are saying, "Twitter just in that's they're going to
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:28.480]   let employees work at home forever." Employees love it. It sounds like they're expanding the hours
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:36.400]   that they expect to work. Oh, you cynical person. Never stop working. You know, it's kind of funny
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:43.600]   because I think I've been advocating remote work for for for for decades. 20 years. That's what you
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:49.600]   do. Yeah. Yes, exactly. And and and there's always been this resistance, "Oh, can't be done,
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.320]   can't be done." And now everybody's doing it. And people are saying, "Hey, you know, that really
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:59.760]   could have been an email. This is like totally working." That's that's one of the reasons why I've
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:05.280]   been so anti-zoom because zoom is kind of taking away some of the benefits of remote work, which is
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:10.320]   that you can focus. You can control your environment to a certain extent. But once people are actually
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:15.120]   working remotely without their kids being at home and schools canceled and without all these zoom
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:19.360]   meetings all day, it's going to really enhance productivity. The other thing that I think is really
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.960]   interesting for for the show is that a lot of people in Silicon Valley are saying, "Why are we
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:30.800]   here paying these prices?" Right. Dealing with this traffic. They don't have to. If we're
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:35.760]   going to be from home, our home could be anywhere. And so why don't we go live in a cabin? Why don't
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:41.040]   we go live abroad? Why don't we live in a small town? And this is really, I think, going to change
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:49.040]   the dynamics of cities. Probably not great for the cities, but probably great for the lifestyle that
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:54.400]   people, especially people lucky enough to work in tech and other kinds of industries where
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:52:00.160]   you can work remotely work. And I think it's going to be a massive transformation. It's really an
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:06.160]   accelerant of a trend that was already inevitable. I think we've just leapt forward 10 years in
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:12.480]   terms of how many people are going to be working from home. I have a different opinion on this.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:18.640]   After Game of Game of Game, I worked with Twitter quite a bit to update their policies and to
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:24.400]   figure out what happened and to stop things like that from happening again. And when I've gone to
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:33.120]   Twitter, and I've seen in person the kinds of alliances and friendships that people have as
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:39.760]   they've tried to navigate this giant corporation with a lot of different competing departments
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:47.120]   with different goals, I've seen firsthand the value of being able to bring someone down to the
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:54.480]   cafeteria to hang out and to talk to someone about a point of view that they hadn't considered.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:02.720]   And I think even if you widen that out from just Twitter, I do think that in person has value.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:09.600]   Does that mean that every single company moving forward needs to spend a huge amount of money
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:16.640]   paying for San Francisco real estate? No, of course not. But I do think that there's
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:22.080]   something that gets lost when you move to 100% virtual, especially in engineering teams.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:31.040]   If you talk to Matt Mullenweg, who is the founder of WordPress, runs parent company is automatic,
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:37.200]   he has a podcast called distributed, and he's kind of a big evangelist for distributed work.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:45.120]   He will tell you that you do need to have in-person gatherings. Automatic does an annual all hands
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:49.040]   meeting, but they don't have to meet at their headquarters. They don't have a headquarters.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:56.640]   At whatever cool location in the world they want to go to. But for them, that's important.
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:03.520]   And I agree with Brianna. I think what we'll see is maybe a kind of a hybrid thing that will
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:10.160]   happen. I can see here at the Chronicle, we are all working remotely. I can see us maybe not
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.720]   necessarily always coming back to the newsroom every day, but maybe a couple of times a week.
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:19.440]   We're in the newsroom. I think you're going to see a combination.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:26.880]   Go ahead, Mike. You also have to consider the fact that working from home is really something
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:34.560]   that is or is not amenable to your personality. Some of us are self-driven introverts who are
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:40.000]   self-directed, and we need time to think and we need control over our own thought process.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.360]   Lots of other people get a lot more energy and ideas from being around other people and interacting
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:51.520]   and so on. And so I think the best case scenario is that the work-from-home situation reflects
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:59.040]   not just some blanket company policy, but actually reflects the preferences of individual personalities.
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:03.280]   So the people who really thrive working from home can do so. And the people who really thrive in
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:10.960]   an office environment can do that. One ironic slow-moving catastrophe is that
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:17.200]   several major Silicon Valley companies, specifically Facebook, but also Google, just invested
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:24.720]   gazillions of dollars in these massive open office plans. Facebook in particular has the world's
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:31.280]   largest open office in Menlo Park. And just as soon as they had that up and running for a year or two,
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:38.640]   along comes a virus that spreads like wildfire in an open office. And so this is kind of an ironic
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.640]   thing that companies are going to have to deal with. Even those Silicon Valley companies and elsewhere,
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.080]   they're going to have to figure out how to sort of wall people off to a certain extent,
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:51.440]   because Facebook like open offices are not going to fly in a world of global pandemics.
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:56.000]   Microsoft used to always have an office, have offices, right? I don't think Microsoft embraced
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:01.440]   open offices unless they have more recently. But all the new guys, I mean, look at Apple's campus,
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:09.840]   that's all open. And I do agree with you, Brianna, I feel like, for instance, Twitter is a really
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.800]   good example. The Twitter was in the South Park of San Francisco and a bunch of startups started
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:19.600]   up around that because they would see each other, they'd run into each other, they'd have lunch
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:25.680]   together. And there was this collegial aspect, it was one of the reasons San Francisco had such a
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:31.920]   great startup scene is because everybody was there. And there is something to be said for that Steve
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:39.760]   Jobs famously in the new Apple campus, initial and the initial design only had one bathroom per floor.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:46.320]   So because he wanted people to all kind of run into each other as they walked a mile and a half
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.320]   to get to the bathroom. I hope they didn't have an open office plan inside of it.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:57.440]   I think they better, Sainer minds talked him out of it. But initially, he really wanted,
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:02.640]   like, we don't want so many bathrooms. That's typical Steve, right? Here's the guy who washes
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:07.440]   feet in the toilet. So I, you know, who knows it's Steve? Yeah, but think about this,
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:12.640]   our company like Twitter that is really, they've had some tough problems, right? Like,
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:18.000]   gamergate happened at Twitter because let's just really be honest here. It was a bunch of white
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.840]   dudes that designed it and they didn't think about harassment and didn't invest in trust and safety.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:31.760]   And they had to have hard conversations and redo features and they tried slapping band-aids on it.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:39.040]   I can tell you for a fact there are people at Twitter that put everything on the line to improve
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:44.640]   it. And Twitter today is a drastically better product today than it was during gamergate.
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:56.320]   I'm unsure how effective that advocacy could have been in an all work-from-home situation.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:01.200]   Maybe it could have. I don't know. My husband's work, you know, he does patent law for a living.
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:05.920]   His job is barely effective. In fact, it's easier for him to write patents without all the meetings.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:13.440]   But I just, I wonder, I could see it working better for a company that's more static in what
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:20.320]   they produce or is that smaller. But when you get to the size of a big company, you invariably have
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:26.960]   people with competing goals, different agendas, different cultures. And I think some of that clash
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:32.000]   has to happen in person. Yeah. So do you think going back to our original conversation that these
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:39.200]   virtual reality glasses and the 3D mapped skeletal frame would help that or is it not enough?
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:44.240]   It would. No, I do. There was a back before I decided to run for office. There was a VR tech
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:50.080]   I was looking at. They had eye tracking with it. So for the skeletal mesh, I would look at it if
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:55.840]   I was looking over here and you look at it, then the eyes would turn and look you dead in the eye.
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:02.960]   It was such a emotionally connected effect. Yes. Yes. Yes. It produced something. So I do think it
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:08.000]   could have very good. I think it could help build that human connection. How interesting.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:13.920]   Yeah. In fact, Twitter itself said that one of the reasons they were able to get out of their
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:21.360]   fail-will situation was that their engineers would talk to other engineers at other startups
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:25.680]   in the area that were trying to figure out how to scale and the information shared that way
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:32.800]   actually helped them become a more scalable product. So there's a lot to be said for collegiality.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:37.120]   But unfortunately, most of us in the computer industry are introverts. I'm very happy
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:47.520]   at home writing up our patents. One last story. I want this from it's from the Stuff May Here
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:59.440]   YouTube channel. It is Shane Whaiton's robotic basketball hoop. This is what happens when nerds
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:06.560]   are locked in the house for a lengthy period of time. If you can't shoot hoops, well, you could
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:13.520]   get a Raspberry Pi to make sure that every single basket goes in. Thank you, Shane. Love this.
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:20.000]   This is what I need for sure. Mike Elgin, I'm sorry that you're stuck in the United States,
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.200]   but I guess you're having a good time with Princess Squishy Face and the fam.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:28.800]   And quick thing you said, you wanted to talk about positive things. We've been fermenting
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:34.400]   everything. Wow, this is blurry. You got the Skype blur on. That's why it can only your nose is in
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:40.640]   focus. Okay, so this is actually something my wife just made. This is Tapache. This is fermented
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:47.840]   pineapple rind. Oh, so this is a, this is actually a, an Aztec drink. These did make it with corn.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:51.280]   And when the Spanish started bringing in pineapples to Mexico, they started making it with pineapple,
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:56.800]   but it's, it's pineapple rind with water and pill and CEO, you'll sit around for a week or two,
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:03.840]   and it becomes this delicious alcoholic beverage. OMG. Yeah, it's so good. So try it. If you're
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:09.040]   going to cut open a pineapple, just take the, the peel, just throw it in a jar, put some water in
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:14.560]   there and some sugar and it will ferment on its own using the microbes that are on the pineapple.
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:18.000]   I think we're all learning at how important fermentation is.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:25.920]   Ferment all the things. I've got my little sourdough starter. It's bubbling away. This is, this is
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:34.240]   COVID-19 fermentation class. That's right. This life. Somebody mentioned that it was like a
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:40.640]   conspiracy among the microbes. It was COVID-19. The coronavirus was there to get us all to use
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:46.320]   these other microbes. So, so you put the, just the pineapple rind in there with some sugar,
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:51.920]   she's using what some special sugar, pill and CEO, the Mexican sugar, and you, you could also use
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:57.760]   brown sugar. Unrefined sugar she's using. But, and then, and then how long does it take to ferment?
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:02.800]   Anywhere between probably three or four days to, I don't know, a couple of weeks,
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:06.720]   she did this for three weeks. If you keep going, it becomes something that they call,
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:12.720]   in Central America, they call it chichae, which is a highly alcoholic. This still has some sugar in
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:19.440]   it. So, so it's still sweet. Yeah. So, if you, if you let the fermentation devour all that sugar,
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:24.160]   it's going to convert that into alcohol and you're going to have a drinking problem. So,
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:30.480]   or an opportunity. That's the beauty of fermentation. You can, you know, you can, I can quit anytime.
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:39.600]   And, right. It won't, but you could. Thank you, Mike Elgin. Elgin.com is his website. Subscribe
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:47.280]   to his newsletter full of wild and fun stuff. I love the things you're finding at Mike Elgin on
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:51.840]   Twitter. It's always a pleasure to see you. And give my love to Kevin and the gang and
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:57.600]   princesses on my face in a mirror and miss you all. I'll tell you what, if there's one group of
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:02.160]   people I'd want to hang out with right now, it'd be you guys. Thank you. Believe it.
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:09.200]   Likewise. Yeah. Dwight Silverman. He is at the Houston Chronicle at the tech burger.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:14.000]   Houston Chronicle.com/techburger. What else are you doing these days?
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.520]   Well, I have a newsletter that I launched. I think I just launched it when I think I was last on.
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:23.920]   Yep. It's called "Least Notes." It's every Monday morning. You can get it at
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:31.840]   Houston Chronicle.com/releasenotes. And it is the most in newsletter world, what you want to do is
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:37.440]   you want to have your newsletters be opened in the email rather than just sit as a header.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.320]   And I'm really happy that "Least Notes" is the most open newsletter at the Chronicle.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:48.800]   Nice. So, yes. I'm really pleased with that. And in fact, I finished it just while I was waiting
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:53.840]   to connect to you guys, I was finally finishing it. I had rushed over here and I had like two more
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:59.840]   stories to write. And so I did them while I wasn't able to connect to you. So I appreciate the delay.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:05.360]   Yes. Perfect. You see, you're so efficient. We don't need to go to work. We could just...
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.040]   We'll do it all from home. That's right.
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:13.920]   Brianna Wu's got a new toy. I know she's anxious to get to her 14 core. How many cores?
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:16.560]   14 core iMac. I Mac.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:24.960]   I got that. So CDW is canceling. They have corporate customers. They're canceling tons of
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:29.680]   orders. I have a friend of mine that works with them. So that machine, if you bought that new from
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:38.880]   Apple, that would cost you about $7,500. I got it for $5,800. You're going to love it.
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:46.080]   My main machine is a... John, I put up the CDW site because I was hoping she was going to say
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:52.400]   you could buy it. But it turns out she has a friend. I have a friend. John saying, "Let's see,
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:57.680]   where is it? I know I want to... But I love my iMac Pro. That is my go-to machine. And I know they
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:02.800]   have a newer Mac Pro with more cores and more power and stuff. That iMac Pro is very, very sweet
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:08.080]   machine. And I have two cinematists plays running off it. So it's a three. The only thing... I'm very
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:14.960]   jealous because Lisa has the biggest freaking monitor I've ever seen. It's like a... It's a
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:22.880]   a D-arm span. It's like a six. It's like 57 inch curved. It's crazy. The thing is because I have an
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:29.120]   iMac, I can't really do that. And I kind of almost wish I could. But I do love that iMac. It's a
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:34.640]   beauty. So you have two of the Thunderbolt displays. The old 24 inch. No, yes. So one of them's
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:40.480]   Thunderbolt and one of them's DisplayPort or maybe Thunderbolt 2. I can't remember. Yeah, I had to
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:44.640]   get an adapter. Is it the ACD? Yeah. Yeah. I had to get an adapter. I'll send you the
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:48.800]   the way it worked. But yeah, you can... Yeah, it's three Apple to... It's iMac plus two Apple
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:54.240]   displays. And it's great. Oh, that's good. I have two of those. Yes. You just need the adapters.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:57.920]   I have a plug in. Yeah. Yeah. And what I think I ended up doing from other world computing,
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:01.920]   they make a docs because I needed one extra DisplayPort or something like that. And then I
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:06.240]   was able to do it and I've been doing that. And it's great. It's really nice to have the real estate.
[02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:12.160]   I was worried the Vegas 64 wouldn't drive a sick monitor with a good frame rate. Oh, yeah. It
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:19.920]   looks good. That's got a lot of oomph. Thank you, Brandon. I'm really sorry that you're not going to
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:25.440]   be in Congress in January. I'm not excited about that. I am too. It's not giving up a drink.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:29.760]   Maybe you'll be there lobbying for us. That would be a good thing. And I would certainly
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:33.680]   contribute to a political action committee that was run by Brianna Wu. That's for sure.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.360]   I'm going to take some time. I'm going to play some video games. I'm going to get to know my husband.
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:43.040]   Again, who I've not spent too much time with in the last couple of years. And we're going to take
[02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:48.800]   it from there. Yeah. I need some time to reground myself. I think, and by the way,
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:52.960]   Inspire for you, our next show will be doing Round the Campfire and Red Dead Redemption. I
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:07:02.640]   think that sounds like a great way to do it. Would that be fun? Totally. Yeah. Mike could bring the
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:10.080]   Red Eye. Yeah. Yeah. We do this show every Sunday afternoon, Round 230, Pacific 530, Eastern
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:16.960]   2130 UTC. If you want to participate, watch live, chat along with the show. The first thing to do
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:22.640]   is go to the live stream audio or video at twit.tv/live and then go into the chat room.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:28.560]   And IRC.twit.tv. You can use your web browser or an IRC client. Great bunch of people. They're
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:35.120]   there all week long. So if you get lonely in your quarantine and you wish you had some geeks to hang
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:44.080]   out with any time of the day or night, there's always somebody at IRC.twit.tv. If you can't be
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:51.920]   here live, of course, because we are a netcast, you can get the show at our website. All right,
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:57.760]   it's a podcast, twit.tv. All of our shows are there. Download them on demand. And the other thing you
[02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:02.480]   could do is use a podcast player and subscribe. That way you'll get it the minute it's available
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:07.840]   and that would help us too. Thank you everybody. Stay safe, stay well. We'll see you next week. Another
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:19.760]   Twit. Do it.
