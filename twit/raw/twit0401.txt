[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.300]   It's time for TWIT This Week in Tech, the show where we talk about the tech news of the week.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.300]   I don't know what this is going to be like, this show. If the pre-show is anything, any indicator, fasten your seatbelts, kids.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.300]   You're in for a bumpy ride. First, let me introduce Lamar Wilson, who came up from LA as a YouTuber to do our This Week in YouTube episode one.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.300]   Episode one of This Week in YouTube. I think it went great.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.300]   It was so nice to have you. It's nice to be. For some reason, I just feel like I know you so well.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   I was stunned to learn you'd actually, we'd actually never met.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.300]   We still haven't met because I have an invisible barrier between you and me right now.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.300]   Yeah, I'm not even here. I'm just broadcasting from home.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   It was great to have you. You're welcome. So nice to meet you finally.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   Thank you.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.300]   And you've been on TWIT before. You've been on other shows before. We've never met in person.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.300]   Yeah, good to be here, man.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   All right, you know, there's so many people I haven't met, but here's two guys I have. I've known for years, many, many years. Roger Chang.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.300]   Hello.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.300]   Producer at Tekzilla and the host. And what else do you do these days?
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.300]   I am also a producer for Downloaded.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   You know, you've got to put the mic in front of the laptop, not behind it, unless you're speaking into the laptop.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   That's the Jim Latterback show. Basically, you said a ripoff of Cranky Geeks.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300]   No, it's like Cranky Geeks with a lot of food.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   Oh, so they can't take it. They just, you know, we do these things. The next thing you know, people are just stealing them left and right.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.300]   Copying left and right. Actually, this show is a ripoff of Cranky Geeks, except it predates it.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   So I guess that Cranky Geeks would be a ripoff of this show.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.300]   No, this show and Cranky Geeks was never designed to be similar.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.300]   Well, they're both ripoffs of Silicon Spin, really.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.300]   Right. Silicon Spin, yeah.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.300]   Which is a ripoff of the first pilot I made for CNET, which John was on.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.300]   How far is this going to go back?
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.300]   Which is a ripoff of the Botland Group.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   Wrong.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   Wrong. So it's all a ripoff of everything else.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.300]   You just need the jowls.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   John C. Dvorak is here. Channeldvorak.com.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.300]   I'm here.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.300]   He's a major Bitcoin advocate and he's here to tell us all about the new currency that's sweeping America.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.300]   Yeah, absolutely. Bitcoin is for you.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.300]   You know what? We could talk about Bitcoin because there's still a little energy in the room
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   because we were talking before the show about it. I read a book.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.300]   You're a big fan of Bitcoin.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   I'm not. I just think it's very interesting.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.300]   Why?
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:20.300]   Well, of course, the first place that we got interested in was just merely the cryptographic mathematical background of it,
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:27.300]   which is kind of interesting. For those who don't know, Bitcoin is a non-governmental currency
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.300]   that is generated by solving very hard numeric problems.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   You assign a computer to do it. In the early days, it was easy. It gets harder and harder.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.300]   And there's a limited number of Bitcoins, I believe 21 million, which they expect will be fully in circulation by 2140.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   It's going to take a while.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   How do they know there's that many? A) And B) if they know there's that many?
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.300]   It's artificially set at that many.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.300]   Okay, then how do they?
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   And that's to make it deflationary, to not be inflationary, right?
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.300]   I don't care. It's bullcrap.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.300]   Well, I agree. There's a point to that. It's maybe a deflationary currency.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.300]   Now, how do they know you have a legitimate Bitcoin?
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.300]   Oh, there's a very good system for storing Bitcoins. There's no physical entity, of course. There's no coin in Bitcoins.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   No, it's a number.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.300]   It's a number.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.300]   That you'd mine.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   And you'd mine and you have a wallet.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.300]   But there's no mining involved. There's no hosier, shovels.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.300]   No, the mining is solving a tough mathematical problem.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.300]   What's interesting is that...
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.300]   Is it the same mathematical problem every time?
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.300]   No, it's a variety of things.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.300]   And then why would it be different? And why would that make a coin?
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   Because it's an invention.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.300]   Couldn't this better use of this work and effort be put someplace else?
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:41.300]   Well, that's an interesting point because somebody just estimated about $150,000 a year in energy cost to generating the Bitcoin because Bitcoin miners...
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.300]   One Bitcoin?
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.300]   No, no. The current amount of Bitcoin being generated every year.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.300]   So much.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.300]   Because in order to generate Bitcoins, it gets harder and harder. It's designed to get harder and harder.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.300]   It's an interesting story. It's designed by a guy who is anonymous. Maybe a group we don't know.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.300]   Does that make you suspicious?
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.300]   Well, no, because you don't really want to become well known as a guy developing an extra governmental...
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.300]   You don't think it's Max Keiser?
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.300]   He's got an exchange maybe?
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.300]   $150,000 a day.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.300]   In power consumption.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.300]   A day.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.300]   Oh, so it's for the greenies.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.300]   So, yeah, I'm trying to find the... I mean, the value itself is just set by the market and whatever...
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   That's right. And there are a number of exchanges, the best known as Mt. Gox.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.300]   But the problem is it's an asset. And like any asset, it's going to suffer...
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.300]   It's not a physical asset, however.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:40.300]   But it doesn't matter. I mean, mentally when people approach it, I mean, real estate, it might be a physical asset, but when people deal with it, it's through dollar transactions, typically through your bank, and all you see is a bunch of numbers.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.300]   So would you rather have a Bitcoin and just some...
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.300]   I can't sleep on a Bitcoin and I can't eat a Bitcoin. And I can't fashion a weapon out of a Bitcoin.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:56.300]   The thing that I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it's really saying something a little bit about currency in general, which is it is...
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.300]   Our currency, the greenback dollar, which is probably the most trusted currency in the world...
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.300]   It's the only reserve currency in the world.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.300]   At the moment.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:12.300]   ...is what they call a fiat currency. Its value exists purely because of the faith of the users. The faith in the US government, of course.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.300]   I don't see that any different than gold. The value of gold is...
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.300]   Very similar, because there's some physical value to gold.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.300]   Except there's a minimum.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.300]   But it's not much. It's certainly not...
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.300]   But you can't just print gold.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.300]   Right.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.300]   But it's still that same kind of thing. It's imaginary.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:32.300]   But once the dollar was eliminated from gold and silver backing in the days of Nixon, then it really was just a piece of paper, right?
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   Well, actually, let's start with Roosevelt, who confiscated all the gold.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:42.300]   Right. So the thing that I find interesting is that there can, A, be an extra-governmental currency.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.300]   And the notion of Bitcoin is that it protects privacy. Just as cash protects privacy.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.300]   Although, apparently, every Bitcoin transaction is so carefully traced that it doesn't protect privacy at all.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.300]   Well, the only identity you know is... you have a numeric identity. You don't have a real identity.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:05.300]   But you do have an identity that can be tracked back somehow, if somebody wanted to. If the NSA wanted to find out who numbers 666668910...
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.300]   That's interesting. I don't know.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.300]   They could do that and then you say, "Well, that guy's been buying a lot of drugs. How does this protect anything?"
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:16.300]   That's actually the main use right now of Bitcoin is the imaginary website Silk Road, where people are buying drugs with Bitcoin.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.300]   The imaginary site.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.300]   Well, you can't go to silkroad.com. You have to kind of...
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.300]   You have to know the secret handshake password.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:28.300]   That's what I was going to ask. Like, I'm a little ignorant on this subject. Like, what is it mainly used for? Would you kind of answer that?
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:36.300]   Well, no. But it's not designed to be used in any way different from money. Though I think what it is is kind of an interesting philosophical...
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.300]   It's a great way to basically launder money.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:44.300]   But no, but what is money really, right? Money is imaginary. Money is an agreed...
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   It's a social con-
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.300]   It's a social con-
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.300]   It's a social con-
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.300]   Absolutely.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.300]   It's essentially a...
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.300]   And it doesn't have to be backed by a government. In fact, it was only recently in the last hundred or so years that government had anything to do with it.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.300]   But gold isn't backed by government and people were trading those... You know, go to any kind of...
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.300]   Your people were trading jade, as you said.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   Jade.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.300]   Jade.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.300]   Blue feathers.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:13.300]   Anything. Yap stones. Giant, oversized, impractical means of trade. But I mean, people have all agreed, at least up to a point, that, you know, you have...
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.300]   Well, I think it's also interesting that Bitcoin arouses such energy in people like John.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.300]   I would think you'd be in favor because it's a currency that is private and non-governmental.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.300]   It's not private, I just mentioned. Non-governmental doesn't bother me.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.300]   It's private.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.300]   I could go trade, you know, euros if I didn't want to be hounded by the US government.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.300]   And be hounded by the...
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.300]   You.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:44.300]   Worse. I don't like it because it's suspect. It's got this unknown origin. It's trading at all kinds of different weird prices.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.300]   You've got Max Keiser coming out saying it's going to be worth $100,000 a coin, maybe a million.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:56.300]   You know, there's a great story, which I'm sure is well floated among Bitcoin users, of the guy who a couple of years ago bought a pizza with Bitcoin,
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   which at the time was worth a few bucks, but now would be about $1.6 million, a very expensive pizza.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300]   Yeah, to say the least.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.300]   Because there's a lot of speculation in Bitcoin. Bitcoin's been very volatile. It went up a lot.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:13.300]   It was just at a record high and almost immediately plummeted because there was a big sell-off on Mt. Gox.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.300]   There's the plummet right there on the graph.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:24.300]   Actually, there's a conspiracy behind that or conspiracy theory behind that, that people are trying to drive up or a group of people are trying to drive up the price of Bitcoin,
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   and they sell, causing the value of the Bitcoin to drop.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   And then they buy some more.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   And they buy some more. So they basically...
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:39.300]   It's speculation. It's absolutely, I would say, vulnerable to that kind of speculation, especially as people like us and lots of people in the geek community and lots of...
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:48.300]   Well, this is one of the things that bothers me is I'll bring up this distrust, let's say, of Bitcoin, and I'll get a whole bunch of stuff flack from,
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:56.300]   "Oh, you're a technologist. I don't understand how you don't subscribe to this. You're an idiot. You obviously don't understand the mechanism."
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   And they go on and on, and this whole thing just kind of reeks of just some sour weirdness that I really don't trust at all.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:09.300]   Well, that's why you don't trust, because you don't fully understand the mechanism, and you're not going to put your money into something that some people do.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:20.300]   I would submit it's even worse than that. I think that people don't really want to think about the fact that there's nothing at all supporting the value of currency, that it is merely a consensual hallucination.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:26.300]   We don't really want to delve into the fact that paper money or even U.S. coins have no real value.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:36.300]   It's what we say it is. And the fact that the government two years ago printed billions of new dollars out of nowhere is unsettling to people.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.300]   It works, and in fact that may be one of the flaws of Bitcoin, is that you can't make new Bitcoin.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:48.300]   You can only make, by the end of the game, 21 million. If people hoard it, it's very deflationary, because you can't...
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   I mean, that was one of the issues with the gold standards. You cannot get enough gold to actually cover everything, unless you decide to make...
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   Well, you could use the same model that the Bitcoins have, and you just keep subdividing.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:07.300]   There's a limited number of bout of gold in the world, although they do find some every once in a while, which is like printing money the way I see it.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:17.300]   But anyway, well mainly because in 1949 during the gold rush, there was something like $30 trillion of new gold and silver injected into the economy by today's numbers.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:23.300]   Anyway, so you could do what Bitcoin does with gold if you wanted to, but people shave the coins...
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.300]   It's true. Bitcoin can be infinitely divided.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.300]   Which in a way kind of...
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.300]   People give me fractional Bitcoins. We accept Bitcoin donations. Not because I... It's just because it's fun.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   And people want us to do that, and I said fine. We've received about one and a half Bitcoins over the last few weeks.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.300]   Does Ford pay you in Bitcoins?
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   No, we better not. We want Mac and Dollar.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   There it is. As fiat as that currency is, you'll take it, happily.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.300]   Well, I find it fascinating, and I don't really have an interest one way or the other in it.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:04.300]   But I do think it's... I'm actually reading a great book called The End of Money that's about this whole notion of what is money.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   Why, for instance, do we not move to an electronic currency? Why do we have pennies? Why do we have coins?
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:15.300]   So you'd rather have electronic everything so we can be tracked like dogs.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.300]   Well, that's exactly who's against it, which is why I was so surprised that you were so anti-Bitcoin, because that's the point.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.300]   Is your savings in your mattress?
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.300]   Yes.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.300]   As opposed to leaving your mattress.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.300]   Where's your mattress? Just so I know for future reference, in case anything happens to you.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.300]   Yeah, somewhere you won't find it.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.300]   It's in a guest mattress.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.300]   Bitcoin's currently at 96.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.300]   That's very low, because they were well over 200 bucks on Wednesday.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.300]   Ludicrous.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:46.300]   So there's been a Bitcoin crash. I think it's fascinating. I frankly don't care, and I would like everything to be electronic.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:53.300]   Dollars have a huge cost. But it is the only way we can anonymously transact.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:14:02.300]   You can barter stuff. I mean, money is essentially a universal agreement on what medium of exchange you use.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.300]   There are Ithaca dollars.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.300]   Let's take a look at what's going on in the EU.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.300]   Yeah, and they're useless outside of it.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.300]   But in Ithaca, they're worth cash money.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.300]   Hey, strip clubs have been doing this for years.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.300]   Really?
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.300]   Yes.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.300]   Use strip dollars.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.300]   Trip clubs, Disney, Microsoft, Pinball Machine Places.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   So anyway, you have this all electronic thing.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.300]   So what happens is the government decides that they're doing it, or they did in Cyprus,
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   and they're probably going to do it in the Netherlands, in the midst of the EU.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:37.300]   They just say, "Okay, let's take 10% of your money to help support us."
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   And you can't even get that money out because it's all electronic.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:48.300]   And by the way, the Dutch have long since done everything they can to get actual coinage out of the system.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   Everything's about ripping off the public.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.300]   What's that book called that you're reading?
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.300]   I highly recommend it. It's on Audible. It's called The End of Money.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.300]   I will check that because I'm interested in that subject.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   And it's easy to understand, and it raises some very interesting issues.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.300]   They mentioned Bitcoin briefly, but it was written a couple of years ago
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.300]   before Bitcoin really got a lot of attention and notoriety.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   But there are many other choices. There's Litecoin. There are other cryptocurrencies out there.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.300]   I love when the Kindle is brought up.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.300]   There's The End of Money, Counterfeiters, Preachers, Techies, Dreamers, and the coming cashless society by David Wolman.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:28.300]   Can any of those problems-solving that the machines do,
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.300]   can any of those be geared toward solving a particular...
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.300]   No, they have no value.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   You mean like curing cancer? No.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.300]   They let me burn up energy so I can make an imaginary currency
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.300]   so I can pay some guy on an illicit, non-existent website.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   So you get some pot.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   So I can get some pot when I can just drive over the border to like BC and buy like a...
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   People are buying special heavy GPU machines, because the GPU is better at doing this, for Bitcoin mining.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.300]   And there may be some reason to do that.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.300]   You have to do some calculations to the energy cost, the cost of the hardware.
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.300]   But if you can generate enough Bitcoin fast enough...
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.300]   Steve Gibson, who hosts Security Now...
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.300]   He generated a Bitcoin?
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.300]   He generated 50 Bitcoins, but it was a couple of years ago when it was easier.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.300]   You know, it gets harder and harder.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   So those 50 Bitcoins, at its peak, were worth more than $10,000.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.300]   I hope he cashed out.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.300]   He did not.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.300]   So now there was $5,000.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.300]   Buy low, sell high.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   But that's an interesting question.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   Should you cash out or are they...
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.300]   Remember, it's a limited supply.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.300]   They may go up.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.300]   They could be worth $100 to $1 million a piece.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.300]   This sounds very familiar. It's like gambling almost.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.300]   By the way, each Bitcoin can be subdivided into 100 million smaller units.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:45.300]   Those are called Satoshis after the imaginary guy, Satoshi Nakamoto, who created Bitcoin.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   So I can give you a couple of Satoshis.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.300]   You give me a pizza. We're happy.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.300]   How about you just give me...
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.300]   Oh, you're happy.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.300]   Give me real currency.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   It uses public key crypto.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.300]   It's, you know, technically sophisticated.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:04.300]   And people who are smarter than me have looked at it and said, "No, it all works mathematically."
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.300]   From a practical standpoint, ultimately though, is when I go to a store,
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   I can be 99.9% assured that if I give them $10 as payment, they'll accept it.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.300]   I'm not going to go up to a Walmart or a McDonald's or something.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.300]   "Hey, I got some Bitcoins. They're going to look at me. So what the hell is that?"
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   Right.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   Like, they're not going to give me my...
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   Actually, please try it in McDonald's. I think that'd be hilarious.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.300]   Just to see what they're going to do.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.300]   But you can trade Bitcoin in for...
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.300]   But it's impractical.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   ...dollars if you wish.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   Yeah, it's impractical. You know what? I want to eat now.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.300]   I don't want to go home and freaking convert it and then get the electronic transaction
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.300]   and then run over to an ATM to get the cash out.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.300]   I just want a burger. 99 cents.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Support Greenback Dollars. See how that gets you.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.300]   You know, they could print more of those anytime.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   If you hate it so much, I'll take it up.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   I don't hate it. I don't hate it. I love it.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.300]   I think it's more, for me, an intellectual exercise, and it's one that geeks are very interested in
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.300]   because of the mathematics involved, but also because in this notion that...
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.300]   I think what I celebrate among geeks is that they're willing sometimes to tackle stuff...
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.300]   You celebrate it.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:13.300]   ...that scares people. And what's scary to people is this notion that there is nothing really backing the value of a dollar.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.300]   That's not scary. It's idiotic. It's different than being scared.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.300]   "Oh, I'm scared. Oh, there's nothing backing the dollar. I'm frightened. I'm shaking in my boots."
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.300]   But our whole life relies on that value.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.300]   If you understand the mechanism, it's like, "What do we do?"
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.300]   Sir, our lives are a lie.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.300]   Yeah, our lives are a lie.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.300]   It's a lie. It's a lie, I say.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.300]   Haven't there been at least a half dozen movies that have told us that in some fashion?
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.300]   I think, in general, people would prefer not to think about that. They love the idea. That's why they like the idea.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.300]   People don't like thinking about dying either. It happens.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.300]   A gold backer, a silver backer. And I think that's what I celebrate about geeks is they're willing to kind of think a little bit harder...
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   Celebrate.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   ...about the notion of fiat currency, what that means, and what Bitcoin means about it.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   And I don't know if Bitcoin's going to be big or it's a ripoff or any of that. I don't know.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.300]   But I think it's intriguing. I think it's an interesting... it makes an interesting point about...
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   On to topic two.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   Topic two, CISPA. We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:12.300]   The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which, by the way, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo all are in favor of,
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.300]   others, like privacy advocates, a little bit worried about.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.300]   We'll talk about CISPA in just a moment.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   But meanwhile, let's talk about GoToMeeting with HD Faces from Citrix.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:31.300]   If you meet with staffers on a regular basis, you know how hard it can be nowadays to get people together.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:36.300]   If you pitch to clients, you know how hard sometimes it can be to get an appointment with a client.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.300]   But I've got a way you can meet. You can pitch. You can train. You can collaborate.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   It's easy. It doesn't require people to be in the same place. And in fact, it's even more effective than if they were.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.300]   GoToMeeting allows you to share your screens. And you know, when you're on the same screen, you're on the same page.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.300]   You can see the PowerPoint presentation, the keynote presentation, what we're working on together.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:02.300]   You can collaborate on documents. But it also now, with the new HD Faces feature, allows you to see who you're meeting with.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.300]   That's very important. If you're pitching a client, you want to know if he's got his arms folded and frowning,
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.300]   or if she's smiling and saying, "I like that product." That's really important.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   GoToMeeting lets you work face-to-face with anyone, anywhere.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:22.300]   In the old days, people would pay literally thousands, maybe tens of thousands of dollars for this kind of HD video conferencing.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.300]   You can have it now on your desktop for a lot less than you might think. In fact, it's free for the first 30 days.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.300]   So try it out. GoToMeeting.com. Click the Try It Free button. Use the promo code TWIT.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   The powerfully simple way to meet and collaborate online.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:43.300]   And now, by the way, you can go to meetings, not just on your Mac or your PC, but on smartphones, on tablets.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:49.300]   They even let you present from an iPad. So you can be sitting in an airport presenting a meeting, pitching.

[00:20:53.300 --> 00:21:00.300]   We thank them for their support in American government-backed currency of this week in tech.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:06.300]   Although I'd take Bitcoin. You know, one of the reasons we take Bitcoin is because maybe somebody would give me Bitcoin and now it's worth $100.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.300]   But next year it's worth a million bucks so I could cash out and move to the Bahamas.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:14.300]   You don't think that's going to happen? John Zinks, I'm nuts!
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.300]   Wishful thinking. Nice thought.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.300]   What's interesting is that you still convert everything into dollars.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.300]   We're on the topic, too.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.300]   What if I gave you a Bitcoin? Would you turn it down?
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.300]   What does it look like? I've never seen one.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.300]   No, you have a wallet. I have a wallet.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   I have to go sign up someplace, get on a mailing list. I can get spam for the rest of it.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.300]   No, it's free open source software. You're completely anonymous. You download it, you run it.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.300]   You create a unique 30-digit address.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.300]   What would I do?
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   And then I'll give you a coin.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.300]   Then you do whatever you want.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.300]   I'd sell it immediately.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.300]   You probably would. It's worth $100. It's like me giving you $100.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:52.300]   Why don't you just give me $100? We'll skip the middleman.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft all say they back CISPA.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.300]   In fact, the group which...
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.300]   Hold on a second. Before you go and finish the read,
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.300]   don't these guys back every one of these crazy things that comes along?
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.300]   Microsoft, Cisco, all these guys.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   Every time something crazy comes along, some law that's going to just pretty much spy on the public.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.300]   These same companies, every single time, "Yeah, we're all for it."
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.300]   The reason we noticed this, they're backing it. They don't like the other law.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.300]   They don't like the other law with the internet kill switch.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.300]   We're going to cyber security.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.300]   They just don't talk about it.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.300]   CISPA is designed, its supporters have said, this is Declan McCullough writing...
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.300]   I'm sorry, it's Edward Moyer writing in CNET,
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:45.300]   to protect against foreign cyber threats by allowing private companies to...
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.300]   John, you're going to love this, voluntarily share data with government intelligence agencies.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.300]   We like to put the government in bed with corporations in this country
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.300]   so we can get closer and closer to what is defined as fascism,
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.300]   where government and the corporations work in conjunction with each other.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.300]   But aren't you worried about foreign cyber threats?
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.300]   By who? The North Koreans?
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.300]   Foreigners!
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.300]   The two guys in North Korea that can code in BASIC?
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.300]   Kim Il-sung has a Mac. I saw it on his desk.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   By the way, a violation of the... explicit violation of Apple's Terms of Service,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   which say you cannot use a Macintosh computer to create weapons of mass destruction,
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   bioterrorist war, or anything like that.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.300]   Is that in your...
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.300]   Yes, it's actually in the Terms of Service!
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.300]   So what happens?
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.300]   Smart move.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.300]   What are they going to do? Go in there and repossess it?
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.300]   Yeah!
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   Give me that!
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.300]   That's why you get a Chromebook.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   There's no such thing as volunteering.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.300]   Mac...
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.300]   Just arm-twisting.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   I've got to see if I can find the Macintosh...
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   By the way, it's not even a modern Mac.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.300]   If you look at the... it's an old iMac.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.300]   They don't have a more modern Macintosh.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.300]   I always find it unusual when you start to see stuff like this.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   Here's a little opposition listing in the Wikipedia, the Book of Knowledge.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.300]   "U.S. Representative Ron Paul publicly opposed the bill, calling it 'Big Brother writ large,'"
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.300]   which I would agree.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   And then that guy, Cenk Olgur, that left-wing...
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.300]   Isn't it interesting? It's bringing strange bedfellows.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.300]   The edges.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.300]   The edges are coming in.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.300]   Declan McCullough at CNET noted that "Under existing federal law, any person or company,
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.300]   existing law..." They don't need a new one for this.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:26.300]   "...who intercepts any wire, oral, or electric communication unless specifically authorized by law could face criminal charges,
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.300]   says no, no, no, no, it's okay.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.300]   Go ahead and intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communication
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.300]   as long as you're protecting us against foreign cyber threats
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   and passing it along to government intelligence, it's quite alright."
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   So it's basically overriding the state laws and the federal laws.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.300]   Does this mean if I'm a corporation and I want to just record everything,
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.300]   like in the street I have a recorder on me,
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.300]   I just wear a wire and I just record everything?
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   And all you have to say if CISPA passes is,
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   "Look, I was doing it to protect us against foreign cyber threats."
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   Well, I'm starting to like this now.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.300]   Good, isn't it?
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   Yeah, I could get a lot of good stories this way.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   The group that the advocacy group that these companies formed,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.300]   it's called TechNet, Marissa Meyer's on the council,
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.300]   Eric Schmidt, Microsoft general counsel, Brad Smith.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.300]   Will the Google glasses be used in this?
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   Oh, they're made for this.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   Yeah, I've heard of that.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.300]   This is what TechNet says,
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.300]   "CISPA recognizes the need for effective cybersecurity legislation
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   that encourages voluntary, bidirectional, real-time sharing
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   of actionable cyber threat information to protect networks."
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   So in other words, let's open up the communication
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.300]   between private industry and government
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.300]   under the guise of protecting against terrorism.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.300]   Terrorism is great for that.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.300]   Used to be child pornography.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   Now it's terrorism.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.300]   Well, terrorism is such a broad brush you can use against anything.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.300]   Yeah, those Chicago gangs are terrorists.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.300]   Trust me, I live there.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   Domestic.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   I know.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.300]   The ACLU says in its current form, CISPA empowers the military,
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.300]   including agencies like the NSA,
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:05.300]   to collect the Internet records of Americans' everyday Internet use.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.300]   We have a long-established principle the military is not permitted to spy on Americans.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   This would...
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.300]   But Leo, if I use a incognito window, I'm safe, right?
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   Right.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   Oh, that'll do it.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.300]   You're protected. No.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.300]   Just in case somebody believes you,
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.300]   of course your Internet service provider knows exactly what you're doing,
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.300]   regardless of your incognito window, and they're the ones who are saving the information
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.300]   and perhaps passing it along.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:34.300]   CISPA won the House Intelligence Committee's approval this week
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:39.300]   and will advance to the House floor, and a vote is expected sometime this week or the next.
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.300]   So would you all take this over...
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.300]   Like, we think about all the technology improvements
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.300]   and things that we're getting, all these cool things coming out.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.300]   Is it worth the trade-off?
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.300]   Because something has to give, I think, with...
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   I mean, I'm not for this, but I'm wondering, are we willing...
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.300]   Trade-off? What's the trade-off?
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.300]   I don't understand what you're saying.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.300]   Well, I'm just thinking about all, like, Google Glasses or the Watch
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.300]   or all these advancements that are coming that we don't even know about.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   Are getting those things worth giving up?
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.300]   I'm still not getting a connection here.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.300]   I don't know.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.300]   I've got a watch, I've got a watch, or to have this crappy watch...
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.300]   Because the watch is watching you.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.300]   Well, if that was the case.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   So I have a watch, and to accept a great watch,
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.300]   and then the technology, I say, "OK, yeah, give her all my privacy."
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   Well, you know you have to sign all these agreements
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.300]   with anything that you buy or anything that you use.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.300]   Replace watch with Facebook.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.300]   I don't use Facebook.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.300]   Why?
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.300]   Because I think it's dumb.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.300]   Oh.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.300]   Not because it's an invasion of your privacy.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.300]   Watch was an example, but you're right, Facebook's a good example.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.300]   Is it?
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.300]   I don't know. The CIA's an investor.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.300]   Well, then I'd be suspicious of using it.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.300]   Just don't put anything that's, you know, unheard of.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.300]   I think it's a good investment for the CIA.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.300]   They need some money.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.300]   Facebook's going to go places, I think.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.300]   Think?
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   It's going to be good.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.300]   It's going to save us tax dollars.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   Didn't you quit Facebook once and make a big stink about it?
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.300]   I did, and I couldn't.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.300]   Twice?
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   Twice.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.300]   Please.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.300]   Do I look like a double-quitter to you?
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.300]   I'm merely a single-quitter.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.300]   I thought it was twice.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.300]   Maybe I watched the episode twice.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.300]   I quit Twitter once.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.300]   I quit Twitter.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.300]   I was a Twitter-quitter, and then I was a Facebook-quitter.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   That's what it was.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   And then I'm both on back.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.300]   Because I can't do this job...
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   You need to go ahead and do it for the plus time.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.300]   ...unless I can talk about Facebook.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.800]   I can't go to Facebook home on my new phone when it comes on Wednesday, so that Mark Zuckerberg
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.300]   will know everywhere I go.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   He'll even know the humidity where I am.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.300]   I think it's bull.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.180]   I think you could do the show quite easily without having any Facebook connection.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.180]   You wouldn't lose one listener.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.180]   You managed to.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.180]   Yes.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.580]   I don't make your kind of money, but I don't attribute the money that you make to Facebook
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.580]   at all, in the least.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.580]   Or Twitter.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.300]   I like putting in symbolic protests, because it was when they changed the privacy policy.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.900]   You actually like to have all your pictures up, and you like that timeline thing.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.900]   I love that timeline.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.900]   I love that timeline.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.900]   Yeah, you got the new one.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.900]   How did they get that picture when I was six?
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:48.900]   You don't have the new one yet?
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.900]   I don't have the new one yet.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.900]   You got some magic sauce you can do?
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.900]   It's ugly.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.900]   It's not ugly.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.900]   It's attractive.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.900]   It's a Google+ bar on its side, right?
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.900]   Yeah, beautiful.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.900]   No, it looks like Google+.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.900]   Yeah, I don't have that either.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:28:59.900]   "Johannes rallied to tie in ninth and winning tenth, 10th to seventh."
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.900]   I don't have that or the new search.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.540]   See, look how big these pictures.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.540]   This is the new one.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.540]   You would like this.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.540]   This is good.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.540]   It's beautiful, big pictures.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:16.060]   John, if you love Google+, you'll love this.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.260]   Jason's wife, very pregnant, even though she has a tumor.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:22.380]   This picture's going to blow.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.300]   I think she's overdue now, right?
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.300]   Today was the day that she ...
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.300]   Today's the official day?
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   I shouldn't be showing this.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.300]   This is all private Facebook stuff.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.300]   Perhaps.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   Oh, what the hell.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.300]   It could be illegal.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.300]   I cut to it, so it's my fault.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.300]   It could be illegal.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   Anyway, I love it.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.300]   Look out.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.780]   You see, when Randall Schwartz checks in at Ote Mesa, whatever the hell that is, in Chula
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.780]   Vista ...
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.780]   I like the larger look, though.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.780]   Isn't that pretty?
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.780]   Yeah, I really do.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.780]   You can see a big map.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.780]   This is why I came back.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.780]   This is shit stuff.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.780]   This is Facebook.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.780]   How could you not use this?
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.780]   How do you keep up with family and friends?
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.780]   I love the Facebook home though.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.780]   He calls them alcohol and maybe.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.780]   No, wait a minute.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.780]   Let's be honest.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.780]   You don't.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.780]   Do I necessarily want to keep up with family and friends?
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.780]   You don't want to keep up with family and friends.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.780]   That's why.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.780]   You can't get the office clean.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.340]   If you were on Facebook, you would have seen this great picture of Kim ... What is his
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   name?
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.340]   Kim Il-young.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.340]   Kim Jong-un.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.780]   Kim Jong-un with his old iMac right there.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.780]   There it is.
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:15.780]   See that?
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.340]   I want this Facebook.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.340]   That's what you want.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.340]   You want this Facebook.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.140]   I have embraced ... I am all in on Facebook.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.740]   I got the Facebook home.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.220]   I moved all my pictures from Google Play.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.220]   Did you put Facebook home on your phone?
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.220]   Yep.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.220]   Let's take a look.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.220]   Let's see.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.220]   What's the appeal?
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.220]   Do you mind if I show?
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.220]   If I can ask.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.740]   What's the appeal for installing home?
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:42.540]   One thing you get immediately is ... This is your log screen, but you see One Direction.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.540]   That's not me.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.540]   This is random friends.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.540]   These are friends.
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.540]   This is his Facebook feed.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.540]   It's like a serial.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.540]   Now, that's your chat head, right?
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.540]   Yes, my chat head.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.540]   It is me.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.540]   If I tap you, will I chat with you?
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.540]   No.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.540]   What should I do?
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.540]   Should I tell it?
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.540]   My message is extremely private.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.780]   You can move over to Messenger.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.260]   You slide it to what you want to do?
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.260]   Okay.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.260]   It stays on there.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.700]   Is it just a launcher replacement?
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.180]   It's a launcher replacement.
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.860]   I like it because you're able to ... I'm using it for you, sorry.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.340]   No, because I don't know how to use it.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.740]   You're able to swipe through.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.980]   I have been clicking ... He hasn't entered from his log screen, but he's now seeing all
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   this Facebook stuff.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.060]   Let me give an example of one picture.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.620]   This is ridiculous, but I don't know who this is.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.260]   I can press it, and then it can show the whole picture.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.260]   Holy crap.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.940]   I've never seen anything like that.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.940]   It's amazing.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.940]   Wow.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.940]   It's amazing.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.940]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.060]   Do you know that the reviews on the Play Store are so bad?
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.660]   48% of the reviews are one star.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.660]   You know why?
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.660]   No.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.660]   Facebook hates us.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.660]   No, it's not that.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.300]   It's only available on four phones, and people are hating it if they can't get it.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.300]   That's what it is.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.740]   I guarantee you.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.900]   I guarantee you that's what it is.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.620]   If everybody had it, they would love it.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.620]   This thing is amazing.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.620]   Look, Chris Wheeler right here.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.620]   You're going to stick with it?
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.620]   I'm going to go ahead and ...
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.620]   You can like it without ...
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.620]   I can like it.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.780]   I can go ahead and go right in the comments.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.220]   The whole point is Facebook's front and center.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.460]   What's interesting is search is kind of two clicks down.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.260]   Normally on a Google phone, the search is right on the top.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.260]   It's gone.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.260]   I hold this here.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.260]   You've got to hold it.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.460]   I click Google, and then I can ...
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.460]   That's how you get to it.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.460]   Wow.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.460]   Okay.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.460]   Then my apps, they are just ...
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.460]   How do you get to your apps?
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.460]   You slide up.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.540]   I'm still trying to find the appeal of having this installed.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.860]   I don't see it.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.140]   If you're fully invested in Facebook and just like to know what everybody's doing ...
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.140]   I'm peripherally invested.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.220]   I'll tell you what it's good for.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.340]   I liked a whole bunch of pages like The Verge, Twit, Mashable.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.580]   Now it's an information stream.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.020]   Now it's like a flip board to me.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.020]   I get to see the news.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.020]   I break in news.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.540]   I subscribe purposely to all of those.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.580]   What Zuckerberg said is that it's people-centric, not app-centric.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.260]   I think that that's kind of true.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.340]   The way you get it, by the way, it's very interesting.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.300]   You actually start in your Facebook app.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:02.060]   If you've got the Facebook app on there and you have a phone that supports it, there's
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.060]   a button in the Facebook app that says, "Install Facebook Home."
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:11.100]   By doing that, interesting, if you go to the Facebook Home app on the Play Store, it says,
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.700]   "This app requires no permissions.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.260]   Doesn't need to know anything about you."
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.260]   It lays right over Android.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.260]   It doesn't have to.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:22.420]   Because it's living under Facebook, the app, which has all the permissions to see everything.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.420]   You know what?
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   It puts Samsung to shame.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.420]   No special permissions.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.020]   It's overlay, all the stuff they embed in there, all these extra apps that you don't really
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.500]   need as crap where the Samsung puts on.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.500]   It's hidden away.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.700]   Yeah, it puts it to shame.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.980]   You don't need to embed into your Android.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.140]   You could just lay right over it.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.580]   This might be something for Twitter to start doing.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.420]   That's what Google Plus needs to do it.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.300]   Google's got to look at this and say, "Shit, why didn't we think of that?
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.300]   This is Android."
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   This is Google.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.020]   Yes, if they knew a phone, it might be some use to it.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.020]   Apparently.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.060]   Maybe they'll put it in the Google Glass.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.900]   We're supposed to get our glasses in the next few weeks.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.260]   I've been given the privilege of paying $1,500.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.580]   I just don't have it.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.580]   Did you buy one?
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.580]   You bought it?
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.580]   Well, Google I/O last year.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.580]   Go ahead, bring me my ... This is what I got for $1,500.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.100]   I was going to say, I thought you had them here.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.140]   You got a box.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.140]   You have the Google Glasses?
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.140]   No, I don't have them here.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.900]   I got ... You got a promissory note?
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.100]   I got a paperweight.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.820]   You have a paperweight for $1,500.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.820]   Wow.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.820]   Oh, it's glass.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.660]   I want to see it here.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.260]   It's glass and it's got my number on it.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.260]   Oh, nice.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.980]   It's kind of like a Bitcoin, except it's a lot more tangible.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.340]   It's got my number on it.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.340]   That's very valuable.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.340]   Wait a minute.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.340]   Isn't that an airline?
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.340]   737 is my number.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.020]   I will be number 737 in line to get Google Glass.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.980]   They said that the next few weeks we'll get them.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.940]   I'll wear them on the show and we'll give you our review.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:47.260]   So far, the only person who's worn them is Gavin Newsom, the Secretary of State of California
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.100]   and Joshua Tupulsky, the editor-in-chief of Gasham.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.380]   Are they wearing them now?
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.380]   No.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.020]   I'm going to wear them around a little bit.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.020]   And then there's Googlers.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.020]   There's lots of Googlers.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.460]   You can go, like there's pop-up stores where you can wear them.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.460]   I've been waiting.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.340]   Look at all the audience members.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.900]   I've been waiting for somebody in the audience to wear Google.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.900]   Nobody has Google Glass.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.820]   It could be cleverly hidden though.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:07.820]   Like on your face?
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.820]   He's got it.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.820]   He's got it.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.820]   That's it.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.820]   I can tell.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.340]   I'm just waiting for somebody to do it.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   Are you excited about it?
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.340]   Are you still kind of...
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.340]   I hate it.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.340]   This is going to be like this.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:22.420]   The big plague that's happened to public people who do speeches and the like, especially...
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.580]   It's a teleprompter you wear on your head.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.020]   That would be cool.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.780]   But generally, that would actually not be a bad thing.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.460]   I don't think you need a teleprompter to give a speech.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.820]   But what's happened is in the audience, the audience of a tech audience has turned into
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.820]   all on their laptops.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:40.820]   Nobody's looking up.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:45.860]   You could be stripping up there and no one would notice until somebody screamed.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:50.860]   That's why Sergey Brin said at TED that looking at your smartphone is emasculating.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.860]   Well I don't know if it's emasculating.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.860]   I don't know what he's talking about.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.260]   But now they're all going to be looking as though they're looking at you, but they're
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.300]   going to be talking to their little Google Glasses and running...
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.980]   Don't people already do that with the Bluetooth?
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.300]   You think they're talking to you and they turn around, isn't that...
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.300]   Well, no, I know.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.300]   But I'm talking about the big audience.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.300]   On a presentation, yeah.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.300]   That would be weird.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.940]   It would look like they're kind of... but I swear you'd probably strip up there too.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.420]   So I'm also waiting for my Oculus Rift, which I also backed on Kickstarter.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:27.820]   Everyone I've known that's used it has complained about dizziness, lack of...
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.820]   Nausea.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.820]   Nausea.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.820]   What?
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.820]   The Oculus Rift.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.420]   They say that may happen even with the Google Glass that it's a risky thing to... you know,
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.220]   your eyes... it's a risky thing to mess with them.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.220]   Well, it's your eyes and your inner ear.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.180]   Because you're looking to the side, which is weird.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.460]   Also the 3D effect of those stereoscopic glasses that used to have the shutters, they discovered
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.860]   that kids under the age of 12, I believe, would actually damage their optic nerve.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.860]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.740]   Because they were still developing their brains.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.060]   Google's implant emplacement eventually will replace those.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:59.060]   Well, we're going to have a whole generation of kids who are deaf from listening to iPod
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.060]   headphones too loud.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.060]   And blind from playing.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.660]   They're blind from wearing Oculus Rift.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.660]   It's going to be great.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.380]   But the good news is they have no privacy.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.700]   But it would be quite funny to watch them bumping into each other.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.460]   At least they won't be driving on the road anymore.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.020]   Well, if you know, they don't have to go out there in the living room.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.460]   They can just mine Bitcoins on their PCs.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.180]   I do want to mention, I do want to say, I mean, this CISPA thing.
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:22.180]   I do feel like that there was some point, imperceptible point, where we turned a corner.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:26.700]   Where, you know, we used to be, this used to be the land of the free, right?
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.820]   Freedom was a basic philosophical tenet of the United States.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.700]   Do you think that that's still the case, John?
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:35.740]   Do you think that maybe we have started to think freedom's overrated?
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.940]   We could give up a little freedom because it's more important to be safe.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   Well, that's what I was asking for.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.980]   That's what's been going on for, I mean, yeah.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.980]   That point changed.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.260]   Yeah, when the internet came along.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.260]   The internet did that?
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.260]   I believe so, yes.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.860]   We'd be much better off without it.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.740]   I've been advocating shutting it down for years without it paying any attention.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.260]   What would you be doing for a living, sir?
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.660]   I didn't need the internet before.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.660]   I was a writer.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.660]   I'm a writer.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.660]   I use a computer and I write on a computer.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.660]   I don't write on a laptop.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.660]   I don't write on a tablet.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.660]   I don't write on a phone.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.940]   Okay, but understand, the internet is not going away, right?
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.020]   I mean, you can admit that.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.220]   I have, yeah, unfortunately, I think you're right.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.220]   It's here.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.860]   Although I think, I still believe that we're not the end of the road and it will be, I
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.340]   honestly believe it will be segmented at some point where every country will have its own
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.340]   closed net because a lot of these countries can't put up with all the stuff that comes
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.340]   in.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.940]   So I think that Saudi Arabia is going to have a closed internet.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.940]   You're right.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.940]   We're going to have a closed internet.
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.420]   There's going to be some people that have the privilege to cross nets, you know, that
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.940]   have special licenses or whatever.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.940]   A passport?
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:40.380]   A similar, but it would be an electronic passport that allows me to go to the Saudi Arabia net
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:46.260]   if I get a visa from Saudi Arabia and I can go on their net because there's no other way
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:52.900]   of stopping what's going on, which is a complete, you know, this is kind of porn crossing lines,
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.180]   spies, cyber attacks.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.980]   All these things can be stopped really easily by just segmenting the net.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.940]   The problem is it's, you know, it's an argument that's been going on forever and people raise
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:08.020]   it every time there's been a disruptive, not just technology, but kind of social phenomenon.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.340]   I mean, globalization, that was the big one.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.420]   Now all our markets are tied in together.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:17.460]   We're competing with people who would gladly make a twelfth of what we make and do the
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.500]   same amount of work.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.860]   And so, you know, outsourcing was kind of the big one.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.420]   Every time something comes along and, you know, freedom as the foundation of the country
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.900]   is a national myth.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   It's, you know.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.860]   You don't believe it ever existed.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:36.180]   It was one of those things that maybe at one time was a really grand notion, but, you know,
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.180]   when the colonies formed together and at the time it was, it wasn't, there was, there was
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:45.140]   a big push for, for not having a federalized country because all these states wanted to
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.140]   be independent.
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.140]   Right.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.140]   I mean, they are independent.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.980]   It's a federal system.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.820]   Except that federal laws precede.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.820]   No, they don't.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.820]   For murder?
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:55.820]   The 10th amendment.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:01.540]   What, what, tell me what, what, what national law, we don't have murder laws in California?
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.260]   Yeah, we do.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.260]   Well then why, why would there be a federal one?
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.620]   How about pot?
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.620]   That's a good one.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.620]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.620]   This is the problem.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.620]   Okay.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   Let's back it up.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.620]   How about the Volstead Act?
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.620]   Why did they have to pass a constitutional amendment?
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   Is that the one where you get underage girls across state lines?
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.620]   I wish.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.620]   Okay.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:22.620]   Well, if you're going to make stupid comments, the Volstead Act.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.140]   You're talking prohibition.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.780]   Why was that a constitutional amendment?
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.780]   Because they could.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.260]   Why don't they just pass a law like they did with the pot law?
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.260]   Right.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:35.980]   No, and the pot law is also unconstitutional.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.380]   But no court has struck it down.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.980]   Colorado, Washington.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.660]   State courts can't strike down federal law.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.740]   Then why does Colorado have legalized pot?
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.660]   We have legalized pot for medical use.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.660]   And the feds are coming down on it.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.380]   And the feds continue to raid pot pharmacies.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.380]   Exactly.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.380]   So, so you just.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:57.020]   So where, why do, okay, well why don't you back up a second?
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.260]   Just back up one second and ask yourself why this is going on?
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.740]   Why is this going on?
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.380]   Because the federal government is trying to take over states' rights.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.380]   We have our own rights.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.780]   We have our own laws in every single state.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.860]   And the federal government would love to have no, why would we have to do a constitutional
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.900]   amendment when you just pass a simple law?
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.900]   Right.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:15.900]   So we need no constitutional amendments.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.060]   It's a lot harder to pass a constitutional amendment.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.060]   It's almost impossible.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.060]   You've got to get all the states to agree.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.060]   75%.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:26.140]   So, let's just drop the constitution, drop the amendments and just pass a bunch of federal
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.220]   laws and turn it into a federal government.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.700]   Screw the states.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.580]   That's what you guys are arguing for.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.580]   No, I'm not.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.580]   Well, he is.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.580]   I don't know what's wrong with him.
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.580]   I didn't argue for that.
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.580]   Did you argue for that?
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.580]   Poor guy.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.580]   Fine.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.580]   Yes, that's what I'm arguing for.
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.580]   Go read the 10th Amendment.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.580]   No, I agree with you.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.580]   I agree with you.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.780]   Although states' rights have often been used as a cover for things like.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.420]   Federal law does not trump state law.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.740]   That's the point we're trying to make here.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.740]   Okay.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:58.260]   Let's talk about the Civil Rights Act, which was a federal law designed to promote equality
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:02.940]   for African Americans and state by state that would not have happened.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:03.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.940]   Right?
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.940]   So, there are some cases where.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.940]   Nobody objected to it.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.940]   Well, a couple of states.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.460]   I think there was this guy named George Wallace with an ax handle, but some people objected
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.060]   to it, but that's the question is, and I think often when you hear this argument about states'
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.180]   rights, it really is about the negros.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.180]   It really is.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.180]   Excuse me.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.180]   It's about the what?
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.180]   What word was that?
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.180]   Yeah, why don't you spell that word?
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.180]   N-I-G-R-A.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.180]   I'm going to shit my pants.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.180]   No, I'm just saying, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:32.300]   No, I'm just saying that really often states' rights is used as code for racism.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   Is it not?
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.300]   But the.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.940]   When we're talking to states' rights, we're talking to marijuana laws, we're talking all
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:37.940]   kinds of things.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.420]   Yeah, but you can't, it needs to.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.620]   Yeah, it was in the 50s.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.540]   Well, I think still is.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.540]   I mean.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.540]   Somewhat.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.540]   No, amongst Democrats maybe.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.140]   I mean, as at war as those laws are, it still brings up a good point.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.300]   You can't just pick and choose, yeah, that one's fine, that one's not fine.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.300]   Yeah, which one do you want?
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.500]   Do you want the Civil Rights Act or do you want the.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.500]   It's not a buffet.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   It's a buffet.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.500]   He's a.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.500]   That's the problem with him.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.500]   He's a buffet liberal.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.500]   No, conservative.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.500]   I can't figure out what that one is.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.500]   I'm neither one.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.500]   I'm a libertarian.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.500]   He's a libertarian.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.500]   Anyway.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.500]   I don't think the chat room was too happy with you about that one.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   Oh, I don't care.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.500]   I like it.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.500]   I like it.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.500]   I'm trying to figure out his definitions.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.500]   Go ahead, hit me.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.180]   I'm breaking bad.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.180]   Bring me the hat.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.900]   I want the pork pie hat.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.140]   It's OK to say blacks are African Americans.
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.140]   I think so.
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.140]   OK.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.140]   Negroes is not so.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.140]   That's not a good word.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.140]   I was playing on the fact that.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.140]   Never mind.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.140]   Forget it.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.140]   I'm not saying that.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.740]   I mean, I know it doesn't mean it's still cool to hear.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.740]   OK.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   I didn't say that.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.740]   I like that little tag you got on.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.740]   What's that?
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.740]   He's got a name tag that says YouTube.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.740]   So he was given that as an elevator.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.740]   I believe that the Civil Rights Act.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.740]   I apologize if that was offensive.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.740]   I do apologize.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:42.740]   I wasn't offended, but it just sounded.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:49.740]   It was using the phrase that people often use and they say, you know, that's the point.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.740]   I was mocking that.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:51.740]   So I do apologize.
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:52.740]   That wasn't intended to offend.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.740]   You're just embarrassing him now.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   No, I don't get embarrassed.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.420]   I don't get a civil rights act.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.580]   I'm embarrassed with the YouTube videos.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.220]   He had pigs feet the other day.
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.220]   Oh, pigs.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.220]   He's delicious.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.260]   Can I rest my case?
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.260]   What?
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.380]   No pickles, pickled pigs feet in a jar was the worst.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.380]   Oh, you had a crappy one then.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.380]   No, no, no, no.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.700]   Seriously, no good pickles.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.700]   You guys are both wrong.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.700]   No seriously, good pickles.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.700]   Pigs feet are fantastic.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.700]   Really?
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.700]   What do they taste like?
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.700]   They don't have.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.580]   It's not the flavor so much as the texture.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.660]   The texture is dope.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.660]   That was a problem.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.780]   Well, with you maybe.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.260]   But seriously, I like the cartilage.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.020]   If you like cartilage at all, it's good for your nails.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:41.260]   So anyway, I believe that was past just to reiterate what the Constitution provided.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.580]   Which was the Volstead Act?
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.220]   No, the Civil Rights Act.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.220]   The Civil Rights Act.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.220]   They're saying, look, here's what it was.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.220]   You're right.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.220]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.220]   It wasn't some crazy thing.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.220]   But it was still a federal law.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:54.340]   But it was, it was, but it was not an unconstitutional law.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:55.620]   But it supersedes the state's laws.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.540]   No, it was not an unconstitutional law.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.540]   Right.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.540]   It had nothing to do with the state laws.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.540]   It was backed by the Constitution.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.540]   No, I think you're right.
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.540]   I think you're right.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.700]   But what about pot?
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.580]   What about pot?
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.780]   Federal government has no right to say, to make pot illegal.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.740]   If they think it should be illegal since it's not proscribed within the constitutional
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.780]   requirements, they should pass an amendment the way the Volstead Act did.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.380]   Aren't most of the anti-drug laws federal laws?
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.100]   Yeah, and they're all illegal.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:26.100]   So why has no challenge in the constitutional challenge?
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.420]   It's kind of like, it's one of those things where who's going to, we're starting now because
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.460]   it's been, it's been kind of demonized for so many years.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.460]   Oh, drug use.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.100]   Oh, what do you want everyone to be a heroin addict?
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.460]   I mean, if you take a look at what happened in Portugal, which is the place nobody wants
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.420]   to talk about where all drugs were decriminalized, all the drug uses fell through the floor.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.820]   And it's like nobody uses drugs there anymore.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.900]   I mean, nobody wants to mention it.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.900]   Drug use is, I don't think drug use is weighing it.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.900]   It's just that the associated crime with people's traditional.
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.860]   You don't have to break into cars to get money to buy heroin.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.620]   That and also the crime syndicates get blowed up.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.220]   The whole thing changes.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.380]   But no, no, no, we have, it's almost like we have an institutionalized industry.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.020]   All those crime organizations shift to something else.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.980]   I mean, like when, when prohibition got ended, they didn't, the mob suddenly didn't disappear.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.620]   No, it just moved into another.
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.620]   No, that's a good point.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:17.620]   Prostitution, gambling.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.620]   Well, there you have it.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:25.420]   And that's your, uh, extortion teenage moving girls across state lines.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.900]   That's a lot of money.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.620]   It's a lot of money in it.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.540]   I want to do an ad right now, but the other thing I don't want to do right now.
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.340]   No, we're on a constitutional debate.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.380]   Here's iPad four, eight, five, nine says I'm a certifiable cook.
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.340]   It does what this guy says in the chat room.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.100]   I think it's chat room number two, by the way.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.980]   I'm a certifiable cook.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:48.980]   You are?
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.700]   The evidence is right here and Leo has totally embarrassed it.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.700]   Oh, you were also embarrassed.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.700]   I'm the certified cook.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.500]   No, no, I'm the certifiable cook.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.580]   Apparently some guy embarrasses himself.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:07.860]   So this guy, I guess number iPad guy is the genius in the whole, he can explain himself
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.860]   later.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:09.860]   I love it.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.900]   Anyway, we're going to take a break.
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.820]   I can't figure out what's going on.
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.820]   I'm not even drunk.
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:14.820]   There's really crazy.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.820]   John is a little, a little correct.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.100]   One guy.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.100]   It's the shirt.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.100]   Whenever you wear this shirt.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.100]   I know, I love this shirt.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.780]   This show just something bad happens.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.780]   This is good.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.780]   This is good.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.780]   Broadcasting material.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.780]   This is good.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.780]   This is.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:33.780]   Did you know it would be anything like this when you came along?
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.780]   No, no.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.860]   Would you, would you like to leave now or do you want to save it for later?
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.860]   I'm, I'm, I'm strong.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.860]   You can storm out.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:40.860]   No, I'm not going to storm out.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:41.860]   You're powerful.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.900]   I still need a ride from someone here.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.900]   I'll stay right here.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.380]   There's nothing that keeps people in their seats and needing a ride.
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.820]   The vorac wants to live in 1941.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.020]   This chat room number one.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.540]   You weren't even, wait, maybe you were alive.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.540]   No, no, I wasn't.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.540]   Okay.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.500]   Actually, there is a direct correlation to the Volstead act and the, and the drug, anti-drug
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.500]   laws in the US.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.500]   There's no correlation.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.500]   Nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.500]   Nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.500]   Cause nobody wants to get high.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.620]   I mean, nobody wants to say I, I support getting high.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:14.220]   I support marijuana laws and I don't care to get high.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.260]   I was a kid, right?
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.860]   No, I can't do it anymore.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.860]   It's really the problem.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:20.860]   I've been a good boy.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:21.860]   I can't clean up my office.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:22.860]   I've said it before.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:29.460]   Guy in the chat room says I, uh, I have a felony, uh, on my record due to American medical marijuana
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.460]   conviction.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.460]   San Jose.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.820]   And now he's not even given the right to vote anymore.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.900]   The city he was in San Jose, no problem.
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:39.180]   But the property was prosecuted by the County of Santa Clara.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.180]   I'm telling you, this is out of control.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.700]   It is confusing if you have a license, it's legal.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.700]   You're told yes, fine.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.460]   San Jose says, go ahead, you know, open your pharmacy.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.540]   And then the County says, uh, uh, uh, or the fed saying, uh, uh, uh, it's very confusing.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.020]   We have overlapping contradictory laws.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:49:00.340]   We need some, some police departments that take up arms.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:04.640]   But getting back to where this all started, which is, I feel that we have turned a corner
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.140]   in this country, but you're saying we never freedom was this country was never really
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.140]   free.
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:13.540]   No offense, but slavery was disenfranchised a big chunk of the population.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.860]   I just was watching Lincoln though.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.580]   And there was that great fight to end slavery.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.660]   Of course that was a movie.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.340]   Who knows what it was really like.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.100]   As Daniel Day-Lewis was a wonderful link.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.100]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.100]   All right.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.100]   Thank you.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.100]   Cause I'm running the show now.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.100]   Thank you.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.100]   Would you please?
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.380]   Cause I just, I wish I had nothing to do with it.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.300]   We have a lot of international viewers and I'm curious what they think.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.300]   Oh, I know what they think.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.180]   The American's are crazy gun crazy maniacs.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.900]   We are, but it's fun that way.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:44.900]   Well that's another question.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:45.900]   Well, no, I better not.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.100]   I better not our show.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.100]   You know, is it time to get a new phone?
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.100]   I think it is.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.700]   I'm going to get a new one soon.
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:52.700]   Are you?
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.700]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.700]   You've already done with the note.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.700]   Well, I'm looking forward to the S four.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.700]   I'm getting my one.
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   I'm getting my one.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.380]   I can't wait to get the HTC one.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.460]   So what do you see people are leaving now?
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.260]   Well, it's nice to meet you.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:06.260]   Thank you.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:07.260]   Take care.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.260]   See, we're scaring people away now.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.260]   Or John.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.260]   John's gone too.
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.260]   Lamar, your rides here.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.260]   No, it's not.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.260]   Please don't leave.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.260]   Now John will be back.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.260]   What John does during our commercials, he wanders around looking for free stuff.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:21.260]   Oh, I thought he had to use the bathroom or something.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.260]   No, no, no, no.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.260]   He just likes to see if he could find any free booze or anything like that.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.260]   Go ahead.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.260]   You can do the same.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.260]   That's fine.
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.260]   Everybody's leaving.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.260]   Not everyone.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.260]   I haven't ever had this happen before.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.260]   You still have a majority of people that were in here when I sat down.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:35.260]   All right.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   All right.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.260]   So we're going to talk about the show today.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:43.260]   The show today brought to you by Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:47.260]   I really am ready for a new phone, the Galaxy S4.
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.260]   The HTC One is coming on Wednesday.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:54.260]   But the problem is I have a drawer full of the old phones, my Galaxy S3, my Galaxy Note.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.260]   I have a couple of those.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.260]   I'm going to have to price this one.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.260]   Blackberries.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.260]   Well, all right.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.260]   Let's do it right now.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.260]   Tell me a little bit about AT&T.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.260]   This is Verizon.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.260]   Verizon.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.260]   Let's click the Verizon button.
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.260]   We're at Gazelle.com.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.260]   You got 30 days.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.260]   I do like that.
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.260]   But you're locking in the price, right?
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.260]   So when you look at the Galaxy S4, you say, "I don't want it."
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.260]   No problem.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.260]   But if you say, "I want it," I can guarantee you this price is not going up.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.260]   And they will send you the box, too, in most cases.
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:17.260]   They pay the shipping.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.260]   So your Galaxy Note 2.
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.260]   Let me just find that on here from Verizon.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:21.260]   All right.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.260]   Let's get it on.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.260]   It's in what kind of condition?
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.260]   Flawless?
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.260]   Great.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.260]   Flawless.
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.260]   Does it look like it's never been used?
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.260]   Well, except for the fingerprints, yes.
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.260]   Well, you can wipe those off.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.260]   All right.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.260]   No water damage, right?
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   Nope.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.260]   No water damage.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.260]   That's pretty good.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.260]   That's actually going to pay for your Galaxy S4 right there, 226 bucks.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.260]   Sure.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.260]   So what you do is you get the box.
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:44.260]   They pay the shipping on anything worth more than a buck, but then go back and do more.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.260]   John, you found a box of red vines.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.260]   Are you happy about that?
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:52.260]   We'll talk about red vines versus Twizzlers after this commercial.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.260]   Oh, that?
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.260]   That.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.260]   Now, you thought this was vicious.
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:59.260]   The rest of the audience is going to leave now because this is going to be very, very
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.260]   vicious.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:08.020]   So your iPhone, BlackBerry, Samsung phones, iPads, iPods, Macbooks, Macs, it's just a
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.020]   great way.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.020]   This is, you know, April is the month of recycling.
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.900]   This is effectively recycling.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.740]   Somebody's going to buy this phone that wants it.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.060]   You're going to get cash back.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:21.100]   Best part of all from Gazelle, besides the 30 days, which I love, 30 day lock, is you'll
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:26.260]   get paid fast by check PayPal, or if you want an Amazon gift card, you get an extra 5%.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.540]   Now, a lot of us buy stuff on Amazon all the time.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.540]   I've bought it a couple of times.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.540]   Oh, you have?
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.540]   I'm a big fan of them.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.460]   The people like you and me who want new gadgets all the time, this is a great solution.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.260]   Even if not, maybe you're just ready to move on.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.260]   Risk-free.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.540]   Gazelle wipes your data for free.
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.540]   They've paid $100 million to over half a million customers over the last few years.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.540]   Look at that.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.340]   $225 for that old iPad.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.380]   That's nice.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.420]   Free shipping, fast processing.
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.420]   That's version three.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.420]   It's about a year old.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.420]   It only lasts about seven months.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:57.420]   I know.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.420]   Before they came out.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.420]   I know.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:04.780]   Remember it, gazelle.com, when it's time to trade in the old and go for the new.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.820]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.700]   Those are red vines.
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:11.700]   You prefer Twizzlers?
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.700]   These are by the way.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:13.700]   No, God, no.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:14.700]   Nobody in their right mind prefers Twizzlers.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.700]   Okay, good.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:16.700]   I was worried.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.700]   No, geez.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.700]   They're just-
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:19.700]   We don't know.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.700]   You may not-
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.700]   A Twizzler is like you bite into it and it just falls apart.
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.700]   These things are chewy.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.620]   There's some sort of elasticity to it.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.620]   You know, there's no actual-
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.580]   These actually get better when they get older.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.580]   There's no licorice in here?
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.580]   Licorice in there.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:32.580]   Even the black ones, I don't know if they have any licorice in them.
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.580]   I don't think so.
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.580]   No.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:37.220]   The only thing I think that's ever been close to licorice has been Uzo.
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.300]   Uzo is not a good thing to drink.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.300]   No.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.900]   Great for starting your car though on a cold day.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.380]   Just squirt some Uzo on the carburetor like that.
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.580]   I have a fuel injected car.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.340]   You don't need it.
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.060]   Microsoft has moved its-
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.540]   That argument ended pretty quickly.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.540]   Decisive.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:56.540]   Decisively.
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.460]   I thought that's because nobody would defend Twizzlers.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.900]   Nobody in the West Coast.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.460]   The Twizzlers and East Coast thing.
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.220]   Anybody in the audience eat Twizzlers and perform the red vine?
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.220]   There you go.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.220]   Chad.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.220]   He's from Texas.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.220]   Oh, we got another guy.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.220]   He's from the East Coast.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.220]   That's Jeff.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.220]   Jeffrey Needles.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.220]   Red vines taste like wax.
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.220]   Tastes like what?
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.220]   Wax.
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.220]   That's because they're made of wax.
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.220]   Well-
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:19.220]   Is that the main ingredient?
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.220]   No, no.
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.220]   Number one ingredient, corn syrup.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.780]   Yes, see, I can't eat this stuff.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.780]   Number two ingredient, wheat flour.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:25.780]   It's not high fructose corn syrup.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:26.780]   It's real corn syrup.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.540]   It's citric acid, artificial flavor and color, red dine-in.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   Not that much better.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.540]   It's made with wheat.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.740]   It's basically wheat and corn syrup.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.540]   But I got to tell you something.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.060]   You got 5.5.
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.060]   That's not annoying.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:47.020]   The American Candy Company sends us this all the time.
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.020]   Why?
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.300]   Because they know how much we love red vines and hate Twizzlers.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.300]   Now maybe the Twizzlers-
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.100]   Leo runs a side business running a theater.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.540]   Well, you're going to pass them on amongst the audience, just give the thing out there.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.540]   I think everyone in the audience should have one.
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:04.900]   Actually, Lisa buys these giant things at Costco for the staff.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.440]   It's a little bonus.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.440]   That's a bonus?
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.440]   That's better than Bitcoin.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.440]   What kind of a bonus?
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.500]   And yeah, a bonus.
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.500]   It's a bonus.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.340]   Oh, Twitter, music.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.460]   Let's talk about that.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:23.060]   Twitter is about to launch, we think, in the next couple of days.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.700]   A music site.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:30.020]   They're going to call it #music.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.020]   And I think-
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.020]   You know, this is the irony of this.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.380]   Wasn't Twitter the big op?
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.380]   Oh, hashtags.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.380]   We don't like, we don't like, we don't want them.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.380]   They didn't like hashtags.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.620]   Prisma's seen that and imposed them on Twitter.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.120]   And then eventually they said, "Oh, all right.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   You know what?
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.220]   We're going to do hashtags."
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.220]   And-
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:47.100]   Because they've learned they need to earn some cash.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.700]   Now they realize this is how they can make money.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.700]   Oh, I love that.
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:55.220]   I love that the Twitter music only allow for 140 lyrics and then the song gets cut off.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.780]   140 notes.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:58.780]   That's it.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:59.780]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:00.780]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.780]   I actually cannot-
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.780]   What is their motivation?
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:06.820]   Somebody in the chat room pointed out an interesting phenomenon, which I've noticed too, is that
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:11.060]   you go to Costco, you mentioned it, you always spend the exact same amount of money no matter
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.060]   what you try-
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.060]   It's always 500 bucks.
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.060]   Oh, it's five for you?
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.060]   It's 250 for me.
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.060]   It's 300 for that guy in the chat room.
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.060]   So you go to Costco.
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.060]   Every time you go to Costco you spend 500 bucks.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.060]   Go to Costco?
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.060]   Costco anybody?
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.580]   I don't understand Sam's Club only.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.580]   Well, same thing.
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.660]   I spend 600 bucks on tires, but that's because I don't buy.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.660]   200, 250.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:32.940]   I typically spend about $80 because I don't go in there with the- I used to spend like
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:37.060]   200 bucks buying a giant case of peanut butter that I wouldn't use for like two years.
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.060]   Right.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.060]   And they would go bad.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.420]   And it's like, "What am I going to do?"
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.580]   I like it when you get to the bottom of that 80 pound bag of tortilla chips.
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:48.420]   Oh, I used to buy those because I had roommates and they'd literally finish it off in like
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   two weeks.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.100]   Oh, that's breakfast, lunch and dinner if you want.
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.100]   It is.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.180]   I don't have enough room in my new place to store all this stuff.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:59.020]   I used to have a big freezer where I can store all that stuff for months.
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.020]   Move out of Chicago.
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:01.020]   Do yourself a favor.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:02.020]   Well, I'm already out of Chicago.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.020]   I'm in LA.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.020]   Even better.
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.020]   Bigger place.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.940]   No, I have a smaller apartment.
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:07.940]   Don't buy food.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:08.940]   That's what I've learned.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.660]   If you buy food, just buy like their thing of apple, like fresh food.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.660]   Okay.
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:13.660]   I'm sorry I brought this up.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.660]   I started up.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.660]   I apologize to the chat room.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.660]   I'm supposed to keep going.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   I'm moving on.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.660]   I'm moving on.
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:21.660]   That's fine.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.660]   So Leo, Twitter Music.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.660]   So did you hear that Twitter's going to do ...
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:28.540]   Talking about Red Vines.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.620]   And so is that of any interest to anybody that they're going to ...
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:33.620]   Apparently not.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.620]   I thought this was like a big deal.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:39.460]   You know, when Google did music, when ... I mean, everybody's going against iTunes trying
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.020]   to beat them and no.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:45.060]   I don't see the motivation with all the sites that are already ... I agree.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:53.660]   If you go to music.twitter.com, there's a #music hashtag and a sign in button.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:54.740]   Trending music.
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:59.300]   And apparently Twitter, there have been a lot of reports, wants to launch a music service.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.700]   So do you play like right from your main feed?
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:06.140]   I think the idea, and I think it's actually a good idea, is to somehow tie people's tweets
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.300]   into a music service.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.820]   So people you follow, they'll say, "Oh, I like this song.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.820]   I like this song."
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.540]   You know, Google+, which nobody uses, unfortunately, does this.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.920]   You can actually give people a free song.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.420]   If you say, "I like this song on Google Music," it'll give them a full play.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.740]   You're going to get so much heat for saying no one uses it.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.660]   I know, but I've been telling you, nobody does.
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:25.660]   And there's some great stuff in there.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:26.660]   Twitter.music.com?
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.660]   Music.twitter.com.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:28.660]   Right here.
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:29.740]   This is what you get.
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:30.740]   You get a sign in.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.660]   Now, yeah, if they had to where ... I mean, if Amazon, Link, or iTunes popped up when someone
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:38.500]   mentioned a song, I wouldn't be opposed to that.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.660]   But then I can see why they're doing their own apps.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.340]   They don't want anybody else doing apps because they wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.580]   And this is how they monetize.
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.580]   Right.
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.380]   CNET's reporting that ... When is this thing going to end?
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.380]   What's that?
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   Twitter.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.740]   Oh, it's over at Jump to Shark years ago.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:54.740]   But not.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:55.740]   But not.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:59:00.300]   Too many people have invested their social capital into it.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.460]   So Twitter acquired a company called We Are Hunted.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.300]   Terrible name, but it's a music recommendation.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:07.580]   We Are Hunted?
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   We Are Hunted.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.580]   Why would I care what someone's listening to?
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.340]   Do you have your Spotify connected to your Facebook?
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.340]   Nope.
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.340]   Okay.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:16.340]   I don't either for that reason.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:19.340]   I do not link any of my social networks to each other except for Twitter.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.340]   Good for you.
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.340]   I hate that.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.340]   You're reading Twitter and you got a bunch of four-square messages.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.340]   This is like, "Oh, do you want to sign in with Facebook?"
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:26.340]   No.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.340]   I don't want to sign ... I'll create a new login.
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:28.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.420]   The last thing I need to do is ... I got into Spotify right before they closed the door.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:31.420]   I made it Facebook only.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:34.060]   Don't you think it's amazing though that Twitter, which really is a very simple thing, it's a
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:37.180]   text messaging service really, right?
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:41.940]   The Facebook, 140-character text messaging service, has managed to find so many interesting
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:42.940]   ways to use this.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:43.940]   They're not making money though.
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:44.940]   They need to make ... Yeah.
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:45.940]   Well, I think they're making money.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.940]   Are they?
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.940]   You have a lot of employees.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.940]   Authorize Twitter Music Web to use your account.
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:50.940]   Would it be interesting if they partnered with Amazon?
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:54.500]   I think that would be a good ... Or they're already in bed with Apple, so iTunes links
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.500]   would make more sense, wouldn't it?
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:57.500]   I don't know.
[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:58.500]   We just don't know.
[00:59:58.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   We don't know what they're going to do.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.180]   I tend to actually follow bands I listen to, and that's my Twitter music.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.180]   Really?
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.180]   Okay.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.180]   I agree.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.180]   I don't really care what you're listening to if I'm tweeting with you.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.180]   I have absolutely no interest in John's musical taste.
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.180]   What kind of song is this guy?
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.180]   I think a lot of ... I think basically classical.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:12.180]   I could see where you'd be coming from there.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.180]   Okay.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.020]   But I'll tell you why.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:19.180]   Because there's people like me who don't know what the young people like you are listening
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.180]   to.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.180]   Oh, the young folks.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.180]   Young people.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.180]   Hey, that's all good.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.180]   This guy's 50.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.180]   Oh, he's not.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.180]   What does that say about you?
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.180]   I'm a bit older.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.180]   I want to know.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.180]   I want to know.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:34.620]   Well, so I got a hip friend like Roger Chang here.
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.140]   What's Roger listening to?
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.500]   Don't you do that sometimes when you see somebody who's kind of into music and say, "What are
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.500]   you listening to?"
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500]   No.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   Don't you want to discover new music?
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.500]   I'm with Roger on this one.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   You guys are frozen.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.500]   You guys are all frozen in cement.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.500]   You don't listen to new music.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.500]   No.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.820]   I listen to new music, but I generally find ...
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.100]   How do you find new music?
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.100]   It's weird.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:57.820]   I go through a weird process of either listening through Pandora, and usually there's always
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.980]   ... There are little algorithms.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.740]   So you go, "I hear your song I like."
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.740]   And then I create a new stage room with that.
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.740]   Or to Spotify Radio.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.740]   That's true.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.740]   Until I find something.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.740]   You don't want to use Pandora.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.820]   Modern technology instead of ... Radio paradise.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.980]   Asking someone, "What kind of music you listening to?"
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.340]   Because I could be like you.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.340]   Let me ask you a question.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.340]   Maybe I can catch up.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.380]   Honestly, I don't value the opinion of young people all that much.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.700]   Well, Roger's just arrogant about it, so he doesn't care.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.420]   I think the real answer is you guys are frozen in time.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.420]   No.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.420]   I don't care about one direction.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.420]   I'm very eclectic.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.420]   Or Carly Rae Jepsen.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.780]   None of that matters to me.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.500]   You must have somebody who tells you ...
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.940]   I don't have people telling me anything.
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.940]   It's all on the net.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.940]   Harmonica.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:40.940]   There's an internet out there.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:41.940]   Is that all it takes?
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.940]   That's what they're doing.
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:43.940]   That's what Twitter's doing.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   Right?
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.940]   They're desperate trying to find a way to make money.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:46.940]   What do you all on the net?
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.940]   What do you say?
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:48.940]   I'm randomly ... Okay.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.220]   Pick a song for me, Google, and play it and I'll see if I like it.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.100]   I listen to radio stations.
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.100]   Radio?
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.100]   Around the world.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.100]   Yes.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.100]   Through the web.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:03.380]   I use a ... I have about 25 sling boxes that are stationed everywhere.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.820]   Around the world.
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.820]   What?
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.820]   Are you kidding me?
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.620]   For the No Agenda Show, we have solicited people to give us their sling box codes.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.140]   So you can watch their TV set.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.620]   We can watch TV sets everywhere.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:18.500]   This is how we accumulate information that we report on.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.420]   And many of these places around the world, they have music on these ...
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.340]   You have your own Nielsen things set up?
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.340]   Essentially, kind of, yeah.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.340]   It's kind of weird.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:31.180]   You kind of remind me of the hoarder, except you're hoarding other people's information.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.300]   We're not hoarding anything.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.380]   We are ... You're consuming.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.980]   We bring it in and put it back.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.300]   Oh, let's watch this Dutch radio show.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.300]   Yep.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.980]   We don't watch a radio show, by the way.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.660]   Have you found new music this way?
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.660]   Is this how you find new music?
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.060]   A lot of great stuff coming out of France right now.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.260]   What do you listen to these days?
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.700]   I can't pronounce any of their names.
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.100]   It's all French.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.100]   And what is it?
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.100]   A lot of accordion music?
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.100]   Oh yeah, that's what it is.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.820]   It's only accordion ... Polkas, as a matter of fact.
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.060]   Is it Phoenix?
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.060]   Only Robert Goulet.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.060]   That's it.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.060]   I would ... I know.
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:02.700]   I think it's ... I want to know ...
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.700]   Why?
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.700]   Because I'm trying to make ...
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:06.700]   Are you listening to Daft Punk?
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.140]   Because I'm totally picturing you in a Daft Punk way.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.700]   I cannot picture that under any circumstances.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.540]   I'm actually ... Trance and House is more of the stuff that I would listen to.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.820]   You like Trance and House?
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:18.820]   If you sit so close ...
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:24.100]   I actually ... I found Trance music to be some of the best music to put on a recording,
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.100]   to play to yourself while you're on a long airline trip.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.100]   Long air ...
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.100]   I thought you were saying driving.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.100]   I was like, no.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.100]   No.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.260]   Trance will just ... You'll put it on and then you wake up in Germany.
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.260]   It's unbelievable.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.260]   Yeah, because you're in a Trance.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.620]   Yes, that's why it's called Trance.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.620]   You listen to House music though?
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.620]   Yeah, well ...
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.900]   What's the difference between Trance and House?
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.540]   I have no idea.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.540]   One sounds function ...
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:43.540]   Chad, you're a young person.
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.540]   You're a youngster.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.540]   And your hair is obviously not a natural hair.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.540]   It's his birthday today, so he's getting older.
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.540]   What?
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.540]   You said what?
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:51.540]   What about his hair?
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.540]   I said his hair ... He's obviously hip because his hair is not a natural hair.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.540]   You see how it matches red vines?
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.540]   What?
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.540]   It matches red vines.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.540]   That's not his hair?
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.540]   No, this ... Yeah, this is natural.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:03:59.540]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:01.540]   I've seen it before.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.540]   I've seen it before, but I've never seen it before.
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.540]   I've never seen it before.

[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:32.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:33.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:35.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:42.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.540]   I've never seen it before.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:10:00.180]   So, why did, in fact, according to this article in Business Insider, Summly didn't even build
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.180]   the app.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:06.340]   They hired a company called SOMO, UK's largest independent mobile marketing agency.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.740]   So what did Yahoo get?
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:12.540]   An app nobody used that made no money, that wasn't designed by anybody at the company,
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.460]   and used backbone technology by another company that had nothing to do with it.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.700]   You didn't even want to keep the kid on board for some bigger projects?
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.140]   I mean, that's really what they bought?
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:22.780]   It turns out, according to Business Insider, that what Yahoo, the deal really was with
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:32.040]   SRI, the company that made Summly's technology, and because SRI had equity in Summly, it was
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.260]   just kind of a side effect.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:40.460]   And in fact, some say inside Yahoo that Summly is Yahoo's Siri, that they're going to build
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.460]   something on it, but it's really the technology for SRI.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.180]   The kid got really lucky.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.380]   He's going to continue to go to high school.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.860]   I think Gizmodo was really, really hard on, I mean that article.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.860]   That was harsh.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.860]   It was a horrible article.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.980]   Well, but if he really was that annoying.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.980]   It's the kid though.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:58.980]   I mean, at the time he was like, "Who's like 15 at the time or 14?"
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.980]   That's Gizmodo for you.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:05.460]   Somebody said in the chat, "Now you're going to start complaining about he was introverted."
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.340]   He didn't even like people.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.740]   Why did they hire him?
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:09.740]   Well, anyway.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.980]   He's not even married.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.220]   The whole story was how this young guy- What does that have to do with it?
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.220]   I'm not married.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.220]   17 year old got $30 million.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.220]   All right.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.220]   I don't like his hair.
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.820]   You know we have a Batman here in Petaluma.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.820]   Did you know that?
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:22.860]   The Petaluma Batman?
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.860]   I follow him on Facebook.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.900]   He calls his car the Bat Camry.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:28.900]   He's got a Camry.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.900]   Bat Camry.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.900]   Wait a minute, is that you?
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:35.940]   When the Petaluma Police Department see Petaluma Batman out patrolling, they usually give him
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.300]   the thumbs up and tell him he's doing a good job.
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:39.300]   Is he really patrolling?
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.060]   Like citizens arrest type of thing?
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:46.700]   I have not seen him, but apparently he's been doing this since December.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:51.780]   Friday and Saturday nights he spends a couple of hours.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.780]   He is not married.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.780]   For sure.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780]   Let's hope.
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:12:00.020]   Well, he's part of a long list of people who've been doing this for the past five, six years.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.020]   Have you seen him, Chad?
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.020]   Have you seen him around?
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.020]   I have not seen him around.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:06.300]   I wonder why, Chad, because every time he's around, you're nowhere to be found.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.900]   I've just never been able to catch up with him.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:14.820]   He has about the worst Batman costume I've ever seen.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:15.820]   It's Baggy Batman.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:16.820]   It's so crazy.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:17.820]   It is.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.820]   No.
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:19.820]   Are those at...
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.820]   He's a college kid.
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:25.820]   Wait, are we supposed to know his identity?
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:26.820]   I guess not.
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.820]   They're dark.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:28.820]   I'm sure the police know who he is.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.820]   He rises early.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:30.820]   In the parking garage.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:31.820]   Local hero.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.820]   He has no muscle mass.
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.820]   Chad?
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:38.100]   He's got a good chin, though.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.140]   No, he's got a nice chin.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.140]   He's got a nice chin.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:44.020]   It's actually been a little bit overwhelming, especially in the beginning.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.020]   By the way, that's the parking garage over here.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.020]   Yeah, I know.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.020]   I know.
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.020]   It's like a parking garage.
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.020]   I just parked it.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:52.020]   I was wondering why all those Channel 7 news vans were there.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.460]   Trying to spread some positivity and spread the message.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:56.620]   If he just had the fake muscles or something.
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.620]   The plastic ones?
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:58.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.620]   Just some definition.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:00.620]   You don't need muscles to be a hero.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620]   You have to look the part.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:06.540]   I want to point out something, crime has plummeted here in Petaluma since this guy has been...
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.540]   We walked down an alley...
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.020]   You mean since the school year started?
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:12.620]   We walked down an alley to go to the Mexican restaurant and I felt safe.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.620]   That's a scary alley, but safe, right?
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.620]   Exactly.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.620]   What alley?
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.620]   Rub a holly out here.
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:18.620]   It's Petaluma.
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:19.620]   That's an alley.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.620]   Dangerous alleys in Petaluma.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:22.620]   You're right.
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:25.620]   You know, running through a cow.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.620]   I'm wondering if there are other...
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.980]   Well, that could be bad.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.100]   Yes, there actually are.
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.100]   There's a lot.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:38.700]   Yeah, the whole genre or group is known as RLSH, real life superheroes, and they are
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.900]   not only in the US, but they're actually around the globe.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:41.900]   What do you know about this?
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:45.220]   I have been following this phenomenon for the better part of 10 years.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.260]   So what is your favorite superhero?
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.180]   So there was a one in Seattle.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.460]   His name was Phoenix and he was recently unmasked.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.460]   I actually heard about that one.
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.460]   But there was also...
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:57.620]   Do they actually stop crime or they just wander around?
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.020]   So you know the Guardian Angels?
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.020]   They essentially do that.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.020]   Eyes on the street.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.020]   Yes.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.700]   Can they citizen arrest or have they?
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.700]   So they actually...
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:09.140]   If you go to a bunch of their sites, actually they're huge on Facebook.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.260]   When Facebook came up, they suddenly all latched onto that because that was their...
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.620]   That's why John hasn't heard of them.
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.620]   They're networking.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:20.500]   But they actually have a bunch of instructions about citizen's arrest, what's legal, what's
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.380]   not, how to patrol, things you can do.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.380]   A lot of them essentially do a lot of...
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.380]   A lot of seminars.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.700]   A lot of them do volunteer work.
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.700]   So they help the homeless.
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.700]   So they can't beat a guy...
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:29.700]   No, you can't.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:33.020]   You can't beat him down and then turn him to the police.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.020]   I mean there's been a couple of documentaries done on them.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.020]   So it's...
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.020]   You know what?
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.020]   I actually don't mind.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:42.940]   It's kind of cool that people take an active civic interest in their communities that way
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:47.700]   and if they need to do it in a colorful or somewhat...
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.420]   It's really cosplay, isn't it?
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:50.420]   Let's be honest.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.260]   It is in so much that they're trying to...
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:57.520]   It's kind of like taking yourself out of whatever you do normally and putting yourself in a position
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.340]   where you're a little more... you're in a position to help people because it's very empowering.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.180]   I have a confession for you all.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.180]   Sure.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.180]   I've done this one night.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.180]   You did?
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.180]   Yeah, I did.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.180]   What were you?
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.180]   He was a YouTuber.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.180]   This was years ago.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:14.180]   I'm not surprised by this.
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.100]   No, this was in Seattle.
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.180]   One night I went to the costume store and I was out there for like two hours but I was
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.180]   hiding in the bushes.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.180]   What were you doing?
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.180]   I have no idea.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.460]   Weren't you afraid of getting shot?
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.460]   I wasn't in my right mind.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.380]   No, no, no.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:29.380]   I was completely sane.
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:30.380]   You were happy.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:31.380]   I just wanted to try it.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.380]   A few too many Twizzlers.
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.380]   I think so.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.380]   I was young.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:35.380]   I wanted to try it.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.380]   There was no particular costume?
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:39.500]   I had a big cape and maybe I called myself Black Man.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.500]   I'm not sure what the thing was.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.100]   I just kind of patrolled my apartment area.
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.500]   He was leaving out details for some reason.
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.500]   No, I'm not.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.500]   I didn't run into anything.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:52.500]   Except for Squirrel, which scared the hell out of me.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:56.140]   That was about it.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.260]   There is a...
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.860]   They actually often form groups.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.580]   Kind of like the X-Men or the Avengers.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.580]   They get together.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:04.580]   Wow.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.740]   There's actually one in the Bay Area.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.580]   I'm trying to remember the name of it.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.380]   For some reason they latch onto cosplayers too.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.100]   I have a couple of friends who are big cosplayers.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.100]   This is interesting.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.820]   They just kind of show up on their friends list.
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:21.220]   A lot of it seems kind of like maybe not such a smart idea.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:27.340]   Like trying to stop a crime in progress, especially with people who are committing violence because
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.220]   that doesn't sound too safe.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:36.220]   What's surprising is how far reaching it's been because there are ones in Italy.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:38.180]   There's a couple in Hong Kong.
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.180]   People are strange.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.180]   Well, you know what?
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.180]   I think...
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.180]   We all are strange.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.220]   I think the internet has allowed people who would have been normally seen as isolated
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:47.820]   to connect with other like-minded individuals.
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.860]   I think you're exactly right.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.860]   This is an internet phenomenon.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:51.860]   And so they support each other.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:52.860]   It's kind of a...
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.580]   It's a support group slash...
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.580]   That is very interesting.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.580]   Interesting.
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:01.060]   I should have connected with them when I had my one night out there.
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.060]   You could have been still doing that.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.500]   You know there's actually a big community in Chicago as well.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.820]   Could have stayed in shape too.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:07.820]   They got things on that too.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.820]   Workout routines.
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:09.820]   Interesting.
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.700]   We're going to take a break, come back and we'll talk about Google's new plan to let
[01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:15.900]   you manage your digital afterlife.
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.700]   What happens when you die to your Google+ account?
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.700]   Well, we'll tell you.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.780]   Well, the same thing happened to it before.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:21.780]   Nothing.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:26.100]   Things pick up a little bit.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.100]   I love Google+
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:29.100]   No, I know.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:30.100]   I do too.
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.100]   The Ben Stiller movie was called...
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.100]   Oh crap.
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:33.940]   What was it?
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:34.940]   Not the specials.
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.940]   That was the other one.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:36.940]   My Night at Bernie's?
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.940]   What was that one where they dragged the big guy?
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.940]   Mystery Men.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.940]   That was it.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.940]   Mystery Men.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:43.940]   Oh yeah.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:44.940]   Right.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:45.940]   It was really, really bad.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:46.940]   I actually preferred the specials better.
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:47.940]   That was an indie movie.
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.380]   Are you talking about something else?
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.380]   I don't know what he's talking about.
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.380]   He's actually going off the deep end.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.380]   No, I'm just following.
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.380]   I'm just...
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.380]   Sorry.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.380]   Oh, he's talking to the chat room in kind of a secondary conversation.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.380]   Sorry.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.380]   We can't at Bernie's.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:58.380]   That's the one I was thinking about.
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.780]   But that's another story.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.700]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at audible.com.
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.700]   I want you to sign up for the platinum plan.
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.100]   That's the deal we have for you this week.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.900]   Two books a month, but your first month is free.
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:11.900]   Your first two books are free.
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.420]   Cancel anytime in the first 30 days and the books are yours to keep forever.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.340]   It's just also great because you get a free subscription as with all the subscription
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:24.780]   plans to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times Daily Audio, which is really a
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.780]   nice thing to have.
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:26.780]   That comes with it.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.780]   I didn't know that.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:28.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.380]   I mean, it's really a good deal.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:34.300]   I want you to visit audible.com, a great source of audiobooks.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:36.620]   We're big Audible fans, as you probably know.
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:43.860]   In fact, I should show you since I got it here, the Audible app for Windows 8, the Metro
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.460]   app, is very cool.
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.860]   So what's nice about Audible is your library is always available.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:53.580]   I have something like 500 books in my library and I can go look at any one of them.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:54.580]   I can listen to them.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:58.620]   Let me see what, you know, I just downloaded the Great North Road from Peter F. Hamilton.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.580]   He's one of my favorite sci-fi authors.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.580]   Audible's got a great sci-fi collection, but classics too.
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:08.100]   Here's, you know, William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair, for instance, or Black Beauty.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.100]   You know, the kids love Audible too.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.380]   They've got young adult children's books.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.420]   It's a great way to get kids listening to books.
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.740]   Bestsellers, fiction and nonfiction.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.020]   I listen to a lot of history.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.780]   I'll find that end of money that's on here too somewhere.
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:25.060]   What's the advantage of hearing versus reading in your opinion?
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.980]   I find, and this is going to differ, and this is one of the reasons we want you to try before
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:31.700]   you buy, I find it sinks in better.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.500]   Because I spend a lot of time in the car.
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.860]   You probably fly around a lot.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:40.980]   The nice thing about Audible is you can read books at times when you couldn't normally
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:41.980]   hold a book.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.660]   So I listen to the car at the gym.
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.100]   So boring on the StairMaster.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:46.380]   I could see you do a lot of that.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.580]   I do every single month.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.660]   And Audible is really great for making the time pass.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.780]   It's fantastic.
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:55.780]   And I'm learning stuff.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:56.900]   This is the end of money.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:02.220]   Say goodbye to your beloved Benjamins because the world is going cashless.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.380]   David Wolman, the author, explores the drastic implications.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.380]   How's it happening?
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.380]   What's at stake?
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.380]   What does it mean?
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:11.100]   I learned a lot about economics, about fiat currency, about Bitcoin and all of that.
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.100]   What a great book.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.100]   But you don't have to just learn.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.260]   You can also enjoy.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:19.420]   Frankenstein, The Modern Prometheus, Wuthering Heights.
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:20.420]   So many great books.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:22.660]   This is my library going way, way back.
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:24.580]   You read a lot.
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.220]   Well this is 11 years with Audible.
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.500]   I've been reading for a long time or listening I guess we should say.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:30.500]   I wasn't even born.
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:33.220]   This is the book that inspired the Lincoln movie we were just talking about, Team of
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.900]   Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.460]   Really a great, great piece of history.
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:39.460]   Fascinating.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:43.060]   So you're going to find plenty to listen to.
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:49.240]   One of my favorite Audible books, one that Trey Ratcliffe recommended to me, The King
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.940]   Cruella Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:54.820]   Patrick Rothfuss is going to be our guest on Wednesday on Triangulation.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:58.420]   I'm very excited about interviewing him because I've listened to the first two books on Audible
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.800]   and we're waiting for the third.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.140]   He's writing it right now.
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:05.700]   So we'll get some, maybe get some, have you read The King Cruella Chronicles?
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.060]   God, you would love those.
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.060]   I don't believe I have.
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.060]   They're fantastic.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.100]   He's just wonderful.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.100]   So many choices.
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.460]   Pick one, pick two.
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.460]   Why not?
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:14.460]   They're free.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:19.180]   There it is, The Name of the Wind, King Cruella Chronicles Day One by Patrick Rothfuss.
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:20.180]   These two would be fantastic.
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:21.180]   You've listened to it too, Chad.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.300]   I see it's in your library.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.940]   Audible.com/twittwo.
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:31.420]   Get some reading done while you're walking, hiking, working out, cleaning the house, walking
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   the dog, driving the car.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.180]   I want to hear you.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.180]   I want to do an Audible book.
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.180]   Do an Audible book.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.180]   I just don't, you know, I don't have time.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.500]   They've asked me in the past.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.380]   I just don't, it would take, it takes a few weeks to do it.
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:43.380]   We made some ice cream.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.380]   Would you like some strawberry ice cream?
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.380]   I tried it.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:47.460]   Did you really just bring a whole container?
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.660]   Well, that's what's left over from the ice cream.
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:50.660]   They're bad.
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:51.660]   They're bad.
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.660]   They're bad for you.
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:22:00.060]   So John brought a big basket of strawberries out here, a little knife, and then Jeff, our
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:02.860]   intern just took them from him and said, they're bad.
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:05.140]   I don't know if he meant they've gone bad or they were bad for you.
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.780]   They could be rotten.
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.780]   They're rotten.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:08.780]   They're moldy.
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.780]   He saved your life.
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.780]   He saved your life.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:11.780]   I would have known.
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:14.620]   No, in fact molds, they make penicillin out of.
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:15.780]   Some mold's not good for you.
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:16.780]   It'd make you sick.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:17.780]   Cheesy mold?
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:18.780]   That's good.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.780]   Your stomach would have been in trouble.
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:21.260]   Audible.com/twittwo, get your books today.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:24.820]   Thank you very much Audible for your support of our show.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.500]   The weirdest twit we have ever done without a doubt.
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.260]   There's a bunch of black mold on cheese.
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.260]   You don't want to eat it.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.180]   Yeah, well that, now isn't cheese made of mold?
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.180]   No, cheese.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:39.260]   Is cheese made of mold?
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:40.260]   Wow.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.260]   Gee.
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.980]   I don't know if I should use the word cheese.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.900]   We all know quality cheese is made of vegetable.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.900]   It's all stone.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:52.580]   I don't mean made of mold, but you can't have cheese without mold, right?
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:53.580]   Certain cheese.
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.580]   Certain cheese.
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:55.580]   What's blue cheese?
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:56.580]   What's the blue?
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.580]   Blue cheese is a specific type of cheese.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.580]   They put bread crumbs in there.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.580]   Mold cures.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:03.780]   Yeah, it's a penicillium style of mold and it gets in there and it flavors the cheese.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:07.020]   But 99% of all cheese is not made of mold.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:10.740]   That's what I'm wondering because I've got cheeses gone moldy and I thought, "Well, that's
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:11.740]   normal."
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.260]   No, do not eat it.
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:17.420]   Or cook it.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.420]   I'm scared.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.780]   Boy, I don't know what's in the icebox in this place, the refrigerator.
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:26.060]   So Google, this is a strange post and if it had been April 1st, I would have thought it
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.060]   was a joke.
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:30.220]   It's from the Google Public Policy blog, but it came out April 11th.
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:32.420]   This can't be a joke, right?
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:39.020]   The Google Inactive Account Manager, you can tell us what to do with your Gmail messages
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:44.860]   and data from other services if your account becomes inactive for any reason, most particularly
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:47.740]   because you passed on.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:50.220]   Your digital afterlife is like leaving a will.
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.220]   How about this?
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.220]   How about you quit?
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.220]   I don't want to be on Google Mail anymore.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:54.220]   Yeah, it could be that also.
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.220]   It could be that also.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.460]   But you have to know well in advance of your expiration.
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:02.060]   If you quit, probably what you would want is just everything to be deleted.
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:03.060]   But this is like ...
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.300]   You could back up everything.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.580]   No, if you quit, you might not want to.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.500]   Most of the stuff in the Google account is junk.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:10.900]   Anyway, so just my opinion.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.860]   But you might want your data ... If you pass on, you might want your data to be shared
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:16.020]   with a trusted friend or family member.
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.020]   I don't think so.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.020]   Or a YouTube video.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.100]   Well, then you would want to do this because you would say ... Because look, you're going
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.100]   to be dead, John.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:23.940]   So you won't be able to delete your Gmail account.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:27.420]   So you would want to give them instructions now what to do if you're inactive.
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:28.420]   Wouldn't you?
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:32.220]   If you were smart money, you would be taking procedural things.
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.500]   You would be doing procedural things to keep the Gmail account from accumulating a bunch
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:37.500]   of crap.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:38.500]   No, no.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.500]   The key is what happens to your account.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.220]   Please explain this to him.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:45.220]   So basically after you toss off your mortal coil and you're sitting in the door ...
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.220]   It could happen.
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:48.420]   You could go out the door and get hit by a bus.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:50.100]   There's no buses on this street.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:54.060]   That's because Petaluma Batman kept them off.
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:58.860]   So you set a timeout period after which your account can be classed as inactive.
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:03.660]   It starts ... Every time you sign in, it resets it, but it starts with your last sign in.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:07.780]   The manager will alert you via email or text message before the timeout period ends like,
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.180]   "Hey, are you dead yet?"
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.180]   Because you haven't used ...
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.180]   Are you dead yet?
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:14.180]   People have been asking me that for the last decade.
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:15.180]   Another column?
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.180]   When is this guy going to quit?
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:23.120]   Then you will automatically send out an email to contacts saying, "John C. Dvorak is no longer
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.180]   with us, but he gave you the keys to his Gmail account if you'd like it."
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.180]   Or optionally, you could delete it.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:34.020]   How about somebody just scamming you going, "John Dvorak," or you say, "You, Leo Lepore
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:35.020]   just passed away.
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.020]   Can I have his account?"
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:37.980]   This sounds like an opportunity to ...
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:41.220]   No, this is you in your account setting this up so that can't happen.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.220]   You have an alert.
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.940]   You have a timeout period.
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:44.940]   No way.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:46.380]   No one steals your stuff while you're gone.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.380]   Notify contacts ...
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:48.380]   They can't run up your credit card bill.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:53.340]   To 10 trusted friends or family members who should be notified that your account is inactive.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:56.980]   You can share data so you can say, "Here's a special auto responder."
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:58.580]   I want to ... I don't understand what this is.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:01.260]   If you're reading this, I'm dead.
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:02.260]   You're reading it.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.260]   I'm dead or incapacitated.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.260]   I want ...
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:08.180]   An auto responder that says, "If you're reading this, I'm dead."
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.180]   Yes.
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.180]   Yes.
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:11.180]   What if you're in a coma?
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.020]   You could be in a coma and it would trigger it.
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.460]   Maybe inactive.
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:18.260]   Maybe some sort of kill switch inside you so after you're physically dead, it goes off.
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.260]   Send the signal.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.260]   What if you've been kidnapped and you could send it off?
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.060]   If you're reading this ... Okay, so what should I say?
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.820]   If you're reading this, I am incapacitated.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   You're really doing this.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:28.820]   Or possibly dead.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:29.820]   Okay, that's good.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.660]   You're making a bunch of options.
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:32.660]   Give people something to talk about.
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:33.660]   How do you spell incapacitated?
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:34.660]   I don't know.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:37.660]   That's like capacitance with a T.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.660]   Incapacitated.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.660]   How about if you're reading this?
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:40.660]   Or possibly ... Oh, good.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.660]   They have spell check even if you're dead.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.660]   Or possibly dead.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:45.140]   Okay, that's the subject line.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.140]   Well, wait.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.140]   You got to make it a little more humorous.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:50.620]   Put a period at the end of that sentence and then put who knows with a question mark.
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:51.980]   Or possibly dead.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.100]   Who knows?
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.260]   And then say, "I was Batman."
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.580]   I was Batman.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.580]   So then that's it.
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:04.140]   Have you ever ... You know what's going to happen is I'm going to forget about this?
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.860]   I am going to die.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:09.820]   And this is going to go out ... What the hell?
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:12.580]   The guy's Batman?
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:14.540]   And then say ... It all makes sense.
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:15.540]   Okay.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.540]   That's safe.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.660]   Who could do that many shows in a week?
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:20.020]   Do I want my account deleted?
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.020]   No.
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.020]   No.
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.020]   Is that a no or an on?
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.020]   Oh, it's a no.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:25.020]   Okay.
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.820]   Add trusted notify contacts.
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.020]   Okay, now what's the timeout period?
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.860]   If I haven't signed in my Google account for ...
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:33.860]   One year.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:34.860]   One year.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:37.740]   That's a long time, but that means a year after I'm dead before this happens.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:40.660]   Well, make it a month.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.660]   What's a good compromise?
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.660]   Six months.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:43.660]   Six months.
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:48.540]   So if I don't sign in my Google account for six months, you're going to get an email that
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:49.540]   says I was Batman.
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:50.540]   Okay.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.540]   I'm in.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:52.540]   Can I be CC'd on this?
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:55.540]   No, it's okay.
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:56.540]   We've actually ...
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:02.260]   From now on, if I get an email to my account, you'll get a responder that says, "I'm dead,
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:03.260]   but I was Batman."
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.020]   That is a title.
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:09.500]   What if you're young enough and you actually outlive the Google service?
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:14.700]   Okay, this is a good question.
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.860]   Do you think that ... How long is Google going to be around?
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.860]   Longer than me?
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.860]   No.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:19.860]   Longer than John?
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.860]   Definitely not.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:21.860]   Oh, I think they're here to stay.
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:22.860]   Longer than John.
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.500]   Who's going to live longer, you or Google?
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.500]   I think Google will.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.500]   Really?
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:28.500]   I think they'll evolve into something unstoppable.
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.500]   But will they keep the Gmail?
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.500]   That's the key.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500]   Oh, why not?
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.500]   Or is email dying?
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.500]   Well, they killed Reader.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:35.500]   They killed Reader?
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.500]   No one was using Reader.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:37.500]   People use Gmail.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.500]   Not mainstream people.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.500]   People were using Reader.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.500]   I don't think they made money on Gmail.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.500]   What are they making?
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.900]   How are they making money on Gmail?
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.140]   Display ads.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:50.420]   You saw that the guy named Moen, whatever his name was, Neil Moen, they gave him $100 million
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:52.500]   to run display ads, not to leave.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.500]   He was going to take a job at Facebook.
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.900]   They said, "Here's, I'd like to write you a check."
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.620]   And they gave him $100 million, not to leave.
[01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:58.620]   I think this actually brings up a broader ...
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:00.300]   There's no money in that stuff.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.860]   This brings up a broader question.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:06.660]   There are so many sites, social networking sites, and various online services that people
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:08.420]   are using today.
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:12.460]   Who would you leave in charge to make sure all those things are closed down?
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:16.460]   I think more likely, I know what you're saying, but I think more likely somebody's just going
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.380]   to abandon their account because they're going to find something better or something else.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.420]   They're going to forget that they put this in play.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.420]   Well, no.
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.420]   What you could do ...
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:26.420]   Boom.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:27.420]   No.
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.420]   Perfect.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:29.420]   Oh my God, Leo died.
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:30.420]   No, you don't have to do that.
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.420]   You don't have to do the email.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.660]   You could just say, "Hey, if I don't use my account in six months, please delete it."
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.660]   That's one of the options.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:34.660]   Oh, that's good.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:35.660]   Isn't that good?
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:36.980]   I had to do this when my friend passed away.
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:40.500]   His wife asked me to basically go through, because she didn't know what they all were,
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.500]   to go through all the accounts and close them down.
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.500]   Precisely.
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.500]   This is a good thing.
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.500]   Now, I have a horror story.
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:49.220]   I have a classmate of mine who found me on Facebook a couple years ago, and he was messaging
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:53.140]   all of us and just daily talking about his life and things in the past.
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:54.140]   Then you stopped?
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.140]   No, no.
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.140]   Come to find out.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:01.260]   A month into this, I found out he died two years ago, and his wife was continuing it
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.260]   as if she was him.
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:03.260]   It's kind of creepy.
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:04.260]   It was very creepy.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.260]   It was very unsettling.
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:08.500]   I would like it to be deleted, where someone can't do that.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:13.540]   There's an app for Facebook called the ifidied.net that is an app that allows you to kind of do
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:14.540]   something similar with your Facebook.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.540]   Well, Facebook has this process.
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:18.580]   There are a bunch of morbid people that are on these social networks.
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.340]   There are.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:22.140]   But we're all going to go, John.
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:23.740]   Well, you have plans or something?
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:24.740]   No, no, no, no.
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.820]   But I mean, I'm just wondering what happens to your Facebook?
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.060]   It just gets inactive?
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.060]   In my case?
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.060]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.060]   I don't use Facebook.
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.060]   Hey, yo.
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.060]   You'll leave no trace.
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.060]   Leave no trace.
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.060]   You'll just be a little smoke.
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.540]   You are as footprints upon the sand of time.
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.540]   You mean you have no Facebook account?
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:40.540]   Exactly.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.980]   You didn't understand that from his previous says?
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:42.980]   You want me to say it again?
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.980]   You are?
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:44.980]   There's John C. Dvorak on Facebook.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.980]   That's Facebook.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:46.980]   Yeah, not me.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:47.980]   Okay.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.260]   I don't even know who those people are.
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:52.140]   Do you write columns for like the future?
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:55.100]   Do you write them out six months out and then they publish them later?
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:57.180]   I always write it in advance a little bit.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:58.660]   So I'm just wondering, would it be possible?
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:30:59.940]   I can't go six months.
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:00.940]   No.
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:02.940]   I cannot write six months worth of columns in advance.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.940]   Unless you have six months to live.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:09.180]   If I had six months to live, I'd probably go to some...
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.180]   No, I wouldn't.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:11.180]   I'd probably stop writing.
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.180]   Yeah, at that point.
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:16.020]   I was going to say something else, but I'm decided against it.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:17.020]   Your legacy is...
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:21.180]   I already got in trouble with the teenage hookers going across the headlines.
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:23.780]   That was the man act, not the Volstead act, by the way.
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:24.780]   I know that.
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:26.420]   It wasn't the woman act?
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:30.220]   No, it was the man to ends act.
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:33.340]   Show today brought to you by stamps.com.
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.340]   You know what the word in...
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.340]   I know, he'll know this, indicia.
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.340]   No?
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:37.340]   No.
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:39.620]   You're the kind of guy I would think would know all of these.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:42.380]   Isn't that the little, like the symbol out of stamp thing?
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.380]   It's like a stamp?
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:44.380]   Well, I'm...
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.380]   Think what it is.
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:49.900]   It's the act that goes over that cancels the stamps in indicia, isn't it?
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:53.860]   It's the postal markings affixed to mail.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:58.740]   So it's postal markings imprinted on mailer labels to be affixed to mail.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:02.380]   It is stamps, or indicia.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:03.940]   Okay.
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:07.220]   But the reason it comes up is because this is what stamps.com does.
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:08.900]   This is a company that sells indicia.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:09.900]   You use stamps.com.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:10.900]   I do.
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:11.900]   Because when...
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:14.380]   I've gotten mail from you, and it's got a stamp...
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.740]   Now the question on my mind is, can't you make the stamp a little fancier?
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:18.740]   You can.
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:19.740]   Well, why don't you?
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:20.740]   Do we not have our logo on it?
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.740]   Nope.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:22.740]   You got just...
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:23.740]   Oh, we got to put our logo on it.
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:24.740]   I'll help...
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.740]   It says it's got your name, but I would like to see your face.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:26.740]   You could do that.
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:27.740]   I can have my head.
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:29.740]   Yes, I want to see your head on the stamp.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:34.540]   So, okay, so we send checks out to hosts, and when we do it, we have the address book,
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:38.700]   so that stamps.com prints the address, our return address, the postage.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:39.700]   It doesn't print a logo.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   It prints the company name.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.700]   Is that all it says?
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.700]   Oh, it should really have something better.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:44.700]   I can have my head.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:45.700]   So we're going to...
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.700]   But we can do that.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.700]   You can have a logo.
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:48.700]   You can have anything.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:51.540]   We've got the USB scale, so if you have a package, you put it on there.
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.140]   It prints exactly the right postage.
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.140]   It prints it right onto a label you affixed to the box.
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.380]   You can do any class of mail.
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:01.060]   If you're doing international, mailstamps.com will fill out the forms for you automatically.
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.060]   You print them out.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.060]   You're ready to go.
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:04.060]   And here's the beauty part.
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.060]   You don't even then...
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.060]   You don't even have to go to the post office.
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.060]   You just...
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:08.060]   The mail carrier comes to you, and all this stuff's ready.
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.060]   He just takes it.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.020]   You can even schedule special pickups.
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.020]   You do not have to get up.
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:15.580]   You do not have to go to the post office ever again, and you don't need to pay extra for
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:18.940]   a postage meter or the special ink or anything.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:21.660]   You're using your computer, your printer, and stamps.com.
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:22.660]   This is not for everybody.
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.120]   This is for people who do a lot of mailing in your business.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:30.260]   If you sell on Etsy, for instance, or you do any kind of fulfillment, you'd love stamps.com.
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:37.260]   In fact, if you're sending priority mail or express mail, it will automatically email
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:41.100]   the recipient with the tracking code so they know.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:42.100]   It's just a great deal.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:43.900]   Visit stamps.com right now.
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:47.780]   They've sent out over two billion letters in packages, and I think we've done about half
[01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:48.780]   a million of those.
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:49.780]   We use it all the time.
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:50.780]   So you like the post office.
[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.780]   I mean, you like the postal system.
[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:53.780]   Yes.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:54.780]   Well, then why wouldn't...
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:55.780]   Don't you?
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:34:00.340]   Of course I do, but when we had the discussion most recently, you said as far as you're concerned
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:02.820]   and the other guys at post office could go away.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.820]   I didn't say that.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.820]   Well, somebody did.
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.500]   Somebody's got to come to your home and deliver your check.
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:08.540]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:09.540]   Should I?
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.540]   I mean, how would we...
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:11.540]   I mean, I'm not going to send you a bitcoin.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:12.540]   In fact, why don't we send you checks?
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.700]   Why don't we just send you bitcoins or something?
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.020]   Like just some transfer money over to you.
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:18.020]   I'd like to check.
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:19.020]   You'd like to check.
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.020]   Of course.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.020]   It's not fiat.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.740]   I can look at it and shake it.
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:23.740]   No.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.740]   The check is...
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:25.740]   Well, anyway.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:26.740]   There's a promise right now.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:29.580]   Oh, somebody's got an image for me to use in stamps.com.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.140]   My dad actually uses stamps.com.
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:33.700]   Everybody who does a lot of mailing knows about this.
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:34.900]   It's really great.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.300]   We have people walking out on the show.
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.300]   I've seen this.
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.300]   Huh?
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:41.380]   I've seen this show has been driving a couple of people out of the audience.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:42.380]   The audience...
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:43.380]   You probably had to go.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:46.940]   I have never seen the audience thin like this in my life.
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:47.940]   I won't come back.
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:48.940]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.540]   I figure it's a physical world analog for what's really happening.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.540]   You'll never be back either.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:52.540]   Right.
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:53.540]   Well, I thought they left because of me.
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:54.540]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:55.540]   No, no, no.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.380]   In any event, go to stamps.com.
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:00.660]   Click the...
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:01.660]   What is that?
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:02.660]   Is that the picture they want you to use?
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.660]   I think you need to clear your cash, but this is stamps.com.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:05.660]   Look at mine.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.660]   Look at mine.
[01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:07.660]   I know.
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:08.660]   I know where she was on...
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:09.660]   What's wrong with mine?
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:10.660]   See?
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:11.660]   Clear your cash.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:12.660]   No.
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:13.660]   This is what you don't want.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:14.660]   Right?
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:15.660]   This is the front page of stamps.com.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:16.660]   Click the link.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:17.660]   Okay.
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.660]   And we enter in "Twit."
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:19.660]   Right?
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:20.660]   Press "Go."
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:24.100]   And that special offer, $80 offer, turns into $110.
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:25.300]   What's wrong with all this?
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:26.300]   Is this not the look?
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:27.300]   It's the same.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.300]   Is that the picture you want to have on the stamp?
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:30.300]   That picture there?
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.300]   What was that?
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:32.300]   This is stamps.com.
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:33.300]   That's their new front page?
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:35.300]   They changed it.
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:36.300]   So they still have a radio microphone.
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.300]   She's prettier than you are.
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:38.300]   She's pretty looking.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.300]   Right.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.300]   And now that I have it...
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:41.300]   See, I don't want to buy it now.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:42.300]   $110 bonus.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.300]   I'm just recommending on the stamp itself, it should have your head.
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.500]   Well, somebody...
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.100]   Did you see chat in the chat room, Chad?
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:50.540]   I shouldn't call you "Chat."
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.540]   Chat room Chad.
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:52.540]   Chat.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:55.300]   Did you see somebody had a suggestion for an image that we could use for the logo on
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:56.300]   our...
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.300]   Is it a good image, Jeff?
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.300]   Did you see it?
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.300]   It's probably lewd.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.300]   It's probably lewd.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.060]   There it is in the image...
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.060]   The image check.
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.060]   That one?
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.060]   Yeah.
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.060]   No.
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.060]   That's no good.
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.060]   I would tear up that envelope.
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:09.060]   It doesn't even look like you.
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.060]   You just got a letter.
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:11.060]   What?
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:14.060]   I said, "You money?"
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.060]   Anyway, you can't...
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.060]   Whatever.
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.060]   You could use that.
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:20.060]   Whatever you want.
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:21.060]   Stamps.com.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:24.060]   Click the radio microphone in the upper right-hand corner.
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:28.060]   Use our offer code TWIT and you will get a very nice trial offer.
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:31.060]   $55 in free postage to use over the first few months.
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:32.060]   Free digital scale.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:33.060]   $5 supply kit.
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:37.060]   And a four-week trial of Stamps.com.
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:38.060]   Give it a try today.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:41.060]   They're a great company with a great service.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.060]   What's App?
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:44.060]   Not selling to Google.
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:45.060]   That was a lie.
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:48.060]   They said Google is going to buy it for a billion dollars.
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.060]   Buy who?
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:50.060]   WhatsApp?
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:51.060]   You think they were covering up though?
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:53.060]   I think they're covering up.
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:54.060]   You think so?
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.060]   That they really were talking to them?
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.060]   I think so.
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.060]   Google is, we're pretty sure, launching a chat service called Babble.
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.060]   And I think they need something like WhatsApp to...
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:03.060]   Because WhatsApp is on everything. It's cross-platform.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.060]   They've got a great infrastructure.
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:05.060]   Because I love Talk.
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:07.060]   That's one of the reasons I came back to Android.
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.060]   I love Google Talk.
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.060]   That's their IM system.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.060]   Yeah, but it's very difficult to use on iOS.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:14.060]   You have to use third-party app and sometimes it turns off.
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.060]   That's a good point.
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:16.060]   And WhatsApp is on iOS.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:18.060]   And it's exactly the same on iOS as it is on Android.
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.060]   Now, WhatsApp doesn't have as a desktop version.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.060]   I wish they did.
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:25.060]   Yeah, and Google can provide that.
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:27.060]   I'm really interested in this new unified.
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:31.060]   Because they have Google Messenger, Google+ Messenger.
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.060]   They have the Google Talk.
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.060]   They have...
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.060]   They have too many.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.060]   Google Voice.
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.060]   Yeah, Google Voice.
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.060]   Yeah, and I think there's a couple others.
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:38.060]   There's chat that's inside the...
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.060]   Let's get it all together.
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.060]   Yeah, inside the document there's chat.
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.060]   Right.
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.060]   So there's...
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:44.060]   We use that all the time while we're inside Google Drive.
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:46.060]   Is this a Hangout chat?
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.060]   Hangouts have their own...
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.060]   Hangouts, yeah.
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:52.060]   But what I really would like is not only unified across Google, but also use SMS.
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:56.060]   See, Apple kind of has that with Messages, where you send a message,
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.060]   it will use SMS.
[01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:59.060]   First it'll try to use the Internet.
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:00.060]   If it can't, it'll use SMS.
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:03.060]   But it only works with other iOS users.
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:05.060]   Wouldn't it be great if we're completely cross-platform?
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.060]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:08.060]   I use the Facebook Messenger with my SMS.
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:09.060]   I combine that.
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:10.060]   Well, that's why I think Facebook Home's interesting.
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:14.060]   It really encourages you to live in Facebook with video chat, messaging, and everything.
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.060]   I just accepted it.
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.060]   There's a billion people using it.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:19.060]   I was like, "Why was I fighting it all the time?"
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.060]   So stop fighting it, people who don't like Facebook.
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.060]   But I do.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.060]   I really think Google has a huge opportunity, if they can get it together,
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:29.060]   to provide a unified chat, a unified interface, put it on Android.
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:30.060]   Absolutely.
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.060]   Put it on the desktop.
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.060]   I think there's a real opportunity.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:33.060]   I've been waiting for that for the longest.
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:37.060]   Wouldn't you rather do that with Google than with Facebook?
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:38.060]   Me, for sure.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:41.060]   Would you trust Google?
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:42.060]   I don't trust Google.
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.060]   You don't have to trust them to use this, though.
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:45.060]   Right.
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.060]   I don't trust them.
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.060]   50/50.
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:49.060]   50/50.
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:50.060]   It's all the same.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.060]   Six and one half, a dozen and the other.
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.060]   I think they're going to buy them.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:55.060]   There are people who are active on Facebook that don't really have a Google.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:58.060]   Well, that's the problem is that you're going to go where your friends are.
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:38:59.060]   Yeah.
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.060]   That's why Facebook has such lock-in.
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:04.060]   It was like AIM before it, AOL before it, and MySpace.
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:07.060]   I have about six, seven people that still use it.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:08.060]   You still use AIM?
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:11.060]   I use it because these seven people still use it.
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:12.060]   I got down to one person.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:13.060]   I just said, "I'm killing it."
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:17.060]   So my thing, have you seen this?
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:18.060]   A phone?
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:19.060]   No, with all these times?
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:21.060]   It's a Nexus 4, and you've got all these different times.
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:22.060]   Here, let me show the audience.
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.560]   No, you're not touching this thing.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.560]   I won't do anything.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.560]   You do that.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.560]   I don't do that.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.560]   Yeah, you take his stuff and mess it up.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.060]   He messes my stuff up, but I don't do that.
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:30.060]   So what is this app?
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:31.060]   Is this an app?
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:32.060]   No, it just showed up now.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:35.560]   I mean, they said to upgrade it, and now I got all these times from places I never go
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.560]   to.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.560]   Marengo, Zagreb.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:41.060]   I don't even know where Marengo and Almaty are.
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.060]   I know where Zagreb and Adelaide are.
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:45.060]   Adelaide's Australia, South Australia.
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.060]   Zagreb is the old...
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:48.060]   Is this your homepage now?
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.060]   It's the...
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:50.060]   It's not the homepage.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:51.060]   It's not the homepage.
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:52.060]   So you'll view this lobby.
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:53.060]   What do they call it now, though?
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:54.060]   It's the pre-open page.
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:55.060]   Oh, okay, the launcher.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.060]   Launcher.
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.060]   It's now part of Croatia.
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:59.060]   It's Croatia.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.060]   Maybe they're encouraging you to go visit these places.
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:05.060]   I've been to Zagreb a couple times, but I've never been to those other places.
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.060]   Is this the home screen?
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:07.060]   What is this?
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:08.060]   This is the launch screen.
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:09.060]   Is this the 4 or the Galaxy Nexus?
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.060]   Nexus 4.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.060]   No, no, that's the Galaxy Nexus.
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.060]   That's the Galaxy Nexus, yeah.
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.060]   Oh, it's the Galaxy Nexus.
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:16.060]   But they keep what's good about it.
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:21.060]   If you use the Google phone, you always have the most updated OS.
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.060]   Right.
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:25.060]   I did not know you were an Android guy.
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:26.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:27.060]   He's...
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.060]   Learning things every day.
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:30.060]   He just started using smartphones recently.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:34.060]   Last week, I got one of these things.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.060]   It seems to work.
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.060]   It's like a calculator.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.060]   You poke it.
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.060]   My mom swears by BlackBerry.
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:42.060]   I had one until I bought a Nexus 4 last year.
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:47.060]   I had a caller today on the radio show say, "I have a BlackBerry Torch.
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.060]   Should I get the new BlackBerry?"
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:50.060]   I said, "Definitely."
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:51.060]   I jumped.
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:52.060]   Waste no time.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.060]   Is it one of the apps I really like?
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:56.060]   What is this stuff you're doing with your phone?
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.060]   Long press to save.
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:59.060]   Annoying high-pitched, annoying alarm.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:00.060]   Are these sounds?
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.060]   So if I press one, it's going to do that?
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:06.060]   Here's an annoying high-pitched sound.
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:09.060]   Okay, but why does it look like that?
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:10.060]   The symbol.
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:13.060]   It's because John is long-suffering.
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:14.060]   Okay.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:16.060]   It's getting more annoying.
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.060]   Much like the owner.
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:20.060]   Oh, geez.
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:22.060]   Any time you can stop.
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:25.060]   Pull the battery.
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:28.060]   Most of my hearing is still intact.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.060]   What's that one?
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.060]   Who was zealous?
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:35.060]   Drunk chipmunk.
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:39.060]   Do they have the jump in the shark one?
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:40.060]   Did you pay for this?
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.060]   No, of course not.
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:44.060]   You think I paid for it?
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.060]   You did just get a smartphone, didn't you?
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:50.060]   I think it's for the times that he needs to laugh in a social occasion,
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:52.060]   but he just can't muster it, and he just hits it on his phone.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:55.060]   By the way, these sound effects apps are great in meetings.
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:56.060]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:57.060]   Those meetings are boring.
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:58.060]   End that meeting fast.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.060]   In fact, it's pretty much the end of this show.
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:02.060]   I'm working on it.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.060]   Any other stories that we want to talk about?
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:05.060]   We covered the Facebook home, right?
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:06.060]   Yeah, we did that.
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:07.060]   I finished Bioshock Infinite.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:08.060]   Oh, did you like it?
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:09.060]   What did you think?
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.060]   I finished it two weeks ago.
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:11.060]   What do you think of the ending?
[01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:12.060]   No, no spoilers.
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.060]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:15.060]   I'm not coming close to the ending.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.060]   No.
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:17.060]   Yes.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.060]   No.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:23.060]   But Roger and I are going to talk in encoded fashion so that we won't hurt anybody.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.060]   It's a very surprising ending.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:30.060]   It's a surprising ending, but I can say the end of the game wasn't as satisfying as I
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:31.060]   hoped.
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.060]   No.
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:33.060]   I'd hope for more, especially after that last battle.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:40.300]   For all the talk about how forward and progressive it was in addressing racism and stuff, a lot
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:41.300]   of those elements...
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:42.300]   They left that behind.
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:43.300]   A lot of those elements...
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:44.300]   This is the thing I had with this game.
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:45.700]   A lot of those elements were set pieces.
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.700]   They were window dressing.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:47.900]   They weren't really done in a...
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:48.900]   They weren't integral to the game.
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:49.900]   They weren't integral to the game.
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:52.340]   Honestly, you don't care at the end.
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:53.980]   It was another...
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:54.980]   This is the thing.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:55.980]   How do you take...
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:43:00.100]   How do you review a game and just basically you've said nothing?
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:01.100]   We can't.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:02.100]   I can't.
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   This is the point of the review.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.100]   They weren't reviewing it.
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:05.100]   I'm not.
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.100]   I'm just saying that...
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.100]   Tell us.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.100]   Come on.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.100]   Tell us what happened.
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:10.100]   This is the thing I have with this game.
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:13.060]   How do you take something that you want to be very broad minded and very...
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:16.580]   I guess you want to educate the public, but then you stick on top of a shooter.
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:17.580]   You want to make...
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:18.580]   That's right.
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:19.580]   You still have to kill a lot of people to get through the end.
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.620]   You've got to kill a lot of people and you want to promote a message of tolerance and
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:23.620]   that's not happening.
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:24.620]   It doesn't work.
[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:27.100]   Are they deliberately trying to send a moral message in this video game?
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.100]   Yes.
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:29.100]   Yes.
[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:30.100]   And it's very ham-fisted.
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:33.020]   I can say this without being a spoiler because it's so early in the game and others have
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:34.280]   talked about it.
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:40.540]   Very early on in the game, you're in this city that was built in 1912, a floating city,
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.660]   and it seems idyllic.
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:43.660]   It's Main Street Disney.
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:47.800]   I mean, it's incredible, but there's odd little dark bits to it.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.020]   You come to a raffle and you get a message that says, "Whatever you do, don't take number
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:53.820]   77."
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:56.340]   And you're at the raffle and everybody's there and everybody's excited.
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:44:01.860]   It's very fair-spirited and a girl comes to you and you say, "Well, how much for the base
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:02.860]   ... she wants to give you a baseball.
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:03.860]   How much for the baseball?"
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:04.980]   She says, "Oh no, you must be new here.
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:06.260]   It's always free at the raffle.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:07.460]   Here, take a baseball."
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:10.140]   So he does and it's number 77.
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:11.700]   So he goes, "Oh, that's interesting."
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:16.660]   Then the stage opens and the announcer comes out and it's an interracial couple in chains
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:20.140]   is marched out and the announcer says, "You've won.
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:23.060]   You get to throw the first baseball at this interracial couple."
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:26.080]   It's very ... it's like, "Oh my God."
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.620]   Then you have a choice in the game whether to throw the baseball at the interracial couple,
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:36.980]   which of course would be a evil thing to do, or to throw it at the announcer, the MC instead.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:40.660]   And you have to make what is ostensibly a deep moral decision.
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:41.660]   Well, by the way, I tried it both ways.
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.660]   That's a deep moral decision?
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:43.660]   Well, I tried it both ways.
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:46.620]   It's the same exact outcome no matter what you do.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:48.740]   Wow, that's a spoiler.
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:49.740]   It doesn't matter.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:50.740]   Well, see ...
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:51.740]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:53.740]   What if you don't take the baseball?
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:54.740]   You don't have a choice.
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:55.740]   That's a cutscene.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.740]   That sucks.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:07.180]   So, ultimately, there's a certain level of pretentious high-mindedness in the game that
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:15.540]   stems from a very poor understanding about how things ...
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:17.740]   It's pretentious, let's face it.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:18.740]   It's not done very well.
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:19.740]   This is why I'm looking for it.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:20.740]   But it's still a great game.
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:21.740]   It's a fun game.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:24.100]   Think of it as an interesting-looking first-person shooter.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:26.420]   But I will say ... It is not a deeply profound ...
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:27.420]   Okay, it shouldn't be.
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:28.420]   It shouldn't be.
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:29.420]   It's a first-person shooter.
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:31.020]   But the gameplay itself is good.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.020]   It's great.
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:33.620]   But it's not any better than the first Bioshock.
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:34.700]   Nah, maybe not.
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:35.700]   Maybe so.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.700]   I think so.
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:37.700]   I think that there are more variations.
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:42.060]   You can make it to the game through basically using two of your powers and like ...
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.060]   Vigors.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:44.060]   Vigors and whatever weapon.
[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.900]   Yeah, you only get two weapons, two vigors.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:46.900]   That's plenty.
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:50.340]   I'm looking forward to the Injustice, God's Among Us game with the DC Comics.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:51.340]   That looks good.
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:52.340]   There's no thinking involved.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.340]   You just bash people.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.340]   And that's it.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:55.340]   That's what it's done.
[01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:56.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:57.340]   No more else.
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:58.340]   All right.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:01.300]   We're pretty much ... Clearly, we've run out of whatever we had.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:02.300]   It was good.
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.540]   Do you think Warby Parker ... I was really surprised.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:08.820]   Giga Ohm ... And unfortunately, the Giga Ohm writer who was here left early.
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:09.820]   But ...
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:11.860]   You don't blame him.
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:15.340]   Giga Ohm says, "The Warby Parker ... You know, Warby Parker's a glass.
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:19.500]   The internet startup that's selling glasses frames.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:23.200]   They're creating a retail store is a big moment for online brands.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:30.180]   They're opening up a show, a store rather, in Manhattan using sensors, Wi-Fi and other
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:34.020]   technology to understand how people use their retail space and take that data and marry
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.540]   it with their online sales trends."
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.500]   Is this really a revolution?
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:38.500]   They're selling glasses frames.
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:39.500]   It's a store.
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:40.980]   It's a store.
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:41.980]   It's a store.
[01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:47.420]   And in fact, it's a store in a category that is traditionally not an online category.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:50.740]   I think what they may have discovered ... And they were an advertiser with us, disclaimer.
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:54.460]   What they may have discovered is that people really want to go in and try glasses frames
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:55.460]   before they buy them.
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:56.460]   I would hope.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:57.460]   What a revelation.
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:03.500]   I think they were ... I mean, it works for things like Zappos, but when it comes to something
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:08.620]   so critical to your everyday functioning, like glasses, it's something you want to make
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.620]   sure you test out and block out the store.
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:13.140]   The company is a darling internet startup.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.140]   For reasons I'm not completely ...
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:15.140]   Hipster glasses.
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:16.140]   They're hipster.
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:18.740]   And by the way, what's interesting is Google ... It's been rumored that Google Glass will
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:21.540]   actually go to Warby Parker to get some stylish Google Glass ...
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.540]   Get some black frames.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:23.540]   Black frames and stuff.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:24.540]   And you know what?
[01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:29.900]   In a way, they did solve the conundrum, because what you do is you order ... You pick five
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:32.760]   frames that you think might look nice, and they send you the five frames.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:35.700]   You try them all on and say, "I want that one," then you send the trial box back and
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.900]   you get the frame with your glasses prescription.
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:40.060]   So they do kind of solve that issue of how do you try them on.
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.060]   How do they solve the fitting?
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.060]   Well, they don't.
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.060]   They tweak.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:44.060]   You can't.
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:45.060]   Yeah.
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:49.780]   So what they need to do is take a device like the Kinect that you sit on your monitor and
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:53.540]   do a little 3D scan of your head, and then they find out which frames will actually fit
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:54.540]   in.
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:55.540]   That would be cool.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:56.540]   Anyway, we're out of time.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:57.540]   I want to thank Lamar Wilson for coming up here.
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:58.540]   Thank you for having me.
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:47:59.540]   I really appreciate it.
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:00.540]   I love the ... I was going to say cottage.
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.540]   I love this brick house.
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:02.540]   Whatever the hell this thing is.
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:04.540]   It's a giant studio.
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:05.540]   You're okay too.
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.940]   Some good news this week that Elisa told me.
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:09.620]   We had to take out a loan to build this.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:12.020]   We did about a million and a quarter of tenant improvements.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:13.020]   We just leased the building.
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.380]   But building a studio is expensive with all the equipment and the gear.
[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:18.780]   And Elisa told me that we paid off the loan about four years early.
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:19.780]   We have paid off the loan.
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:23.060]   We now ... we don't have any ... we're not in comfort.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.060]   It's all in the blue.
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:25.060]   There's no debt.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:26.060]   It's all in the blue.
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:27.060]   Or the black.
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:28.060]   The black.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:29.060]   I hope the black or the blue.
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.060]   It's all about the Bitcoin, baby.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:31.060]   Anyway, so that's ...
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:32.060]   Easy Bitcoin to pay it off.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:33.060]   Yeah, pay it off with Bitcoin.
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.060]   Good job.
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:35.060]   The bank loves Bitcoin.
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:36.060]   The city loves it.
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:39.060]   Anyway, it's really nice to have you on the Twitch team.
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.780]   Thank you for agreeing to doing a show with me.
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:43.580]   Lamar's the host of This Week in YouTube.
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:44.580]   Absolutely.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:45.580]   Here on Twitch.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:46.580]   You can also follow him on youtubeyoutube.com/lamarwilson.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:47.580]   Absolutely.
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:48.580]   I encourage that.
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:49.580]   And of course, Twitter.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:50.580]   Lamar Wilson.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:52.260]   And you've been doing the video a month.
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:53.260]   The video a day.
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:54.260]   The video a day thing this month.
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:55.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.260]   And it's hysterical.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:58.380]   You've got to watch some of these, especially the one, the pig's knuckles.
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:48:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:02.700]   It's called We Eat Stuff, where I eat spam for the first time.
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:03.700]   You've never had spam?
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:04.700]   I've never had spam.
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:05.700]   It's good.
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:06.700]   We ate it out of a can.
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.700]   You know it's not ...
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:08.700]   People are like, "What are you doing?
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:09.700]   You're supposed to not fry it."
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:10.700]   You fry it.
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.620]   Yeah, that was disgusting.
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:13.620]   I didn't like the texture.
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:14.620]   You drank some sort of sugar water.
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:15.620]   So you don't like anything apparently.
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:16.620]   Just like you.
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:17.620]   I like everything.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:18.620]   No you don't.
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:19.620]   You just said spam was disgusting.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:20.620]   It is.
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.620]   Do you like it?
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:25.200]   It's worth watching that video because by the time you get to the pig's feet, I was
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.200]   out.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:27.200]   All right.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.200]   All right, you got me.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.420]   John C. Dvorak does a lot of stuff, but nothing better, nothing more important, nothing more
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:35.020]   relevant than the No Agenda Show, noagendashow.com.
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:37.260]   He also is available at channeldvorak.com.
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:41.180]   And of course, dvorak.org/blog is still alive and kicking.
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:42.180]   Yep.
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.180]   Great site.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:46.060]   And I'm also on this show every so often.
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:47.300]   More often than not.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:49.980]   And it always makes for a lively moment of entertainment.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:50.980]   Discussion.
[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:51.980]   Yeah, it is fun.
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:53.380]   You bring a certain something to it.
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:54.860]   Yeah, usually sound effects.
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:55.860]   And a weird shirt.
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:56.860]   Roger check.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:57.860]   Woo!
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:58.860]   That's good.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:00.460]   That's the Cartoon Sound Effects collection.
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:01.460]   Yeah, it is.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:03.380]   And you have the perfect character that goes back.
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:08.620]   And I started doing all of this back in '91 with John, he gave me my start in technology
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:09.620]   radio.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:13.700]   And I foolishly gave him a computer loaded with sound effects.
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:14.700]   Yeah, that's a mistake.
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:16.700]   How little did he know?
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:19.460]   Ever since, it's been my great trial.
[01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:23.140]   Roger Chang is at the beautiful Revision 3 where he does Tekzilla.
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:25.220]   Yes, tekzilla.com.
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:28.140]   And the new show, it's a new show from Jim Lutterback?
[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:29.140]   Yes, youtube.com/tekfeed.
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:32.220]   So check it out there with Tekfeed News.
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:34.100]   That's part of the Tekfeed channel.
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.900]   And if you have an Xbox, you can try out our new Revision 3 app.
[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:41.740]   You guys took the brave road on that one.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.380]   So I've talked to Microsoft about getting a twit app.
[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:49.100]   And they said, "Well, we strongly prefer you use one of our certified developers."
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.100]   I said, "Well, how much is that going to be?"
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:52.460]   About $150,000.
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:53.460]   So Revision 3.
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:54.460]   They got the Disney money.
[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:55.460]   I mean, the discovery.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:56.460]   No, no, no.
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:57.460]   No, they wrote it themselves.
[01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:58.460]   They did not go that route.
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:50:59.460]   Oh, nice.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:00.500]   And I'm sure it was a lot cheaper.
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:04.500]   And then you have to go through the gauntlet of Microsoft approval, which took a while.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:05.500]   Took a very long while.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:07.500]   But you got it through and I'm impressed.
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:10.820]   And it gave me courage, the courage to ... I want to talk with you guys about how you did
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:14.940]   that because maybe we could afford to do it ourselves and manage to get through that approval
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.100]   process because it's very expensive not to do it.
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.100]   Yes.
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:20.060]   If you can do it in-house, it'd be great.
[01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:21.060]   Thank you, Roger.
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:22.060]   Great to see you.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:23.060]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:27.300]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2300
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:29.340]   UTC on twit.tv.
[01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:32.580]   Watch live if you can because then you'll see all the things that we cut out of this
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:35.020]   episode.
[01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:40.700]   If you don't watch live, you can get the on-demand safe versions at twit.tv every week.
[01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:43.100]   Hey, before we wrap things up, I want to check in with Tom Merritt.
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:44.100]   I want to thank you.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:45.100]   I know you have to run.
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:46.100]   I do.
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:47.100]   Your ride is waiting.
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:49.100]   Are they beeping outside?
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:50.100]   I'm not sure.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:51.100]   Or Jeff, you're his ride?
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:52.100]   Wherever the back car is.
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:53.100]   The back?
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:54.100]   The Batmobile.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:55.100]   You don't have the Batman.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.900]   Before we wrap it up, let's check in with Tom Merritt to see what's coming up this week
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:51:58.900]   on twit.
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:02.180]   Hey, Leo, here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:03.180]   on tech news today.
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:07.540]   Of course, today is the release of Star Wars, the Old Republic's expansion, their first
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:09.740]   expansion, Rise of the Hutt Cartel.
[01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:13.460]   Monday, April 15th kicks off D, dive into mobile.
[01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.740]   That was rescheduled because of Hurricane Sandy.
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:18.660]   It was supposed to be back last year.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:19.660]   Also it's tax day.
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:20.660]   Don't forget that.
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:24.580]   Tuesday, April 16th, Yahoo and Intel both have their earnings reports.
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:30.300]   The kickoff of Ad Age Digital and Samsung Galaxy S4 pre-orders start on AT&T.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:33.420]   Wednesday, April 17th, it's a big earnings day as well.
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:35.540]   eBay has their earnings day.
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:41.860]   Also demo mobile kicks off and it's the anniversary of the first proposal of FTP in 1971.
[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:48.620]   Thursday, April 18th, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Verizon and Nokia all have their earnings.
[01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:53.340]   And Friday, April 19th, the HTC One for AT&T is scheduled to ship.
[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:54.340]   Let's look at the week ahead.
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:55.340]   See you, Liam.
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:56.340]   That's my new phone.
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:57.340]   I can't wait to get that HTC One.
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:52:58.340]   How many phones do you have?
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:52:59.340]   God, no.
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.340]   Well, I trade them in, but...
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:01.340]   Oh, Gazelle.
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:08.620]   The Note 2 I loved, but now this is 1920 by 1080 and a 4.7 inch screen.
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:09.620]   And people have seen it.
[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:10.620]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.620]   It's unbelievable.
[01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:12.620]   Unbelievable.
[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:13.620]   The HTC One.
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:14.620]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:17.980]   And it's good for watching YouTube videos because it's got speakers in the front, left
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:18.980]   and right.
[01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:19.980]   You can sit there like this.
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:20.980]   Yeah, those speakers.
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:21.980]   I might get a Note 2.
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:22.980]   I like the Note 2.
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:23.980]   I like the size.
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:24.980]   I like the Note 2.
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:26.980]   It's been a great phone.
[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:27.980]   You know what I did?
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:28.980]   My mom's visiting.
[01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:29.980]   She's 80 years old.
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:31.740]   And she had a bad feature phone.
[01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:34.140]   And I said, "Mom, you've got to have a smartphone.
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.420]   I'm going to do a trial with you."
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:38.820]   iPhone 5, Note 2, one week with each.
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:39.820]   It wasn't even a contest.
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:40.820]   Note 2.
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:41.820]   It's easier to see.
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:42.820]   She draws.
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:43.820]   It's easier to see.
[01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:44.820]   She's drawing with a stylus.
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:45.820]   She loves it.
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:47.220]   I was a little worried because Android is not easy to use.
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:49.180]   And she has an iPad, so she knows how to use the iPhone.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:53.760]   And once you root Android or most Android phones or you get an access, get rid of a lot
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:56.460]   of the detritus that normally comes from the manufacturer.
[01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:57.460]   That's the next thing.
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:58.460]   Mom and I are going to sit down.
[01:53:58.460 --> 01:53:59.460]   We're going to do a little class on rooting your phone.
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:00.460]   So, it'll be fun.
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:01.460]   Thank you, John.
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:02.460]   Thank you, Roger.
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:03.460]   Thank you, Lamar.
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:04.460]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:05.460]   We'll see you next time on Another Twin.
