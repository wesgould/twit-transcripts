[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520]   Joining us now, Windows experts.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520]   All around the table starting with Paul Thorot.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   He's the host of Windows Weekly on the Twit Network

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.520]   and the author of Windows Vista Secrets,
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   which is now completely obsolete.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   Hi, Paul.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.520]   Yes, exactly.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   Throw it out.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   I'm so proud.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   Paul has brought with him some of his expert Windows friends,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.520]   including Ed Bot, ZDNet Blogger,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520]   and the longtime Windows expert
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   former editor of PC World magazine.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   Is that PC World, right, Ed?
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   That's right.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520]   Yeah, I got it right.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   And PC World, PC computing,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   you know, all the magazines that are now much smaller
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520]   or don't exist at all.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   PC computing was the first to die, wasn't it?
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   Yes.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520]   That's sad.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   I loved PC computing.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   I always thought that was a great magazine.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   So did I.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   Yeah, I bet you did.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   You were the founding editor.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.520]   I was there the second year.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520]   Second year, okay.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.520]   Yep.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.520]   And always a good friend.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   I've known Ed since we started doing Radio John C. de Vorac
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   and I started doing radio back in the turn of the day.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   Yeah, in the turn of the century.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   Back when we were young.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   Back when we were young.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   And also with us a new friend that I'm looking forward to getting
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520]   now better, Raphael Rivera Jr.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   He is a ZD also a columnist, a blogger and the future co-author
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   of Windows 7 Secrets.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   And his blog within windows.com is very, very popular.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   Raphael, nice to meet you.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520]   Nice to meet you, Leo.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.520]   So also, I've been weird.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   I'm the newbie here.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   Nah.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   No, don't feel weird.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   Is there something like first day prank we can pull on him or something?
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520]   This is it.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   Are you kidding?
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520]   This is the prank.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520]   Yeah, this is.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.520]   Sorry.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   Yeah, this is pretty much where the careers go to die.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   You don't get prankier than this.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   I'll tell you right now.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.520]   You've been punked, Raphael.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   You're on to it.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   Ha ha.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.520]   So you all were in Los Angeles for the professional developers
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   conference.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   Yes.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   Yes.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   How many PDCs is this Ed bot?
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   Wow.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.520]   Well, I remember I think my first one was in 1992.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   Wow.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   So that's before there even was a Windows.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   Ed, you're really old.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.520]   And going to this most recent one reminded me of that.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   Oh, man.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.520]   No, they don't have them every year though.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.520]   They don't have them every year.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.520]   I went to, you know, so that was one for.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   That was one for Windows NT for the first release of Windows NT.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.520]   And then there was one in 94.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.520]   That was the big Q basic PDC, right?
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520]   Oh, that was exciting.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   For Chicago.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.520]   Oh, Chicago.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.520]   For Chicago.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.520]   AKA Windows 95.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   Yep.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.520]   It was one for .NET.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520]   I believe in Denver.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   Remember the, um, the .NET PDC?
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   You know, I skipped that one.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   Everyone did.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.520]   There's only much more to anyone than person.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   I was trapped in a hail storm.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   Sure.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   There you go.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520]   That's his experience.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   Everything came up blue though.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.520]   It's okay.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   Geek humor.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.520]   So in general, Microsoft does PDC win.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.520]   Why?
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.520]   Well, when there's a new platform, right?
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.520]   Yeah, with a generally with, you know, roughly a year or so before they expect to launch a new
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   platform.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.520]   And everyone's in a while.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.520]   2003.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   That doesn't work quite as well.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   That would be the last PDC, which was a Vista PDC.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   Now it was a long horn.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   Long horn.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.520]   It was long horn.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   That was the next year by the great long horn reset.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520]   Yes.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.520]   Which they did instead of shipping the product.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   They say everything we told you last year was wrong.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   Actually, they kind of did.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   Please forget.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.520]   Over, over several months.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   They, you know, they couldn't say it in a single sentence or a single release.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.800]   It took about six to nine months for them to fess up to the, the, all the details of the
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.440]   great long horn reset.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.520]   So look, look at all the great technologies we're still using from that PDC.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   Like, hmm.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   Oh, shoot.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   Well, moving along.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   So Raphael, how many PDCs have you been to?
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.520]   I would say two.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   Okay.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   You're the youngster here.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   Unfortunately.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   The newbie.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   Were you impressed?
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   Was this an interesting event?
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   It was very interesting.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.760]   Now we all kind of knew the cloud platform would be unveiled and that would be thoroughly
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   confused.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.520]   We thought it would be strata, but instead it's Azure.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   Right.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   Right.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.520]   Or Azure or Azul, Azurio or whatever that.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.520]   I'm a sailor.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   The task bar was awesome.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   The what?
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.040]   The unveiling of the task bar was awesome.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   Really?
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   From Windows 7, you know.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.920]   Is that like a big, that's like the big deal is the task bar?
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.520]   And that's, I know it sounds silly, but it is kind of a big deal.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.040]   So what's new about the task bar?
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's, it's classy and shiny and stuff.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.280]   Let's, let's take a step back.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.520]   Before we talk about individual features, Microsoft announced basically two big things,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   Windows 7, which by the way is not a code name.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.520]   This is going to be the name.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.760]   That's the real deal.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.600]   This ain't no Longhorn Chicago thing.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Yes.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.280]   Windows version 6.1 will be called Windows 7.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.520]   You know, in the world of Microsoft, that actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   All right.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   All right.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.640]   Talk to a little bit about this on Windows weekly.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.400]   And I've been ever since like I'll go to sleep.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.360]   It's by the way, a great way, better than counting sheep.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.880]   Go to sleep trying to count the versions of windows trying to get to 7 with a next one.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   And you can't.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.480]   Can't, can't do it.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.560]   Somebody sent me an email saying, well, oh please, I've got a thousand emails.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.720]   This is how you do it.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.640]   I figured here's the key.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.240]   You know, no, no, it's not the seventh version of anything.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.800]   It's so stop trying.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.680]   If you start with NT, the NT kernel, you could start with Cubasic.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.880]   It's not the seventh version of anything.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   It's okay.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.680]   All they had to say was, sorry.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.560]   I think actually if you start with each family and then you name it and then you take a shot.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.920]   Yes, yes.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.160]   Somewhere in between six and seven, it makes perfect sense.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   Exactly.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.840]   That's exactly what we actually tried that at PDC.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.880]   I believe we did that live.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.400]   Four nights in a row, actually.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   It's just part of the problem.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   Everybody's a little bit tired.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.320]   Well, we're all tired, but we're also very accepting of the name now.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   You might notice that.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   That's true.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.920]   You know, after a while, just all starts to make sense.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.840]   You know, it's like when you name a baby, you name your baby Frots.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.000]   At first it seems odd, but after a few years, Frots is just completely normal and that's
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   just what you call them.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Hey, Frots, come here Frots.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Nice boy Frots.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.560]   It's like the Pentium name.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.760]   Remember until I announced that name and everyone was like Pentium.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   What the?
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   It sounded like a dent of Frots.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   It didn't.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.160]   It made up word.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.560]   But now Pentium is just the way it is.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.560]   Right.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.960]   They might have asked the Palin family for names.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.760]   Well, Windows truck.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.160]   Well, like I said, they could call it yogurt for all I care.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.080]   I mean, it's a fine operating system regardless.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   All right.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.560]   So those are the two things we'll talk about today as Azure and Windows 7.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.960]   Characterize for me, if you will.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.640]   Maybe I'll let Paul do this.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   What?
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.480]   The Windows 7 different than or the same as Vista.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.080]   Where does it fit into the family?
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.840]   In 150 words or less?
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.360]   Yes, exactly.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   I would say from a technical perspective, Windows 7 is the next version of Windows Vista.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.920]   You know, it's an evolution technologically, right?
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.280]   From a user experience standpoint, if I could use Microsoft lingo for a while.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.600]   Also an evolution, I guess.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.280]   But I think they're describing it as a big release because there's a bunch of fun new
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.800]   stuff in the UI that makes it hopefully more useful but certainly more fun to use.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.000]   So it's more colorful.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.680]   It's got more of the effects going on.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.400]   It's a cooler looking thing.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.320]   And in many ways, sort of like an Apple product.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.480]   It's big on the shiny button stuff.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   So would you--
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.760]   The way I would add on to that, when people have been asking me about it, and I've described
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:04.560]   it as, this is Microsoft started at the very lowest levels with Vista and went all the
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.760]   way to the user interface and really appeared to have looked at everything along the way
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:18.120]   and said, how can we refine this, make it better, make it simpler, you know, remove the
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.760]   annoyances--most of the annoyances, obviously not all of them.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.240]   It'll still be Windows.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.400]   But they've really simplified things.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:34.880]   But not just at the UI level and not just at the driver and API level, but sort of in
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.120]   a continuum from one to the other.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.120]   Yeah, I agree with that 100%.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:45.000]   It doesn't seem like there's any little piece of Windows that hasn't been given the ones
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   over.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.240]   I think all of it got a spit shine.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.440]   And some of the stuff they did as we alluded to earlier is fun.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.920]   I mean, it's some pretty cool stuff in there.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:02.480]   Rafael, you like that I see that 50% of your blog readers prefer Windows 7 and then 50%
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.480]   prefer Windows 7.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:12.240]   Yeah, that was a blog post I made when the name was confirmed to be final.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.400]   No, what's the ever--you know, the margin of error there is a plus or minus 7.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   50%.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.880]   It's the red versus the blue.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.400]   I like that.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.920]   So Rafael, do you consider this as some do just kind of a polishing of Windows Vista,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.280]   kind of Windows Vista the way it should have been or is it really a new version, all new
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.080]   version?
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.440]   Like Paul would say, this is Vista done right.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.880]   You guys all got a copy of it, right?
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.880]   Yes, yes.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:55.240]   At FPC, we attended a workshop and we got some laptops preloaded with Windows 7.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.920]   And then on top of that, received the bits along with all the other attendees.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.760]   So you have a disk, a laptop and a hard drive.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   And a hard drive.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.920]   What was on the hard drive, Ed?
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:17.720]   Well, it's the installation media plus a bunch of other stuff, some SDKs, white papers,
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   some tools.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.600]   So it's like the full press kit.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.120]   Yeah, it's the stuff, you know, in the Longhorn timeframe, as they say, this would have been
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.600]   done in, you know, it would have been a stack of three or four or five DVDs.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.520]   But I think they got to the point where they added it all up and said, this would have
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.720]   been 15 or 16 DVDs.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   Just put it on a--
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.840]   Oh, by the way, it wasn't full of which is kind of confused.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.400]   They were talking about 160 gigs of stuff, you know, but the thing is only like half full.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.160]   I mean, it's maybe 75 or 80 gigs of stuff.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.160]   I forget how it works.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.240]   So you've all been using Windows 7 now for a few days.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.720]   Are you using-- are you all using it, Rafael?
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.840]   Are you using it as kind of your production machine or is it one in the corner?
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840]   You are--
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   That's not--
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.840]   Really?
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   It's usable.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.840]   It's stable.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   Especially the 64-bit version.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   Now, okay, that's-- so there's a 32-bit and a 64-bit version still?
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.840]   Yeah, in my experience, the 32-bit version, the Explorer freezes a lot for some reason.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.640]   And it's true on a variety of machines.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:25.440]   So I found that the 64-bit version, for whatever reason, appears to be even a little more stable.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.640]   But it's-- you know, I think for people like us, it's pretty much there for day-to-day
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   use.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.200]   It's not-- obviously, it's not ship-ready or anything.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.120]   I wouldn't have my parents run it.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.000]   Are there significant features missing?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Yes.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Yes.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Okay.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.240]   Well, like that awesome taskbar that Raphael was--
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.240]   Oh, it's not there?
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240]   Right.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.280]   Although he has a surprise about that this evening.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   You do, Raphael?
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.280]   What's your surprise?
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.520]   Maybe this is a good time for that.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.520]   Surprise.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   Oh.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.320]   He scared us out.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.200]   So at PDC, everyone was running around.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.120]   They're like, hey, Raphael, I heard from A, B, and C that if you hold up your laptop
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.240]   to the moon, stand on one foot, connect to the Microsoft domain, the taskbar will appear.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.440]   Of course, that didn't sound very true, so I ignored it.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:23.360]   But this morning, I woke up, started digging through stuff, trying to find some arrow shake
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.320]   references, totally independent of this.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.640]   But I stumbled upon code that checks to see if your machine is a part of a select few
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.200]   domains at Microsoft.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:46.360]   And checks to see if you are a user that does not have the letters A- or V- and then after
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.080]   all, after you meet all this criteria, the taskbar appears.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   How-- what?
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.080]   And it's--
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.280]   So this is the Blue Badge test.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.280]   Yes, that's exactly right.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.120]   What's the Blue Badge test?
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.520]   Well, at Microsoft--
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.320]   Yeah, yeah, full-time employees at Microsoft have a Blue Badge.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:11.240]   Benders and consultants have, as Raphael alluded to there, they have an A- or a V- in
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.360]   front of their name, and they get a different color badge.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.880]   So are you all using this new, beautiful taskbar now that you know how to do it?
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.240]   No, because Raphael hasn't shared this with us yet.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   You will.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   You will.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.600]   I was literally scrambling to get this all typed up into a live writer and ready to post.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.360]   Press the button, press the button, press the button.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.160]   I will push the button right now.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.800]   What's exciting, exciting, go to withinwindows.com.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   Everybody do that right now.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.640]   We'll bring the site to its knees.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.640]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   And so you're going to post-- do you have some screenshots of it?
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.920]   I have a screenshot.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.160]   I have a flow chart explaining how this process works.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160]   I'd actually do it.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.160]   OK.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   Yes.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.600]   Now, can civilians get copies of this beta of Windows 7 or how do you--
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.720]   It's not designed-- they didn't release it that way, but of course, it's not protected
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   in any fashion.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.000]   So I would imagine it's already out there.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   So yeah, sure.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Especially-- OK.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.080]   So the version that you guys got on a disk, on a CD or DVD, could just be distributed.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.440]   It's probably on the-- somebody must have put it up now on the spit torrents, right?
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   Absolutely.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.920]   It's got to be all over the place, I know.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.680]   How shall we recognize it?
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.480]   How shall we know it's the real thing?
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   What's the build number?
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   Is there some--
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.120]   Oh, oh, I see.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.120]   6801?
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.120]   OK.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.880]   So this is build 6801.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   And I'm sure there are now right now spyware and pirates putting copies of something up
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.080]   on the torrents with that build number.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.920]   So be careful, of course.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.480]   So tell us-- we're going to-- we got an hour.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.960]   We're not even that long.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   45 minutes.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.680]   Tell me some stuff that's going to get me drooling over Windows 7.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.720]   Tell me why I should care.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.600]   Actually the real question-- and this is-- after reading everybody's reviews of this over the
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.120]   last few days, my real question is, why would anybody buy-- especially a business that hasn't
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.880]   upgraded to Vista, why would they buy Vista at this point?
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.880]   Exactly.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   That's--
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.520]   Well, I think there's-- I think there's an answer to that.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.640]   I mean, because it is-- it's been around for a couple of years.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:31.920]   It's-- if a business has been qualifying its internal apps against Vista--
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.760]   Yeah, you've done all this work so far, might as well benefit.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:41.760]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know many consumers who would want to use Windows 2000 in preference
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.400]   to Windows XP at this point.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.480]   And yet there are lots of businesses that say, no, we're sticking with Windows 2000.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480]   Right.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.600]   Well, there are lots of consumers anecdotally that are sticking with Windows XP.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.600]   Yeah?
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.080]   I guess if you buy a new computer, you're going to get Vista on it.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.640]   Did they say-- did they say when Windows 7 would come out?
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.640]   No.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.600]   The general-- what I've been seeing is, you know, August 2009.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.160]   Is that unreasonable?
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.280]   No, I think-- I think that's very reasonable.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.480]   In fact, I think that is their plan.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.960]   I think they want to ship this earlier than people believe they're capable of doing.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.400]   They would be foolish to say when, because of course that really would kind of kill sales
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   on Vista.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.240]   Because-- well, plus then what happens if it doesn't work out?
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.240]   Right.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240]   You know, then it looks like Longhorn again.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.000]   Not that they've ever missed a ship schedule or anything.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.560]   No, not Microsoft.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.520]   So you've said before, Paul, that because it's so componentized, you think they can ship
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.560]   it any time, basically.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   Absolutely.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.520]   And they pretty much verified that.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:52.000]   They talked about how anything that's in the build is ready to go and in a near, you know,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.560]   final state of such quality that they could include it in there.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.080]   It wasn't like in the Longhorn days where they would just throw stuff in there.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   And depending on which component you were talking about, it was either nearly done or
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   not even close.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:08.120]   You know, most of the stuff that's in there is, you know, pretty baked.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.520]   So yeah, they could artificially at some point in June or July or August or whatever, just
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.320]   draw the line and say, "Hey, we're done."
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.480]   And whatever's ready is ready, and that's what we're shipping.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.280]   And I'm sure they'd love to do something like that.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.000]   I mean, I think obviously they're going to have to have a schedule.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.680]   And at some point they'll have to announce what that schedule is.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.480]   I noticed that the evaluation copy you guys got expires July 1st, 2000, not sure.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.320]   Well, I don't think that means anything.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   That's me.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.640]   They're going to have a beta release.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.400]   They'll have a release candidate.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   Right.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.680]   They've already said that the beta would be available early next year.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   Wow.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.400]   That's the official phrase that they used was early next year.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.280]   Does this feel like an alpha or a pre-release?
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.520]   This feels like a beta 2.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520]   It really does.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.520]   Wow.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.720]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   Why is that, Ralph?
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.760]   Why is it so solid?
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.400]   Is this something, some new magic process Microsoft's using?
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.240]   That's magic.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.640]   I mean, really, seriously, if it was that easy, why don't they do it before?
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.160]   Well, it's different people, I think, are responsible for this.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.960]   And this is their credo.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.880]   Stephen Snafsky said in our reviewers' workshop, and I think he might have said during the
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.880]   keynote, I'm not sure.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:28.040]   But they don't want to over-promise and undeliver, obviously, but they also don't want to under-promise
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   and over-deliver.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.440]   I mean, that's the sign of a very similar problem, right?
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.640]   Why not under-promise and over-deliver?
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.800]   No, they want to, what they said, which I think is actually, I don't want to say it's
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.240]   profound, but I actually appreciated the way you said it.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   We want to promise, and then we want to deliver what we promised.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240]   Wow.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   And that's what we want to do.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.240]   What a concept.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:52.440]   Yeah, but this thing being solid is an indication of what we were just talking about, that
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.480]   they're not going to put stuff into that build until it's ready.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.200]   I mean, the beta one version of Longhorn was a joke.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   It was terrible.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   The PDC 2003 release that we got after that awesome demo was horribly painful because
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.720]   it was nothing like that thing that directed demo.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.040]   They showed up on the screen, which was so beautiful and so wonderful.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.520]   It looked nothing like that.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.680]   It was terrible.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:22.200]   And that's the type of thing they knew they need to work on.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.000]   And clearly, the results of that have occurred.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.560]   Stirkerius is saying in our chatroom that maybe it's just a stripped-down vista.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.160]   I mean, is that it?
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.040]   I mean, is it just- Absolutely not.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.520]   Absolutely not.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   What?
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   Why not?
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:45.760]   Well, I can tell you that, but all you have to do is sit down and use it for an hour and
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.680]   you'll see for yourself what I'm talking about.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:58.120]   I mean, each there's the sort of level of attention of detail that has gone into the
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   changes.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.320]   I mean, if it were a stripped-down version of Vista, you'd go through and you'd go unchanged,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.320]   unchanged, unchanged.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   Whoa, they really worked on this part.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.320]   Right.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.560]   Well, or look, here's the bunch of stuff they removed that by removing this thing, it actually
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.760]   made the system faster or smaller.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   There isn't that kind of stuff.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.720]   There are, in fact, additions.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.040]   Things like the library system, which is basically that thing they wanted to do along or done
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.680]   right, not done with WinFS, but done and actually working.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   And it does work.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:34.160]   But like Ed was saying earlier, there are so many small changes and improvements that
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.640]   it's not that stuff has been taken away.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.920]   It's just been finally honed.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.000]   They've really done a nice job with it.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.640]   It sounds like a little bit of an indictment, frankly, of the Vista team.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.000]   Like these guys screwed up.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Yep.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.440]   Well, that's one way, that definitely is one way to look at it.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.720]   But I think you can also, and there's a lot of that in there.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.360]   There was a poorly run project all down the line.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:08.760]   But what they did with Vista was a whole bunch of architectural work.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:14.960]   I mean, it was 90% architectural and 10% UI.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:23.360]   And it was like nobody was really thinking through, from an engineering point of view,
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.080]   the UI part of it.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   So that's interesting.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.160]   So they're benefiting from the underlying infrastructure that the Vista team put in.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.640]   They're using that.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.040]   And they're now just doing a new interface on top of it that benefits from the work done
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:42.200]   and throws out that kind of lame work that was done kind of hastily at the last moment.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Oh, well, finishes.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.160]   I don't think it would be fair to say it was done hastily at the last moment.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.480]   But they didn't put the resources into it from day one that they did.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.920]   So Vista was a platform release.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.480]   I think I agree with that.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.600]   But I guess I would just expand on it.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   I just remind everybody that the Longhorn project that they showed up in 2003 was not
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.080]   Vista that came out later.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:13.280]   Vista, like I had said, was the subject of a reboot or reset of what they were doing
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.440]   with Windows at the time.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.120]   And Vista itself, if you wanted to look at that project, really came to market in about
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.320]   two years.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.040]   And it was a major architectural change that enabled both what they're doing today.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.160]   But also, you know, the sort of thing where you have a desktop and you have a start button
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.960]   and a taskbar and it works just like Windows has always worked.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.920]   It sort of hides or masks, you know, the degree of the changes that occurred under the covers.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.720]   So it's like we still have a Chevy body.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.920]   Maybe we got a fins, but the engine, the drive train, the transmission, all of that's been
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   re-architected.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   Right.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.600]   And that's a hard thing to communicate to people because they use it and they say, well, you
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.320]   know, it kind of works like Windows XP.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.800]   I don't quite see what the big...
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.440]   If they did the job right, it would.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.680]   You wouldn't say, oh, this is all different.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   Well, what about...
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.680]   Is it still NTFS?
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.720]   We're not going to WinFS any time soon.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   No.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.280]   So it's still NTFS.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   It is.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.280]   Is that a capitulation?
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:13.800]   I mean, that was one of the big things of the Longhorn project was this Windows file system.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   Not at all.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   Not at all.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   Why not?
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.400]   Actually, WinFS stood for, I think, Windows Future Storage.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.600]   Oh, sorry.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.920]   And it wasn't a file system.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:35.240]   It was a series of technologies, schemas, and database organizational plumbing that worked
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.280]   in conjunction with the file system.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.880]   So it was always designed to be sort of pluggable on top of NTFS.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.440]   And a lot of that stuff has now appeared in different formats and things.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:52.600]   I think there's a bunch of stuff in SQL Server 2005 R2 or something like that that's direct
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.840]   descendant of WinFS.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:05.520]   But you look at NTFS with Windows Search on top of it and some of the other goodies that
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.320]   they've got in pretty slick and pretty fast.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.400]   Microsoft has said a few years ago, we can do what we want to do in the file system without
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.640]   WinFS.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.760]   And that was true of VIST-It's even more true of Windows 7.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.000]   You can see it happening.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Is the registry still there?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Oh, God, I hope so.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.400]   Yeah, it's got to be there.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.040]   I will look.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.200]   But of course it is.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.360]   It's so backwards compatible, how could it not be?
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.760]   Yeah, well, we make one.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.280]   We used to use Win.ini.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.720]   I mean, you can.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.320]   You can presumably move to the next generation at some point.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   How do you all feel?
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:50.080]   Do you feel like the registry is something that you want to see there or Raphael?
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   Are you a fan of the registry?
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:59.400]   I think we all love to hate the registry, but if you try to re-engineer a solution, you
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.440]   end up with the registry all over again.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:13.320]   Yeah, I mean, for compatibility's sake, if you tried to remove the registry, first of
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.840]   all, you'd be doing it for an artificial reason.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.600]   And second thing, you would break compatibility with everything.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.880]   You would ultimately have to build something 10 times as complicated as the registry to
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.480]   make the new stuff compatible with the registry.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.800]   If the registry did not exist, we would have had to invent it.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:40.400]   Well, and so, you know, just to spin into the future, the way you're finally going to
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:47.440]   get rid of it is to have a new operating system with a virtualization layer inside of it that
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:54.860]   runs old, you know, current Windows-style applications within it with a registry virtualized
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:28:01.520]   inside of that thing, which is what, you know, Apple did when they went from OS9 to OS10.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:07.760]   They had that compatibility box that served them for a while, but they had, you know,
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.680]   1,000th of the number of Windows programs running and one 1 millionth of the number
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.720]   of mission critical enterprise level programs running.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.840]   So it was, you know, it was painful for them.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.800]   And yet, you know, it was painful for them to do, but they were able to pull it off in
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   a couple of years.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.360]   So you're saying there's no reason to dump the registry.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.440]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.480]   And there's a strong reason not to keep it for compatibility purposes.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.160]   It's a strong reason to keep it for compatibility purposes.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.360]   And no reason to get rid of it.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.040]   No, no real reason to get rid of it.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.360]   You know, you can harden it.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:47.200]   You can make it easier to recover from damage to it to back it up and restore it.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.040]   And that's what some of the robustness features that are in Windows 7 are there, you know,
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:29:00.240]   too, you know, precisely to just make the, make the registry work around some of the
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.560]   brittleness of the registry, I suppose.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.840]   Now, I notice it is lighter weight in the sense that you could run it on a smaller computer.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.280]   Paul was telling me Steve Sonofsky is running on a netbook with a gig of RAM.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.800]   And they have 12.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   512.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   Is that right?
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   512.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   I don't know.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.360]   I think he had one gig of RAM in a 10-bit.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   Okay.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.040]   Let's not go crazy here.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.080]   But still a gig is impressive.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.440]   How do you make, how do you, I mean, it's, if it's Vista under the hood, how do you
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.560]   make it run on a gig with an atom processor?
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.480]   And I mean, how do you do that?
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:46.600]   I know people who have Vista running on those systems with, with more than acceptable performance.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   Okay.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:53.520]   Well, I have a, I do have a, a, an ultra mobile PC that I want to say has a gig of RAM and
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:58.960]   maybe 512, but in a very slow processor, whatever it is, and Vista was completely unacceptable
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   on that system.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.440]   And you're reminding me now.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   I should install it.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.600]   And yes, you have to.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.240]   So is the kernel changed at all?
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.640]   Are we still seeing the same, essentially the same kernel or is that rewritten as well?
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.640]   How would you know?
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   I don't know.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.080]   I mean, that's your experts.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   I don't know.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.120]   This is a, this is a touchy subject for the windows guys.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.600]   Why is it touchy?
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.080]   Because people like to equate new versions of things with new kernels.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   I want a new kernel.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   The kernel is, is being involved.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.080]   That's how Linux does it.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.200]   New, new version Linux means a new kernel, basically.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   It's version 6.1.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   It's yet it's kernel, kernel 6.1.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.880]   The seventh, it's the, it's the seventh version of the kernel.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   I know that.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.280]   So, you know, we've got that going for us.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.480]   And by the way, that it expires on seven, one, two thousand, not coincidental.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:55.960]   I don't think you can actually if you slice the kernel sideways and count the number of
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   rings in it.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   All right.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   There are seven.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   All right.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.080]   I'll drop my question in the healthy center of the operating system.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.440]   Again, I mentioned it.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.920]   Actually, the kernel there have been one of the things that, that, you know, that Sinopsky
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.400]   talked about in his, in his various remarks.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   And when he and I talked about it in the, in the brief time that we had to talk one
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:26.760]   on one, he says they, they did go in and they looked at a lot of the low level code in the
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:33.320]   kernel saying, is there, you know, is, is there an instruction or a semaphore or a,
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:40.800]   you know, or some place where it touches the, the BIOS here where we can identify, you know,
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.520]   a clock cycle or two or 10 that we can remove to make it faster.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.480]   And each time you do one of those things, it's, it's unnoticeable.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:54.640]   But if you can do that a hundred or a thousand times, then it's the sort of thing that you
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   just feel.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.640]   Yes.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.520]   So maybe that's where some of the performance improvement came.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.000]   Oh, I get there's no doubt about it.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.240]   And I think that's what I was alluding to when I said they've started at the lowest
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.720]   level and worked all the way up to the parts that you see on the desktop.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.160]   And since that level of, of attention to detail, it kind of makes sense.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.760]   I mean, we were at a mature, it's a mature operating system.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.360]   Vista was, you know, kind of a rewrite.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.840]   The next step is to clean it up, tie it up, speed it up.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.840]   That's what you would do.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   That's where you would go.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:31.720]   And you do that probably before you'd start tagging on some really big new features.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.680]   So what you're saying that the platform release was Vista.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.120]   This is the tune up release.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:45.080]   That's probably a fair way to, to put it a, a, a pretty major tune up.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:52.360]   I mean, there's a lot of re tooling, you know, there's, there's a lot of, you know, there's
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:57.600]   a lot of engineering to tighter tolerances and, and, and, and so on.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.520]   But now we're also seeing a new UI, but is that just kind of de rigour?
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.040]   If you're going to release a new version of Windows, people won't think of it as a new
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.400]   version unless the start button is translucent or something new.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.640]   I mean, yeah, it's painting the pig.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.680]   It's painting the, whatever.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.680]   That's a nice phrase.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.120]   Hey, that came from Steven Sanovski.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.120]   Really?
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.680]   But I mean, obviously you have to do that.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.040]   Otherwise customers just don't know the difference.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   Right.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.320]   But it's not just, but not just doing it, doing it sick.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   Right.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   They're not just painting the pig this kid.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   They're not just right.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.800]   In other words, they're not just doing it to do it.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   Look, hey, it's flashy and new.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.200]   I mean, like Ed was saying, they, they looked at every little piece of the OS, not just
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.080]   the stuff you see, but also one of the covers and said, how can we make this better?
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.320]   How can we make this more efficient?
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.120]   How can we make it work more simply?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.800]   And that comes through when it goes.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.720]   I'm looking at Raphael's beautiful new taskbar.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   Well, okay.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.240]   So it's transparent.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.800]   But you're looking at a screenshot.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.000]   You were looking at a static screenshot.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.280]   And so what that doesn't show you is that on that screen, so if you, so let's, let's
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.680]   imagine that you have a browser with five tabs open and you have a copy of Outlook with
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:12.560]   five message windows open and you have a, you know, and you have a word with five documents
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.560]   open, right?
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.320]   Right now to switch between those, you would use, you would use the taskbar to find the
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.080]   window that you want.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.240]   And then you would click on the taskbar icon, which might be grouped.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.400]   And then you would switch to that.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.600]   And if you wanted to open a new program, you would go to the desktop or the start menu
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:37.400]   or the quick launch bar or, or some third party launcher program that you had.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.960]   And, and all of those things would be, you know, a multiple clicks in multiple different
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.520]   places to get them there, right?
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:50.640]   So what they've done with what they're calling the super bar here is to combine all of the
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:59.880]   all of the launching and switching features into a single, highly visual, highly efficient
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.880]   process.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   You like it.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.800]   I think, I, well, I like what I saw of it.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.200]   I haven't, I haven't been able to download raw fails files so that I can make it work
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   here yet.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.040]   But, you know, I like, I like what I saw that there's a, there's a lot that's rational
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   to it.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.560]   And there's a lot of analogs to it in other things that I've seen where things that used
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.440]   to take five clicks take two.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:27.520]   Is it kind of a, I always tend like doc interface?
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   More than.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   Okay.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:35.120]   Because I've been using the OS 10 doc lately just to, to sort of prepare myself for that.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:43.800]   OS 10 uses the doc both as a launcher and as a way to give you a little status indicator,
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.440]   the glowing thing underneath that tells you that thing is running.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:52.040]   And it also gives you a, a menu of things where you can switch to, to things that are
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.640]   running from there.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:02.560]   The, the Windows seven version adds a whole visual dimension to it and also a, a sort
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.080]   of non procedural dimension to it.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:14.200]   So you put the mouse over that Internet Explorer icon and previews of live previews, not just
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:19.080]   static snapshots, but live previews of the five tabs that you have open show up there.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:23.720]   And you move the mouse over one of those and it appears in a window on the screen, move
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.200]   the mouse away and the window goes away.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.520]   So the preview becomes the window.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.720]   And then if you click on it, then, then you switch to it.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.040]   If you move away from it, you don't switch to it.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:41.440]   So it's all very fluid and, and you know, with the, with the doc or with, or with the
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.080]   taskbar and windows, you want to switch to something you, you have to, you sort of, you
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.280]   sort of see it there and then you click on it and you go to it.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.440]   And if it wasn't the one that you wanted, well, there you are, you've got to go back
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.440]   to the doc or the taskbar.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.520]   This gives you an intermediate way to check that you're looking at the right thing.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.520]   Yep.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.640]   Raphael, it looks like this, this little hack you do.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:08.160]   You did is, is Microsoft gonna get mad at you?
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.080]   I, you know, I'm not sure what they can do.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:19.560]   I've made sure I've included no copyrighted code in my little tool.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.320]   I guess we'll see.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   They could change it.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.080]   I mean, they could change it to, you know, tomorrow, make it dash z or something that
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   you need to have in there.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   Well, no.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:37.840]   Well, yes and no, but I, you know, I am totally in awe of what Raphael has done here.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.360]   And you know, and I'm going to be, you know, I'm going to be trying this myself.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.120]   Having said that, it is important to point out that the build 6801 build that we have
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.720]   here was finalized on September 13th.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:59.200]   And it represents a version of the interface that was probably, you know, the UI portion
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.000]   of it was probably locked down several weeks before that.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.280]   So the builds that they were showing at PDC, you know, the things that are in the keynote
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.040]   demos and in the individual demos that we saw would have been at least a month more
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.120]   current than that.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.040]   And they've been doing a lot of work on that.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:22.680]   So even even unlocking things, you know, as Raphael has done is not necessarily going
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.480]   to give you the experience that you saw in the keynotes.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   Right.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.240]   Not absolutely Ed.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.060]   And what I've noticed here on my 7 laptop is that, for example, the quick launch tool
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.760]   bar still, it's still there.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.000]   They made it quite clear.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.800]   It's right with that.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.200]   Arrow peak where you drag your mouse to the corner and all the windows become translucent.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.760]   You can see to your desktop.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.720]   That doesn't seem to work at all.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.120]   There are various little things here and there that are missing.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.880]   Although, by the way, the code for that is sort of there.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.280]   If you right click on that little square, it gives you the two options.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.960]   So preview desktop, which would be the arrow peak feature, and then show desktop, which
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.360]   is the old behavior and the one that works in the current build, you know, in the regular
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.360]   UI.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.360]   So you can see how they were sort of on the way to doing it.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   Yep.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.640]   But that you, yeah, you don't get the effect unfortunately because the arrow peak effect
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.720]   is actually pretty cool as well.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.560]   Arrow is still there, but now enhanced with some new features.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560]   Is that it?
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.400]   Anything else, we're going to wrap it up because I want to get to the cloud portion
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.040]   too, which I think is isn't important, if not more important.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.200]   Anything else you guys want to say about Windows 7?
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.600]   I think we should speak about the most important thing that's in Windows, which is of course
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   the gadgets.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.560]   All the sidebar isn't on the side anymore.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.360]   It's everywhere.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   Everywhere baby.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.960]   Everywhere you want to be.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.120]   That's kind of mackish too, but okay.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.120]   Okay.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.640]   Well, which is kind of I never liked the sidebar because I don't like having them all there,
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.840]   but you could drag stuff out of the sidebar before.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.880]   You could actually say that this makes the desktop active.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.120]   Oh, no.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.880]   I'm making the sign of the cross right now.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.600]   Oh, it is it, you know, the active desktop.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:16.160]   I mean, this is come to, well, this is really come to fruition and done right.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:23.520]   I mean, that was, you know, the Windows 7 version of gadgets is too active desktop.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:29.600]   What, you know, Arrow is to the Windows 2.1 program manager.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   Right.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.600]   Right.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.600]   Right.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   No, it looks cool.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.800]   And there are now, you know, we've talked before about this, Paul, that there aren't as
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.840]   many gadgets as one would hope.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.040]   Maybe they can do something to encourage more gadgetry.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.040]   Oh, geez.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.560]   It can only be better than it is now.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.760]   I mean, the problem is the number of gadgets.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.360]   It's the quality of the gadgets.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.800]   And I'm actually interested that they're continuing with this in Windows 7 because frankly, very
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.440]   few of the gadgets that appeared in the Windows Vista timeframe so far have been compelling
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.800]   in any way.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:03.640]   You know, I mean, the only one I downloaded from a third party was a like a resource monitor
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.280]   type of thing, you know, which is really kind of lame.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:11.320]   Well, I'll have to write this up this week because I've got a half a dozen awesome gadgets
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.160]   here, all third parties.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.280]   Oh, you should, you should because.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.640]   Well, you know, and it's not hard to write gadgets.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.320]   It's a fairly easy thing to do.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.600]   I would like, I would imagine that there'll be something you could cultivate and get people
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.320]   to write more of.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:31.560]   And the collection is in Windows 7 is unchanged from Windows Vista, which makes me think that
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.040]   that's one of the things.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:40.080]   They're going to unveil a whole bunch of real, you know, I would expect them to do some awesome
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.880]   ones in there and save them for the very, very last minute.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.640]   And where are all the Windows Live ones, right?
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.320]   Why isn't there some crazy collection of Windows Live?
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.960]   Ah, well, let's get live in just a little bit.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.000]   I want to talk about the cloud.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.160]   I guess a couple more things.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.480]   Real quickly about 7.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.960]   Gaming, still direct X.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   It's not going to change it.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:04.720]   Gaming, it'll be if it's lighter weight, maybe it'll even be better for gaming.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.720]   No comment.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.720]   No.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   Yes.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.720]   Good.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.600]   Sounds good to me.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   Okay.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   That's my thesis.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   I'm sticking with it.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.680]   Largely unchanged.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.600]   Unchanged.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   Are we going to see what else have people been looking for?
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.240]   Let me throw out there that ultimate extras completely gone.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:31.200]   That's what they ever existed.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.560]   UAC's behavior.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.040]   Much less modified.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.200]   Modify it greatly.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.640]   If you're an administrator, you might not even know that it's there.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.840]   And if you're a standard user, it will.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.760]   I've been running in standard and administrator accounts here.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.920]   And even as a standard user, it's, you know, I see it far less often.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.560]   It's a response to complaints from users.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.840]   It's one of the things they hate the most about Vista, but I wonder it is a compromised
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   security.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.640]   I mean, there's a reason they put UAC in.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.640]   Yes.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.800]   So is this going to be less secure?
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.440]   Are they going to have some magic dust that keeps it from?
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.400]   I think they might have overstepped their bounds a little on the first one.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   They went too far.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.400]   Okay.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   For a good reason.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.360]   You know, they did the right thing, but I think they did it for the right reason, I
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.960]   should say.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.240]   I think they are taking a little bit of a step back because of the sheer volume of the complaints
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240]   they got.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.240]   Right.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.240]   So.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.760]   And any reason that they address security at all?
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.840]   Is there any reason to think this will be more secure than Vista?
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.680]   Aside from the UAC stuff, I don't recall much there.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.640]   I mean, there are security features, you know, like BitLocker to go or whatever.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.960]   But I don't think core security has changed all that much.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.960]   Was there anything?
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.960]   No, it's all it's all evolutionary.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:57.240]   And you know, they've been continuing to refine, address, space layout, randomization and other
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.600]   geeky features like that.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.760]   But basically the security architecture of Vista has proved itself to be pretty robust.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.760]   It is pretty secure.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.440]   I think people seem very excited about Windows 7.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.120]   I mean, my general feeling from reading all the coverage of PDC was, hey, this is great.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.920]   This is the way Windows, the next Windows should be.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.080]   I'd say N minus one reviewers.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.080]   Exactly.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   Who is the guy?
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.080]   There's one guy.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   One guy who's mad at Microsoft because they didn't lend him into the reviewers' workshop.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.080]   Who is this guy?
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   I forget.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.080]   Nobody will say.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.040]   He's kind of like the court jester of the Windows world.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   All right.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.040]   All right.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.040]   We won't bring up any names.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.400]   I want to come back and talk a little bit about the cloud.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.320]   Also a little later on the show, we're going to talk to P.C.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.920]   John Hodgman will join us with a rebuttal, I guess.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.920]   I don't know.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.360]   Maybe he's going to throw money at Vista.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.640]   I don't know.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.520]   I do want to mention our friends that go to meeting.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.960]   Go to meeting is, of course, the preeminent online meeting company.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:00.240]   If you've used other online meeting software, even that stuff from people you might have
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:04.320]   heard of in Redmond, Washington, you're going to want to try.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   Go to meeting.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.280]   Go to meeting makes it simple, makes it easy, makes it fast, and we've got a 30-day unlimited
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:16.880]   trial for you that's unlimited meetings for the next 30 days at gotomeeting.com/twit.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   You've tried the other guys.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.960]   I just want you to take you two minutes.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:24.200]   You'll be installed and then you could throw a meeting anytime, anywhere much more compelling
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   than a conference call because it's visual.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.960]   The way it works, you send out an invitation ahead of time.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.880]   You could just click create an outlook email and send it out.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.440]   Or while you're on the phone with somebody, you could be talking and say, "Look, go to
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   gotomeeting.com.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.440]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.360]   I want to show you this PowerPoint.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.880]   I want to show you these documents.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.920]   I want to show you the new taskbar.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:43.480]   I want to show you the new taskbar."
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.480]   I can...
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   Really, you can see it.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   It's just like you're there.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.440]   You're seeing your computer desktop on their screen.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.480]   Very effective way to sell.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:57.320]   By the way, now available for PCs and Macs, that's a new change.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.520]   Very good.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.240]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.280]   Give it a try, 30 days free.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:09.160]   And by the way, one flat monthly rate that's very affordable makes GoToMeeting the right
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.080]   choice for your online meetings.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.480]   Forget those other guys.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.120]   Gotomeeting.com/twit.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.760]   And we thank them so much for their support.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.440]   This week in tech.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.040]   So then Microsoft also mentioned Microsoft Stratera.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.040]   Right?
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.040]   No, no, that's wrong.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   Microsoft.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.040]   Microsoft.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.040]   Microsoft Stigmata.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.040]   Steinnet.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.040]   Azure.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:39.320]   It was strategist a false rumor that they never used that name or...
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.480]   I think that was the codename if I understood it.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.800]   No, but they abandoned that.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   Azure.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   I like Azure.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   AZURE.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   It means sky blue, right?
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.040]   So this is computing in the cloud.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.080]   How important is this to Microsoft?
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:58.120]   Is this strategically the next big business for them?
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.920]   Or is it just MSN?
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.160]   I mean, is it just one more side business?
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:07.440]   I think if this goes according to plan, this will be a lot of their business.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.280]   This replaces Windows and Office?
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.360]   No, no, no.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:18.160]   Right now it's mostly something they can sell alongside on-premise servers.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.200]   In the sense that a lot of AZURE will be hosted services, right?
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.160]   That they'll offer all of their servers as hosted services as well.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.640]   I think for a lot of companies it makes sense to just let Microsoft handle that stuff.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.720]   But they brought in Ray Aussie to do this presumably, right?
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   Yes.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.640]   This was his job.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   This was...
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   Yep.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.960]   So in some ways it is a big focus for Microsoft.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.200]   Oh, I think it's a huge focus.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.600]   I think it was the point of PDC.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   Ed, you agree?
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   You know, that this...
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.440]   I would agree with that.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.960]   I think the...
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.880]   Right now there's a...
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:48:00.280]   The real challenge for businesses isn't deploying desktops and it isn't running file servers.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:07.880]   It's making applications that are enabled that allow their workers to talk to each other
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:13.080]   when they're out on the road or in branch offices and also and even more importantly
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:19.600]   to customers and partners who are geographically and even globally scattered.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:26.960]   And so if you want to do that now, you've got to either contract out with somebody for
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:33.040]   hosting major hosting resources or you've got to build your own data center, all of
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:38.400]   which are expensive and fragile and require a lot of people behind it.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:43.360]   And so the idea behind this is you build one of those applications, you log on to your
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.760]   account at Microsoft where you're paying who knows what.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   And then you upload the thing and boom, it works.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.360]   Now if John C. Devorek were here, he would be saying, "Ah, cloud computing.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.120]   What's the difference between that and time share?
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   It's a bad idea.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.240]   What happens when the cloud goes away?
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.560]   I'm just trying to channel him.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   Sure.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.360]   Oh, what happens when your local server goes away?
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.600]   You know, at that point you would actually be responsible for it yourself.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   I mean, at least in this case, a company that you hopefully trust is storing your applications
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.120]   or possibly your data up in the cloud for you.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.720]   You might as well, you know, in a way, leave it to the experts.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.200]   Even as I say that, it sounds vaguely odd, but I would rather have Microsoft host email
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.480]   than host email here locally.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:31.800]   Well, I guess we're getting comfortable with this idea and Google is, Microsoft clearly
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.600]   sees Google as the next big threat.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.000]   So if they're going to go after Google, that's how they go after them, right?
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Sure.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.720]   I mean, they're not going to do search.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   But the interesting...
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.720]   They're not going to do search.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.320]   No, no, no, Elio, they're not going to do search well.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.320]   That's what...
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:53.560]   If there's a soft underbelly that Google, it might be these online apps, this cloud computing.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.200]   Well, Google doesn't have a big corporate sale.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   No, they don't.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   They don't have it.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   They don't have any experience delivering service level agreements that cost millions
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:12.640]   of dollars with a selling cycle that takes months or years to corporate customers.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.640]   And Microsoft does.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.960]   So they come in to pick your favorite Fortune 50 or Fortune 100 corporation.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.480]   And they go, "Hey, we can make it so that you don't have to replace all those servers
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.480]   over there."
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:30.040]   They age, you can just take them offline and replace them with these resources in our globally
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.560]   distributed, redundant, protected...
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.560]   Skynet.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.120]   ...federated data center called Skynet.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.480]   Well, in this realm, Google may not be the chief competition.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.440]   It might be Amazon with their S3 service.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.960]   Rack space is moving into that same space as well.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.480]   There may be others doing this.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.080]   I guess there's nobody with the cache of Microsoft in the corporate.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.680]   I think Google is actually the only company that could compete with this.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.000]   I realize Amazon is doing what they're doing, but let's be honest here.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.760]   If confronted by the thought of running Microsoft Exchange, let's say on Google EC2 or running
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:10.200]   it on Microsoft's Cloud Platform, which one are you going to pick?
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.680]   I mean, people are going to pick Microsoft.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.280]   You basically need to have a competitor to Microsoft.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.720]   You need to have a partnership.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.160]   You need to have somebody that has a massive data center infrastructure and somebody that
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.120]   has applications and sales experience.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:30.840]   I think you'd need to have a sales force or oracle combined with a Google or Amazon.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.920]   You put those two together.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:39.520]   If you can make the cultures work and if you can actually get that Frankenstein to live
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:45.120]   and grow, then you've got something that competes with Microsoft.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.120]   Right.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:51.400]   Yeah, maybe that's what happens down the road as things consolidate, as they will naturally
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.000]   do over time.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.600]   I think that this is it was confusing.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.600]   I don't know.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:01.000]   I can't speak for everyone, but I sat through that keynote with somewhat of a glaze, look
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.760]   at my eyes and then later had a briefing, a 45 minute briefing specifically about this
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   topic.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.320]   I have to say, I still walked out of there a little confused and I sort of-
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.960]   It was a second coat of varnish on your face.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.880]   I have never asked so many questions in a briefing in my life.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.960]   In fact, I was that guy and I could feel it.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.160]   I just felt annoying.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.480]   Then they said, did you get what you wanted out of this?
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.240]   I said, were you kidding me?
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.680]   What did I want to get out of this?
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:35.200]   If it was understanding what you're doing, I guess the answer would have to be no.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.200]   Because it's-
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.520]   But does Microsoft even understand what they're doing?
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.520]   That's not clear to me.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.520]   It really isn't.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.640]   I think if they had a coherent strategy, they'd be able to explain it to you, but I think
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.160]   they haven't agreed on what it is.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.880]   I just think this is a multi-layered hydra of sorts.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.960]   There's a lot of stuff going on there that they've got their live services and live
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   mashing.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.280]   On the consumer side, a bunch of these are stuff, but not all of it, but a lot of it seems
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:03.160]   to be specifically targeted at the enterprise.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:07.000]   Maybe it helps to think of it as sort of another version of Windows Server, but one that we
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.800]   don't host ourselves, but one that's hosted and managed and configured for us.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.600]   Up in the cloud, we can run applications on it.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.960]   But how these things all fit together conceptually?
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.760]   I have to say, I'm still a little confused.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.080]   It's something I intend to spend some time on over the next week.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:26.600]   I hope I can come back and a week or two and say, "Oh yeah, I get it."
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:31.440]   But right now, I can't say that, and I am confused by it.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:36.920]   Well, we all have test accounts here, so we can go up and try this.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:42.480]   I'll be building a couple of applications in Visual Studio tomorrow morning between 7am
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.880]   and 7.05.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:50.400]   And then deploying them up to the cloud and seeing if I can get Ford Motor Company to
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.520]   start using them.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.600]   Would you say after PDC?
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.200]   I mean, look, everybody seemed very positive.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:03.600]   Very up PDC seemed to make people feel pretty good about Windows 7, about Microsoft Strategy
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.080]   going forward.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:12.080]   Would you say that the end result of PDC is that people are feeling pretty good about
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.080]   where Microsoft's headed, that they understand where they're headed, they understand what
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:19.120]   they need to do, that they're putting out of the trouble of Vista behind them?
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.920]   I remember a PDC is a developer show.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:28.360]   I would have to say, for a large part of Microsoft's so-called ecosystem partners especially,
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.880]   this has to be a little unsettling, right?
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:36.520]   If this Strata Windows Azure thing takes off, a lot of the way that they make money now.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.480]   Their business changes, yeah.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.960]   Changes that goes away.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.960]   So that's something that was a little bit of an issue, maybe a big issue depending on who
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.920]   you talk to with Microsoft Online Services, which was just three or four very specific
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.920]   products.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.760]   Now they're talking about putting everything up in the cloud.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:57.240]   This changes the dynamics between Microsoft and its partners to a very great degree and
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.240]   it's unclear.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.160]   I can assure you they're not feeling fantastic about it.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:06.080]   But I think customers, developers probably to a lesser degree, people like us who sort
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.440]   of have criticisms or at least opinions about Microsoft.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.600]   I think PDC was a positive experience overall.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.600]   You agree, Ed?
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.640]   Yes, I do.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:23.160]   I think what this showed is a Microsoft that had been, it wasn't just so much that Vista
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:30.960]   had problems because it was that the process that delivered it practically guaranteed a
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.520]   problematic product.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:40.600]   I think what they demonstrated at this year's PDC was that they have dramatically changed
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:47.320]   those processes and the product that they delivered coming out of that reengineering
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:54.600]   is really good and should give anybody who's a Microsoft partner some hope that they can
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.400]   really start firing on all cylinders again.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.480]   Excellent.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   Some good news.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   Rafael, you agree?
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:11.480]   I can't provide the background that Ed and Paul have, but I'm excited and I'm confident
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:17.720]   that Microsoft is going to ship the greatest windows yet.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.720]   Really?
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.680]   After you would say that?
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.680]   Yep.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.360]   The greatest windows yet?
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.640]   Well, it ought to be.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:32.480]   I was going to say every arguably every version should be the greatest windows yet.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:37.640]   Well, I could think of a couple of exceptions, but we won't belabor that.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.120]   If all goes, well, it should be better.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   Right.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   Of course.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   It's the next generation.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.680]   But not just the product itself.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:51.440]   I would argue that and have argued that Vista is a final S, especially in its current SV-1
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   guys.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.560]   A final S is not a recommendation to get people jumping up and down.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   It's fine.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.560]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:00.560]   Well, I'm actually very enthusiastic about this.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.200]   It's extremely fine.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.920]   I was until I saw this.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:09.560]   But this is the type of thing where I think people have, we saw them respond to it in a
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.840]   very positive fashion.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.160]   And will, I think, out in the general public, when people see this, I think they're going
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.680]   to respond to it in exactly the right way.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.960]   And I think that's what Microsoft really needs is not.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.760]   That's just to do something that's technically excellent, but to really excite people in a
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.320]   way that they just haven't in a long, long time.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.320]   Excellent.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.160]   Let me put it in these terms.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:35.520]   What was the version of Mac OS that was 10.1 or 10.2?
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.200]   I forget what animals those were.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.440]   Panther or Jaguar or something.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.640]   Jaguar was a big one.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.360]   Panther was probably the one where everybody said, "Whoa."
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.360]   Okay.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.280]   So start with one of those and compare it to Leopard.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.600]   And would you say, "Boy, that one, that Panther really sucked, didn't it?"
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.600]   Because this is Leop--
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   No, you're right.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   So good.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.600]   You're right.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   Okay, you're right.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.000]   Put it in the terms that I can understand.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   Thank you.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.560]   After three, four, or five years of development, which is what we've-- you know, we've had
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.640]   three years since VISTA was pretty much locked down to the time when this is going to come
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.640]   out.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:15.520]   In three years of development, you should be able to do some pretty awesome stuff.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.520]   Absolutely.
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:17.520]   Absolutely.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.520]   Well, I'm excited.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:26.000]   I mean, I think in a way, I think people-- VISTA-- I'm not sure why VISTA disappointed.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.360]   It could have been the long wait.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.080]   It could have been the fact that people had compatibility issues, although that happens
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.720]   every time.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:39.360]   But for some reason, the perception was of disappointment with VISTA.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.560]   And it's been tough for Microsoft to shake that off its heels.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.560]   And this may be--
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.560]   Well, that's--
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.720]   --maybe the seven is what they needed to do to go to that.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.560]   This is exactly what they needed to overcome that.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.800]   Whether rightly or wrongly you feel that VISTA was a problem, there's clearly a perception
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:55.800]   problem.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   Guys, I really appreciate it.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.240]   Paul Therad, of course, the Windows Weekly Host.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.760]   And you can hear from him every Thursday on this network.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.440]   And watch us record the show every Wednesday at live.twit.tv.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:11.960]   We do it at 11 a.m. Pacific.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   That's 2 p.m.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.960]   Eastern time.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   Thursday.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.960]   Thursday.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   Thursday.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.960]   Thursday.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   Records Wednesday.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.960]   No, no.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   Friday, records Thursday.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.200]   It airs on Friday.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.200]   You're right.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.960]   You have way too many buttons to push.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.960]   You're right.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   I'm going like this.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.960]   You're absolutely right.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:39.280]   It airs on Friday, but we record at 2 p.m. Eastern and come by on Thursday and say hi to Paul.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.080]   And Ed, I hope you'll come by and visit once in a while too.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.080]   It's always great to talk to you.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:47.680]   I've known Ed since Judivorek and I started doing Devorek on computers many moons ago.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:51.720]   I would be delighted to do it, but don't expect me to remember what day.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.720]   I don't remember.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.160]   So I don't know how you would.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.960]   You find Ed bot on ZDnet.
[00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.920]   He is a blogger there at blogs.zdnet.com/bott.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.440]   And of course, look for his great books.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   And we look forward to talking again very soon.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.080]   And I know Raphael, you're going to be getting to work pretty soon on the next edition of
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.960]   Inside Windows or Windows Secrets or whatever it is we're going to call it this time.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.320]   Will the Windows Secrets 7?
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.040]   The Windows 7 Secrets.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.520]   Better even than that.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   Or Windows 6.1 Secrets.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.160]   Oh, there you go.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.440]   Or 7 Secrets about Windows 6.1.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.760]   Actually, that'll be the first secret.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.480]   It's 861.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.960]   It's a secret.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.000]   Within windows.com is Raphael's blog.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   Great to have you on.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.240]   You did a great job, Raphael.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.240]   I appreciate it.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   Thanks, Lee.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.240]   I hope to talk to you.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:48.520]   So, hang up on you guys and introduce you to another character as we get ready for the
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.320]   second segment of this week in tech.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:55.680]   Good evening, Boing Boingers and Happy Halloween to you.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.360]   Tonight is the haunted night when we dress up our children in dark clothing and send
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.640]   them out to wander the streets alone and thus remind them of their mortality.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:12.920]   It is the perfect night for me to give you at last my tasting notes on Crystal Head vodka.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.400]   And we're glad to.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:21.600]   That is John Hodgman, you know him, of course, as PC from the great Max Switcher ads.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.360]   You might have seen him on seeing him with Josh Stewart on The Daily Show.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.440]   And of course, he's on stage from time to time with his friend Jonathan Colton.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.840]   Let me see if I can get.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.120]   Through the magic of Skye.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.280]   Hi, John.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   Are you there?
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   I am here.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.280]   Thank you very much.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.840]   Oh, thank you very much.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840]   How are you today?
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.280]   Well, I can't tell you how nervous I am to be here.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.520]   Don't be nervous in the least.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.840]   In fact, before we talk, I want to do my audible commercial because I wish the new book were
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.840]   unaudible.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.840]   Are you recording it?
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840]   It shall happen.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:02.800]   We are Jonathan Colton and I will record it after we complete this book tour.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.320]   That way we will know what to say on the audiobook.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.120]   So is Jonathan part of the new book?
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:13.520]   Well, you know, he went on tour with me for the last book and he would play guitar.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.520]   Right.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.520]   And he dressed up in a...
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.520]   For the old lobster.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520]   Exactly.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.520]   So yes.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.560]   And he played the part of my feral mountain man companion.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.280]   I claimed to have found him wandering raised by woodland creatures in the woods of southern
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   Connecticut.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.520]   You know what that year did not far off, actually.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.520]   Well, I know.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.200]   Well, that was the entire idea.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.640]   I mean, he was just asking to be branded as a feral mountain man.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   Maybe he wanted that secret.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.160]   Grow a big grizzly Adam's beard.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.160]   That's what you get.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.720]   He is in the recording of the areas of my expertise playing for your lobster and playing
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   along with you.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.840]   And I have to say, I'm listening along to the book and all of a sudden there's Colton
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.600]   and it really, it just was fun.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.200]   I mean, it's some sort of weird geek universe colliding.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.480]   This is our recommendation.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.560]   We audible has been a sponsor of the show for almost two years now.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.560]   We love audible books.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.560]   Oh, kidding.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:11.240]   And I'm thrilled that you recorded this yourself read by the author adapted for audio on six
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.960]   or more CDs actually.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.240]   These three hundred CDs.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.560]   I think once you got to the hobo names, it kind of ballooned.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.040]   The hobo names are all in one single CD.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.680]   They take up an entire CD.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.800]   700 or more.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   So well, 700.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   Yes.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.600]   We owe you a hundred because in the paperback, we I added another hundred hobo names by popular
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.320]   demand.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.360]   What was the session like when you actually recorded 700 hobo names?
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.360]   Torturous.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.560]   I can sort of imagine.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.360]   Well, the here's the thing in my book for those people who haven't read it, my first
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.960]   book, the areas of my expertise and indeed my second book, more information than you
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.680]   require, which was just published are both all minacs of trivia, much like the old Guinness
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.160]   book of records or Ripley's Believe It or Not or Book of Lists with the exception that
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.040]   all of the amazing true facts in my book are made up by me.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.800]   And I included quite a bit of information about the hobo's of the Great Depression and
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.040]   their ways and their culture and their brief takeover of the United States government.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.560]   And I also talked about the 100.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.720]   And it seemed like a very funny joke at the time because my friend, Sam Potts, who designed
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.520]   both books long ago had given me a book called 700 Sandwiches, which was hilarious to me.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.520]   I mean, that's exactly what the book was.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.760]   And you would just flip through the book and I'm like, yeah, more sandwiches.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   Peanut butter and jelly.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   Far again.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:41.720]   It was published sometime in the 30s, I guess, during the sandwich craze of the 30s.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   People couldn't get enough of them or could at least they at least required 700.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.800]   And so that always stuck with you.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   So how about 700 hobo names?
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:54.680]   And this will be a funny joke because it was the closest I could get, I think, to a literary
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:59.760]   site gag because the idea was you would start reading the 700 hobo nicknames and they were
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:05.240]   like Frypan Jack and Tennessee, Slim and Giant Leathery Wings Roland and what have you.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.080]   It got pretty esoteric and weird.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:11.360]   I listed all of the skexies from the dark crystal in there because I got went through some
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.920]   dark faces where I was just like, now, but hobo name 396.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.920]   And I don't think I put a Leo LaPorte in there, though.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   I probably should.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.920]   And you know, when you get into hobo name 400, you think you're going mad.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.920]   Because you have another 300 to go.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.920]   Oh, wow.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920]   My math is, it's madness.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   Painful.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.240]   And when I finally got it done, but they all had to be distinct because the whole point of
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.360]   the gag wasn't that someone would sit down and read them all, but that you would have
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.840]   them all listed.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.920]   And then when you saw them, you would like, he didn't actually do this.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.520]   He's going to start repeating them eventually.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:53.160]   And then, you know, I had to prove that they never repeat even as they go on into the margins
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.960]   of the rest of the book because there's really no room for them.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.080]   So when we got all of that done, I was like, I'm glad that was a funny idea, but it really
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.800]   did push me to levels.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.280]   I really felt like I was on my own in the universe.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.360]   Like, no one like it's a long march.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.360]   It's a long march.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.640]   And then I asked anyone who's written down 700 "Hopundick" names and they'll tell you
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.560]   the same, I think.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.400]   It's a universal experience.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.800]   But then when we deliver, I think it's a parasite.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.800]   Yeah, it's a print thing.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.800]   It makes sense.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.960]   It certainly makes sense as a print thing.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960]   That's a good point, Leo.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.120]   You're right.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.800]   It made sense from the beginning as a print thing.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.720]   It never makes sense until it's done.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.480]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.440]   And then, you know, we were just, I was trying to figure out what to put on the website
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.680]   areas of my expertise.com.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.280]   Now your catch all website for all things pertaining to either book.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280]   Yes.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.600]   And I said to Jonathan, let's, you know, we should do, we should probably include a reading
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   of some kind.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.800]   Let's drive people crazy and do the 700 "Hobo" names.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   And he was game.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.960]   But I didn't realize that we weren't going to drive people crazy.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.640]   We were going to drive us crazy.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.640]   Right.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:09.720]   Because the idea was we would sit in his, what was then his office, now his children's
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720]   room.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:14.040]   And we would record it on his computer while he played.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.040]   It was a very low tech operation.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:20.720]   We had a single microphone and he had his guitar out and he played Big Rock Candy Mountain,
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.760]   the great hobo anthem of our time.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.000]   Behind me, over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.560]   How many names per iteration of Big Rock Candy Mountain can you get?
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:35.960]   I'm going to leave that to your listeners.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.960]   I would like to know the answer to it.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.400]   And I'm not really interested in finding out myself.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.840]   So I'm going to crowdsource this one.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.760]   People should go to Audible and buy the audiobook.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.720]   Because they can hear it.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.480]   And that all 700 hobo names on that cut.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.960]   Is that track, though, on the Audible, is that the one you recorded in Jonathan's study?
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.960]   Yes.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   Did you think we would do it again?
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.560]   No, no, you're right, of course.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.560]   What was I thinking?
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.160]   I mean, it was, you know, nothing was looped and it was all a single take.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.520]   So you hear me often going, "Excuse me, well, I have to take a drink of water."
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.400]   Or like attempt to kill myself.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.160]   Needles in the eyes, actually.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:19.240]   It was, you know, and the idea was to make it sound like the numbers stations.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.600]   Do you know what I mean when I say the numbers stations?
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.600]   Yes.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:27.880]   There's weird bi stations that on the shortwave band and on the sort of ends of the AM dial,
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.800]   particularly in Europe where you just hear a voice speaking numbers.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.880]   And no one knows what they are.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   They think it's...
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.400]   They've spiked it, it's bi-code of something.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:40.280]   And there's a great, there's a beautiful compilation of it available on the internet.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.200]   You can buy of just recordings that have been amassed of all these different strange
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.200]   broadcasts.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.200]   No one knows the origin.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.000]   I'll have to look it up at some point when we take a break because that would be my audible
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   request.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.560]   We need a book of that.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.560]   And I think it's a...
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.560]   It's a mate.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.560]   You know what we should do?
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:01.120]   We should take those recordings of those weird numbers stations and we should do a transcription
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.400]   and publish it as a book.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.400]   There you go.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   That would make sense.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.040]   Hard to think of anything with more drama than 700 hobo names, but maybe you found it.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.040]   What about 700 mole man names?
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.780]   Is that book three?
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.780]   And their occupations.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:18.600]   John, I would stop.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.560]   This could go on too long.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.840]   But do get that areas of my expertise read by John Hoddman.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840]   Hoddman abridged.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.080]   I don't understand why abridged if you leave it.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.160]   In my books, there are lots of tables and charts.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.720]   There are one or two tables and charts that did not...
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.320]   Just did not work in the audio format.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320]   You think if...
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:41.280]   The way Robin Gold was reading all of the table headings and stuff.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.680]   I would say there are only one or two things that didn't work.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.360]   If you leave in 600 hobo names, you'd think that you might...
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.360]   I don't know.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.280]   Anyway, the hobo names are in there.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.160]   They are in the audio version of the areas of my expertise.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   Yes.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.160]   Hard to believe.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.640]   The 700 mole man names will be in the audio version of my new book.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.880]   More information than you require.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.560]   But right now they exist only on paper, where as you say, they make sense.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.560]   Maybe I was...
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.840]   Maybe I was going a little too far with that.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.040]   But do you're commercial for Audible?
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040]   I will.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.040]   Why not?
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.040]   Audible.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040]   It's simple.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.040]   It's a pleasant one long commercial for a hobo.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.080]   Get the book, The Areas of My Expertise, by John Hoddman.

[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.160]   John, I'm so pleased to talk to you.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.880]   It's an enormous pleasure for me, I have to say.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.960]   I'm flattered that you would say that.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.960]   But you're the guy.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.280]   I mean, the Daily Show, you're right.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.960]   You're a writer first, though, aren't you?
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.560]   Isn't that what you consider yourself?
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.320]   It's back when I was a freelance magazine writer.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.520]   I had been briefly a professional literary agent.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.880]   And then I became a freelance magazine writer.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.720]   And it was one of those lazy afternoons when I was lying on the couch doing nothing and
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.640]   watching Thunderbirds on tech TV, which I had never watched before.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.800]   I mean, I'd seen Thunderbirds before, but I hadn't seen on tech TV.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.800]   You know, this is an ancient history.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.800]   And then I saw the screen savers.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.120]   So you and Patrick there, and I was like, what is this fantastic show?
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.720]   I had no idea what you were talking about for the most part.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:33.120]   I'm not as up to the minute in technology as Jonathan Colton is.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:39.280]   The irony is that I turned to the feral mountain man when I need briefing on any technology,
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.520]   frankly.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.520]   And I'm called him up immediately.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.760]   I'm like, you have to watch this program because I felt it was obviously was a live program.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.960]   And it was just so genial and fun.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.280]   And there was such a spirit of camaraderie to it that I just became hooked.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.280]   Oh, you're so kind.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   Well, that's true.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.680]   And then, you know, everything else happened.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.080]   And then I then I picked you up on the podcast and I've been listening.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.080]   I was just you and you and Colton are neighbors.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.080]   Are you not?
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:07.400]   We now live in the same utopian commune that is ruled by children called Park Slope Brooklyn
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.400]   Park Slope.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.160]   But, but we we went to college together.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.160]   Oh, I didn't.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   Yale University.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.960]   Oh, we're all blues.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   Exactly.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.760]   So you see the world government conspiracy in action again.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.760]   Skull and bones.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.760]   I have to leave now.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:30.960]   No, I was never I was never a never tapped.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.160]   When were you when were you at Yale?
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.120]   Oh, between 1989 and 1994.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.680]   Okay, so you're much younger than I.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.840]   So we missed each other, sitterably under the new are.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.440]   Oh, yeah, I was there in the seventies.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.440]   That's fantastic.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.160]   Right after they added women, did they have all those buildings at the time?
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.560]   Most of them were still there.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.440]   Maybe they built them just for me is that the experience of every college student.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.920]   Look what they made for me.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.920]   I'm going to try to destroy it.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   It's awesome.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.280]   It's just my generate the funny thing at Yale.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:06.120]   I'm sure you admired it as these little gargoyles made during the depression by crazy Italian
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.120]   craftsmen.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.120]   Yes.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:13.040]   They're all over being men being arrested by the police and that sort of crazy stuff
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   in the library.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.200]   Yeah, you got just all stain stuff.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:23.480]   Well, it was wandering through the stacks of Sterling Memorial Library that really sort
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.560]   of inspired my books to a large degree.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.480]   You know, this supposed repository of complete world knowledge and the completely esoteric,
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:38.240]   weird things that you would find in that library going up and down that little almost
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.240]   manual elevator.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.080]   Did you ever go on this high speed up, down onto the mezzanine floors that the regular
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.080]   elevator didn't serve?
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.160]   I like wandering through bizarre fantasy.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.160]   It was.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.640]   We used to find a weird literary journal that would talk about somebody that you knew once
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.280]   and like, wow, that's weird.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:14:00.320]   We tried to stay in there after hours several times because there's something kind of spooky
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.280]   and mysterious about the...
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.320]   Did you ever go to the roof where they have the miniature Sterling Memorial Library on
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320]   top?
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.320]   You know, I heard about that.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.320]   I've never seen it.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.320]   I hear that it's true.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.320]   It's...
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.320]   It...
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.000]   It's another little version of itself on top of another little version of itself.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.400]   And how long does that go?
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.400]   I wonder.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.280]   Well, it's an infinite recursion, isn't it?
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   I guess it is.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.560]   Oh, so otherwise, when they...
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.080]   When they're down and like that, they better make it a damn fractal.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.160]   What's the point, if not?
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.560]   So how did you get involved with the Apple Switch commercials?
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.800]   Because I think that's really...
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.520]   I mean, people are...
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.440]   You have huge fan club, but those put you on top with the world.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.200]   I mean, everybody sees those.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.200]   That must change your life.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:49.440]   I had been a freelance magazine writer, and then I had this idea.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.000]   Someone said, "You know you should write a book of trivia because you love that stuff."
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   And I said, "You're absolutely right.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   I do love that stuff."
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.840]   But there have been lots of books of trivia.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.280]   So why don't I try to put my own stamp on things by writing books of fake trivia?
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.280]   Right.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:07.120]   So, you know, I mean, the proof of concept idea that I had that made me want to sell
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:13.200]   it was instead of like the book of lists, sort of nine presidents who had asthma or
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.560]   whatever, I would have the nine presidents who had hooks for hands.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.040]   I'm just talking about it with a very straight face.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.040]   This became your niche.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.320]   And so I called up this editor and I said, "Let's go."
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.040]   Nine presidents said, "If hooks for hands, you've got to see the possibilities."
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.000]   He's like, "I like my idea better."
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.440]   But eventually I ended up writing that first book of fake trivia called "The Areas of
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.440]   My Expertise."
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.520]   Which I love.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.280]   And I may remind your listeners that I have just completed a second one, not to get ahead
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:42.000]   of ourselves, called "More Information than You Require," which we can talk about later.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.840]   Same idea there is the...
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:50.560]   My proposal for the second book was almost exactly this long, more of the same book twice as
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.560]   long.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.120]   And they snapped it up.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:58.640]   Well, my concern, well, because at that point, you know, I had gone on the daily show with
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.040]   John Stewart to promote the areas of my expertise, which changed the fortunes of that book and
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.840]   my life dramatically to go on television.
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:07.840]   Because you know what?
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.840]   Apparently people watch television.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:09.840]   Well, yeah.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:10.840]   And there's something about you.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.840]   You're kind of cute.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.340]   Oh, that's very kind.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:14.340]   No, you are.
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.040]   There's a certain something about your...
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.200]   Just been drinking the Crystal Head vodka now.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.160]   Oh, that crystal head looks good.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.160]   It's very good.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.920]   Very good vodka, I have to say.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920]   You know, I don't want to digress.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.120]   But my dream in life is to sit down with Dan Aykroyd and a bottle of Crystal Head vodka
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.880]   at the House of Blues in Mandalay Bay and just say, "Dan, what the hell?"
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.880]   What are you doing here?
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:37.880]   No.
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.880]   You know the whole story behind the Crystal Head vodka?
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.640]   Well, I watched his video on the site.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.840]   I mean, it kind of goes on and on.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.280]   I don't think I've completed it.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.080]   Oh, you know, you have to watch the whole thing.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.000]   It's really the 700 hobo names of vodka commercials.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.560]   You've go into a long time.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:58.800]   Because it is either the most wonderful dead pan joke in the world, or it is the most earnest
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.760]   endorsement of a paranormal vodka in the world.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760]   Right.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.760]   And it's brilliant.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.760]   Same.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.920]   I love it when suddenly he's in the bar and there's Crystal Head vodka.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.480]   I'm going to stack to the roof.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.480]   Well, that's what it's like in Canada now, I think.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.240]   And I really say this.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.500]   You know, I only would plug a product if I loved it, whether it be Apple or Crystal Head
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:27.640]   vodka or my own books or Jonathan Polton or a Twit or a Munch Nast or whatever.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:32.480]   But I hope that it is understood because I don't doubt that on some somewhere Dan Aykroyd
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.000]   will hear this, that I say this with all affection for Dan Aykroyd.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.400]   He's a genius and a hero of mine.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.720]   And I would just love to get into the House of Blues with him in Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas,
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.720]   but some Crystal Head vodka and just suss it out and just get to the bottom of it.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.800]   I think we can let's arrange that.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.760]   But I digressed from the story, didn't I?
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760]   That's fine.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.920]   I forgot even what the question was.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:51.920]   So what happened?
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.760]   Pick up anywhere at that point.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:57.680]   Well, I was the night before I went on the daily show that John Stewart, I would have
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.200]   been very happy to be a fake book of fake trivia writer for the rest of my life.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:07.760]   Indeed, as I will be, as I suspect.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.160]   And then I went on the show and they very nicely asked me if I would come back and do
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.040]   some more comedy on the show.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.480]   And I thought that they were joking.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:19.520]   But now after two years in change of being the rest expert on the show and sort of the
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.680]   fake authority and fake trivia master on the show, I think they were not joking.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.280]   And soon after, in 2006 after, I'd been on the show just for a few months.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.440]   I got a call asking if I would want to audition for the series of ads.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.320]   And so I said, of course, for two reasons.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.880]   One, because I've been a Mac user since '84.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   Really?
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:43.600]   I had a brief period in the wilderness in the '90s when I was working and publishing and
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:49.360]   I was doing some sideline writing and I had a Windows machine.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.120]   Let us not speak of it.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.800]   But I've been a big fan of Mac for years and years and I've been a big fan of the advertising
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.800]   for years and years.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.440]   So I thought, can't go wrong there.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.880]   But mainly I was just curious as to why they would be interested in seeing me.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.640]   I figured I had something to do with the Daily Show.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.800]   But it was really very much out of the blue.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.120]   And I thought, well, you know what?
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:13.080]   I'll go in for the audition because it's something new in my life.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.360]   And I won't get the job, but at least I'll have an interesting story to tell Leo LaPorte
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.960]   someday on his most popular podcast.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.560]   You don't have to plug me.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.560]   It's really...
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.560]   That's okay.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.040]   So what was the first one you did?
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.480]   Do you remember?
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:32.200]   It was a sneezing fit.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.200]   It was called Virus.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.200]   That was the first one.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.040]   Let me play this one because we remember this.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.040]   Do you have a thing?
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.040]   I do, in fact.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.960]   Let me stop it so we get the audio.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.440]   Have you met Justin long before?
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.440]   I had met him the day before.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.440]   The day before?
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   Yeah, but we hit it off terrifically.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.440]   Hello.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.440]   I'm a Mac.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.440]   And I'm a PC.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   Action!
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.440]   Action!
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.440]   Action!
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.440]   Is it in tight?
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.440]   You okay?
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.440]   No.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.440]   I'm not okay.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.440]   I have that virus that's coming around.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.560]   Thank you, you better stay back if this one's a doozy.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.560]   That's okay, I'll be fine.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.760]   No, no, do not be a hero.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.440]   I'll ask you there are 114,000 known viruses for PCs.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.440]   PCs?
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.440]   Not Macs.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.440]   So, just crazy.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:18.440]   I mean, if you feel it, I don't know.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:22.440]   Now, there are a couple things that I'd like to say about that.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.440]   Okay.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.600]   I think that it probably was the sneeze that got me the job on the second.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.720]   I think so because that sneeze is pretty good.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.720]   It was very effective.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.720]   It was very realistic.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:39.160]   But as I say, I was not a trained actor when I got that job.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.720]   Had you been practicing sneezing for other purposes?
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.720]   Say it again, please.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.320]   Had you been practicing sneezing for other purposes?
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:48.400]   Well, I do it sometimes naturally.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.960]   But I just wonder how your sneeze was so realistic if you were not an actor.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.800]   I actually had to redub some of those sneezes.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.040]   No, I had to go into ADR and do some re-sneezing.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.040]   But I really, I mean, it was really at that moment in the audition.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.600]   I'd gone to the audition and I realized they didn't want to see me.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.440]   They wanted to see everyone on the planet.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.960]   Because I went to the audition and everyone I'd ever met in performing circles.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.800]   That's there.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:21.000]   And I kind of went to the audition to find out why they had called me in the first place.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.840]   And the person who was running the audition looked at me after I did my little read and
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.320]   said, "Now, who are you again and why are you here?"
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.400]   I'm like, "I was hoping you could tell me."
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.640]   He had no idea.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:35.400]   But when the second audition happened, I met some of the folks from the agency.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.440]   And in particular, I met Phil Morrison, who's the director of the ads.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.840]   And he also directed an amazing movie called Junebug.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.200]   Oh, wonderful movie.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.800]   And he's such a lovely guy.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:47.840]   And he sort of set me at ease by saying, "We saw you on The Daily Show and that's how
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.760]   you got your name in the hat."
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.320]   And then I had to read the sneezing one.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.640]   And I had that moment realized.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.880]   I kind of have a chance to stop treating this like a weird vicarious adventure and start
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.520]   treating this like a real thing.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.560]   And it's going to happen with the sneeze.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:11.400]   Like either I'm going to sell the sneeze and put myself at risk of getting the job in my
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.960]   life changing.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.080]   Or I'll hold back on the sneeze.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:20.800]   And sort of just remain sort of at arm's length from the whole thing and not get the
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.640]   job and then have a story to tell.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:26.720]   That's an interesting insight that you knew that that sneeze was a...
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.800]   You just had to...
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.480]   Sometimes you just have to sneeze real hard like you're really sneezing.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.360]   And then after the sneezing, I had to do some human beatboxing, which I don't mind telling
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.600]   you, I'm very good at.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.600]   You are?
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:42.880]   Well, I mean, I have mild 1989 era proficiency.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.440]   Can I hear a little?
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:51.440]   [LAUGHING]
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:57.400]   And it just goes on like that.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.400]   That's about all I can do.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.640]   I'm not really that good at it.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.040]   I'm not Blake from American Idol.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.560]   Is that what you had been a little fit there or something going on?
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.720]   Well, I just kept up very much, didn't I?
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.720]   You want to hear me fake sneeze?
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.720]   A chew.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.720]   A chew.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   [LAUGHING]
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.640]   So at some point you realize this is a fork in the road in my life.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:20.400]   And it sounds like there was a little bit of a trepidation about maybe becoming the
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.640]   television celebrity.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:23.640]   Well, I anticipated...
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:30.920]   I mean, I had and still do have a very happy life as a writer at the time for magazines.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.680]   And then I was doing The Daily Show.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.120]   I had radio full and happy life.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.800]   And in particular, The Daily Show had just started in my life.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.200]   And frankly, that was about all of the sort of life changing upside down world is take.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.200]   Do you know what I mean?
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.200]   Yes.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.880]   But I was just like, I'm ready to just sort of get used to this new life and not take
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.440]   it another step further.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:56.480]   But this was a chance and I realized that I probably still wouldn't get the job even
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.320]   if I sneezed really good.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.320]   [LAUGHING]
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.560]   But you don't stand there.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.440]   You don't stand there in life and not sneeze real good.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.120]   Just because you're afraid.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.800]   So I sneezed real good.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.000]   I beatboxed better than I did now.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   That was fine.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.960]   Maybe I got the job in spite of the human beatbox.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.960]   [LAUGHING]
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:19.280]   And then I would say, you know, a couple weeks past and then, you know, we had some
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.360]   more conversations and they offered me the job and after they offered me the job, I
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.600]   was on a plane within 36 hours.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.600]   Wow.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.920]   And then a fitting right off the plane and that's where I met Justin for the first time.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.920]   And we really hit it off.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920]   You sent me the next day.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.720]   The next day we were shooting that ad that you played.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.440]   You sent me an email which I never responded to and I--
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.440]   Oh, that's OK.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.440]   I deeply apologize.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.440]   I just missed it.
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.440]   I sent a lot.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.920]   You sent me an email and I didn't respond.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:45.920]   OK, good.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.920]   We're even.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.920]   We're both the same as Danzer.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.920]   Absolutely.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.320]   But you said thank you for saying those nice words the other week regarding me, John
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.480]   Hodgeman, as a fan of you, Leo, LaPorte, dating back to the early screensavers' days,
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.560]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:01.760]   I moved to say something on behalf of my friend and fellow consumer electronic device named
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.760]   Justin Long.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.680]   Rumors of whose departure from the big white room were, as you know-- and this was when
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.680]   we were talking about this on Mac Break Weekly--
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.920]   That was a couple years ago, 2006.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.360]   Bogiously swirling around at the exact moment he and I were shooting another round of them.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.400]   I am someone who had never acted professionally before those ads were not for Justin's humor,
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.880]   timing, and generosity I would have been lost.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.120]   You give him a lot of credit.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.120]   He says, "Ew."
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.200]   You said he's doing more work than I am on these ads.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.760]   Well, he has to exercise a lot of restraint.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.600]   I mean, I'm the buffoon.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.560]   So the broader I go-- that's an acting term, by the way.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.560]   I just learned it.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.560]   Very good.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.760]   But you know, I'm a ham.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:44.040]   So the weirder I get, that's okay.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.400]   But Justin is naturally a very, very funny guy.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.880]   And he's doing a job that's very subtle in those ads.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.680]   And I think the sneezing one is a really good example because from the beginning, we were
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.840]   working together really well and we liked each other an awful lot.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:04.040]   And as I'm falling with the sneezing, he takes the handkerchief away from me.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.200]   Oh my goodness.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   And keeps it.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.880]   And it's this beautiful little ballet of Ha Ha there.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:10.880]   And that was him.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.080]   And he just knew exactly-- it was like we knew exactly what to do with that handkerchief
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.360]   from the beginning.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.840]   And you're not going to see that necessarily unless I get on--
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.840]   No.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.840]   Let me play it again.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.840]   I'm not going to see it on the radio either.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.080]   Well, they're watching some of them are watching.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.080]   Oh, I see.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.080]   I apologize.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.080]   So I'll play it for them.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.080]   And those were watching the video.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.680]   There are 14,000 known viruses for PCs.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.160]   PCs got Macs.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160]   It takes it.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.160]   Close your nose.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   I think I got a crash.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.160]   Hey, if you feel like--
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.160]   I don't know.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160]   There is.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160]   And he's left.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160]   He's left hold on that.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.480]   It is absolutely magic.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:47.240]   And every one of those ads works brilliantly.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.080]   Many have pointed out that you're the sympathetic character that in fact these ads for Apple
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.200]   products make people like PC.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:27:03.120]   Well, I think that the character is-- I always imagined him as a guy who was just not very
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.320]   aware of himself.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.800]   And as the computer-- because he's a computer, he's not a person--
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.080]   is the computer who has this massive amount of market share.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.880]   Maybe Man is just sort of stop seeing his own flaws to some degree.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:22.080]   And is actually in that room because he thinks he's helping the Mac out.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.440]   He's going to give him some pointers on how to be a computer.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:32.200]   And constantly sort of trips all over himself and is flustered with his inability to--
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:38.480]   and so that means I think that there are lots of people in the world who feel that way.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.760]   And I think he's a sympathetic machine.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:41.760]   Oh, he's very--
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:48.120]   And the villains are always more interesting characters to play.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.120]   That was all.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.480]   But you know, it helps somebody who-- if you've never acted before, right, and you need to
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.880]   act-- here's a little tip.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.880]   Yes.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]   And you need to act sick.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:57.880]   Yes.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.680]   Like you have a terrible virus, for example.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.080]   Try falling backwards 20 or 30 times.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.800]   Well, you're landing on something soft, I presume.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   I am.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.440]   But I was landing on a mat of pretty heavy, hefty mat.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.040]   It did not hurt me.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:18.800]   But you are sending all the blood in your body to your head in each fall.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.520]   And then to give you an idea of just how surreal the whole experience was-- I mean, this was
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.600]   again for a stage shooting.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:29.320]   And this is a stripped down production.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.920]   It's just two guys in a white room.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.240]   But there are a lot of people who are helping.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.440]   And because time was of the essence and everything else, they assigned two guys to pick me up
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.440]   every time.
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.440]   So I would fall down.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.600]   Two guys would immediately grab me by the shoulder, put me back up again.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.640]   Like I was some kind of proper machine.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640]   And it was amazing.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.160]   I was like, OK, let's go again.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.160]   Here we go.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.240]   And then by the eighth or ninth take or whatever, I felt pretty stuffy.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.360]   How many ads do you do in one day?
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.000]   Do you do a bowl bunch of them?
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.240]   Yeah, quite a few.
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.240]   Quite a few.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.240]   I would say, yeah.
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.240]   Do all of them make it to air?
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.200]   Or there are some that just don't--
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.840]   No, there aren't.
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.040]   I think that we should quite a few more than actually air.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:16.520]   So someday we may have the basement tapes of the switch ads.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.200]   I suspect that that might happen.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.800]   I would love to see some of those.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.760]   You know, we do sort of versions, variations on a theme typically.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.040]   Oh, so all interesting.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.880]   So it's not a hard written script.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.880]   There's some improv going on.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:30.880]   No, no, no, no.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:34.840]   I mean, we'll do a number of scripts, but the scripts themselves sort of revolve around
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.800]   a theme that we're talking about.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.360]   I mean, and they'll pick the ones that work the best.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.360]   Your favorite?
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.560]   And then very rarely Justin and I will add Libeline or whatever.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.320]   But that will make it in.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.320]   But that doesn't happen a whole.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.720]   You can't even think of one where that happens.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.720]   Interesting.
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:48.720]   Your favorite?
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.520]   Does this have a favorite?
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:57.160]   I guess I kind of liked Out of the Box, which is an early one where we're both in boxes
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.520]   and Justin leaps right out and is ready to go.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.720]   And I confess sort of sadly that the rest of me is in some other boxes somewhere.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:04.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.720]   This is--
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:06.720]   I love the one--
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:07.720]   --for the world of the Mac.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.720]   I'm a PC.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.720]   Ready to get started?
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.720]   Well, not quite.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.720]   Got a lot to do.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:12.720]   What's your big plan?
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.280]   I might make a home movie or maybe create a website, try my film.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.280]   I'm a marketing camera.
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.280]   I can do it all right out of the box.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.280]   So what about you?
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:21.600]   Well, first I got to download those new drivers and I got to erase the trial software that
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.600]   came on my hard drive.
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   Sweet.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   And I've got a lot of manuals to read.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.200]   You know, it sounds like you have a lot of stuff to do before you do any stuff.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.400]   So I'm just going to get started because I'm kind of excited.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.320]   Let me know when you're ready.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.240]   Actually, the rest of me is in some other boxes.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.840]   So I'll meet up with you later.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.840]   That would have been--
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.800]   It's good you didn't have to do that leap out of the box.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.640]   No, but you know, I was doing a lot of phony calisthenics in there.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:47.200]   They did not use the take where I used my Asma inhaler, which I was hoping.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.720]   But it would kind of break the-- because a computer would never use an Asma inhaler.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.360]   But it's very funny.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:58.720]   Believe me, I've got a lot of laughs out of a strategic deployment of the Asma inhaler
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:30:59.720]   in my time.
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.000]   Do you just keep one in your pocket for--
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.800]   Well, for breathing, first of all, on second.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:04.800]   Oh, all right.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:05.800]   So actually use it.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.800]   All right.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.440]   It could prop to have though, too, even if you didn't need it.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.440]   How do you think I became a geek?
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:15.640]   Because I could run and jump real good.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.800]   There always does seem to be Asma at some point in there.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.520]   Do you have kids yourself, John?
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520]   I do, indeed.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.520]   How old are you?
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.960]   I have a six-year-old and a three-year-old.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:24.960]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.760]   For reasons of privacy, I don't say their names out loud.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   That's fine, yeah.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.000]   I've heard of them only as Hajmina.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.840]   And the younger one is Hajmanilla.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:40.440]   You can read about Hajmina in my first book, because I talk about how I'm going to write
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:43.720]   a book about being a parent next.
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.440]   But then in my new book, More Information Than You Require, I reveal that I forgot to
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.840]   write that book.
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:52.600]   And also, because I'm now a famous minor television personality, I don't really have
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.680]   time to write all those books.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:01.280]   So I'm hoping my three-year-old son will pick up the quill and follow my footsteps,
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.320]   presuming that they give him enough time to do so in boarding school.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.080]   You've shipped them off already.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.240]   Oh, I've got a lot to take care of here.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.680]   All that crystal-head vodka for one.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.720]   Do they see the ads?
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.800]   Do they have a thought about them?
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.600]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.000]   Of course they do.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.080]   And I think they tend to be amused by them.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:29.200]   Like everyone in the world, they like the pizza box one quite a bit.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.200]   But I don't know.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:34.680]   I can't imagine what it's like to see your parent on television.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.720]   I think it gets very normal very quickly.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.720]   It does.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:42.280]   My kids basically at that age, they said, "Just put the cartoons back on."
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.400]   Yeah, except why?
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:47.440]   Because you're turning on the TV going, "Look at me, I'm on TV."
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.880]   "Can you put the cartoons back on, please?"
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.880]   We're watching here.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.520]   It's a strange life.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.520]   And I talk a lot about it.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.680]   Because when I sat down to write my second book of fake trivia, there's a lot of fake
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.560]   trivia in my new book of fake trivia.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:04.880]   There's a lot of how to rid your house of common household pests like mice and ants
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.400]   and Scottish terriers.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.360]   There's a lot about how to tell the future by looking at the spleen of a pig and that
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.000]   sort of thing.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.240]   There's a lot about what to look for when you're buying a computer from a street bender.
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.600]   But that's an old Jonathan Colton story that I sort of discussed.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:25.760]   Jonathan Colton, actually in New York one day, was walking around the Upper West Side where
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.040]   we both lived for some time.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:33.440]   And he was telling me how he saw a woman go up to a guy who was selling a bunch of garbage
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.400]   on the streets, which you would see sometimes in New York City.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.880]   You'd have to blank it out and there'd be some old video cassettes and some old CDs
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.880]   and some old books.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:46.040]   And then there was some old laptop of some kind.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:53.360]   And the laptop was clearly in bad shape and the screen had a crack right down the middle.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:57.600]   And the woman was saying, "Well, I'm not sure if I should buy this computer."
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.360]   He's like, "And the guy was saying to her, according to Colton, of course."
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.360]   "Oh no, no, no, it's fine.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.360]   It's fine.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.360]   All it needs is a program."
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.360]   And I love that story so much.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.040]   So in my book I talk about how Jonathan told me that story and I say, "Of course I understood
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.240]   exactly what the problem was there."
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:23.000]   A lot of casual consumers don't understand computer lingo like a program.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.120]   So that's going to scare her off.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.080]   You need to tell her in ordinary language.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.480]   What it really needs.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.920]   What a program really is.
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:33.920]   Do you want to tell her?
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.480]   Because a bunch of books and books.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.640]   So I can't wait to read this new book.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.480]   It's available at Amazon and of course bookstores and stuff.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.240]   I know of all your local chain and independent bookstores of course.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.960]   And have you been doing a book tour on this?
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:49.800]   I see that you're going to Washington State in a couple of days and then Portland, San
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.640]   Francisco on the 10th.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.640]   Colton has been in Europe.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.640]   Right.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.960]   He's in England and Ireland and Scotland.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.440]   And he's just getting back right now and so I've been touring by myself in Chicago and
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.640]   lots of other fun places.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.720]   But now starting later this week we will be touring the West Coast together and it shall
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.720]   be fantastic.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:10.720]   I dare say it.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:11.720]   Oh, Dan.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.880]   Where are you going to be in San Francisco on the 10th and the 11th?
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:14.880]   Where can I see you?
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:15.880]   Because I'm coming.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.880]   I want to see that.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.360]   So in first we'll be in Seattle on the 6th.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360]   Yep.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360]   At town hall.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:24.240]   Then we'll be in Portland as part of the Wordstock Literary Festival in Portland, Oregon.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:28.120]   And San Francisco, the 10th City Arts and Lectures with Dave Eggers.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.120]   Oh, fantastic.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.840]   That may be sold out.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   Take a look.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:36.960]   But certainly we'll be at a book passage in Cordy Madeira on the 11th.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.200]   Oh, that's my good friend, Lane Patrick Shelley.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.200]   I know that well.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200]   We'll go down there.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.960]   It's a great, wonderful bookstore.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.680]   And then LA on the 13th at the Echoplex Book Soup.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.520]   All the details are available.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.040]   Book Soup is the bookstore down there.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.880]   But it's going to be off-site at a place called Echoplex somewhere in Silver Laker
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.480]   Echo Park or something in LA.
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:56.480]   OK.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.400]   And those will be the four big shows.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:02.720]   And all the details can be found on areas@myexperties.com.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.320]   I love the web design.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.720]   Who did the design for you?
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.640]   That was a designer named Don Ciderilla.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.440]   Ira 404 designs.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.440]   Boy, it's great.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.640]   I was interested in my very smart and wonderful editor Sean McDonald at River.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.200]   I love it because you have an areas of my expertise theme.
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:21.200]   Yes.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.320]   And you have more information than you require theme.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.280]   So you can reset the theme depending on which book I'm going to take your guess.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]   I love it.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.160]   And by theme, we're talking about colors.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.160]   That's all.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:36.120]   The areas of my expertise was in beautiful blue and orange.
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:42.960]   And the new book, of course, is in what Don Ciderilla termed "chocolate and pews."
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.960]   Is that pews?
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:44.960]   I've always wondered.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:45.960]   I would talk to Don Ciderilla.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.320]   It looks more like he's kind of a mustard.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:54.640]   I think there are lots of other very descriptive terms you could use.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.360]   As a father of small children, I actually have some thoughts about that.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360]   Exactly so.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.960]   Catch you on Twitter as hodgman@dgman.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.680]   So dgman is my handle on Twitter.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:07.680]   Yep.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.000]   And is this ad for Hodgman's MacIntoshes?
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   Actually, real.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   That's one of them.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000]   That is real.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.080]   Hodgman, it turns out, when I first got online back in 1997, I did what everyone else did
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.240]   is I Googled Bruce Campbell.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.440]   And that led me to Bruce Campbell and a whole other story.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.800]   But the other thing I did, of course, was Google my own name.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:29.920]   And apparently, what I did not know is in Framingham, Massachusetts, there is a very
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.600]   old maker of fishing gear and waiters called Hodgman.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:41.760]   And apparently at some point, they made MacIntoshes with a CK, meaning the outerwear, you know,
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.120]   the raincoats.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:53.120]   And someone found for me this old ad for Hodgman's MacIntoshes, presumably the Hodgman outerwear
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.400]   company in MacIntoshes, meaning the raincoats, because they're certainly not talking about
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.400]   computers.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.080]   So you've been associated with fine Macs since 1880?
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.000]   Yeah, that's when the ad dated back to it.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000]   It's wonderful.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   Really wonderful.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.360]   John, it's such a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:10.120]   I can't wait to read the new book more information than you require.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.680]   I also can't wait to listen to it.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.480]   So get cracking.
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.960]   Have you started recording?
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:20.240]   No, when we're done the book tour and we've sort of figured out how to perform it and
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:23.280]   what the best parts are and that sort of thing, we'll go into this is what we did with the
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.720]   areas of my expertise as well.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.800]   And really try to get that book tour experience down to the seat.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:31.760]   Oh, yeah, I thought when Jonathan shows up, it was a wonderful part of the book.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.640]   But the whole book is just fun to listen to.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.240]   Oh, thank you very much.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:41.520]   We'll have lots of fun with the audio version and then the paperback version and then the
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:43.840]   I don't know, deluxe coffee table version.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:49.480]   You should know that I want to know that we never did a page a day version of the areas
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:51.480]   of my expertise and that really burned me.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.200]   That's because that's where it's meant to be.
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.000]   That's where the money is, of course.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   Sure.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.520]   And so in my new book more information than you require, it is a page a day calendar as
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.520]   well.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:04.760]   I've included the date on every page as well as a fascinating fact that did not happen
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:07.800]   on that date because I made it up.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:13.600]   So that way you can enjoy my book as a book or as a page a day calendar, just tear out
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:14.600]   the pages as you go.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:21.400]   You know, somebody who actually wrote an almanac with day and date information for every page,
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.840]   I wish I'd thought of that and make it up thing.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.840]   Wow.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.120]   I don't think it makes it that easier.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:27.360]   You still have to type the words.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.960]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:33.480]   It's still an exercise and scraping around your own brain.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.720]   It's a nightmare.
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:35.720]   It is.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:36.720]   It's a nightmare.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.880]   Sitting around and doing exactly what you love for your living.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.080]   How were we so cursed?
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.960]   How did that awful thing happen?
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.320]   How did you get out of the pizza box?
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.320]   Just I'm just curious.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.320]   I don't understand how that worked.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:53.440]   Oh, the physics of the pizza box?
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:56.800]   Do you feel that or is that a top secret?
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:02.760]   Well, no, we shot it at the same time, but with the cameras shooting at different levels
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:08.680]   and I was standing up and there was a pizza box built around my head, which happens all
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:09.680]   the time anyway.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.160]   You're not in the floor.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.160]   And that right.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:19.280]   We had different eye lines and then when they composited it, they shifted me down and just
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.280]   an up so that we matched.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.800]   There's a lot of Hollywood magic going on.
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:25.320]   It is magic.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.320]   It's remarkable.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.320]   It is.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.800]   I hope we haven't spoiled it for anybody telling them the secrets behind it.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.480]   I think that they probably figured out that I was not smashed up until they figured there
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.200]   had to be a hole involved somewhere.
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.400]   I thought you were in the floor.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:39.400]   I don't know.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.400]   I just thought that was what was going on.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.640]   I wasn't the floor, but the floor was higher.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.840]   It was a higher floor.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.240]   A higher floor than the floor.
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:48.720]   Do they shoot those on white or is that a green screen?
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.720]   What are you shooting on?
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:50.760]   No, they shoot them on white.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.360]   They shoot them on big white.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:41:00.360]   They shoot it on a white cyclorama, which is to say it is basically half of a sound stage
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:05.320]   with floor and ceiling all the way up, 80 feet is painted white.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.440]   The floor slopes up to the ceiling so that you have that illusion in it.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.040]   That's how they do green screen and blue screen as well.
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.640]   In this case, it's white and it's really quite vertiginous.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:22.760]   We use about, I would say we stand on about 5% of the white that's out there.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760]   It's really amazing.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.640]   You just walk and walk, walk back and you feel like you'll have forever.
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:27.640]   That's very cool.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.040]   Someday I will disappear there.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:31.040]   Walked off distance.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.360]   Instead of walking off into the sunset, walk off into the white.
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:40.360]   You can read all about my remarkable transition into a famous minor television personality
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.360]   in my book.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:42.360]   Really, you talk about it there?
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.960]   As I sat down to write the fake trivia book, I realized my life has changed a lot and I'm
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:50.360]   telling jokes from a different point of view.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.920]   Even if they're all phony jokes.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:57.400]   In my first book, I had a list of movies and television shows in which I had made cameo
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.800]   appearances because that was ridiculous.
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:06.320]   Like why would a Tweety former professional literary agent ever be in the Muppet movie,
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.520]   I should say, or all the other fantastic claims that I made?
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:14.120]   Then by the time I was writing the second book, I was writing the same style of jokes
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.160]   and I realized it didn't really work.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.160]   It could be true.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.720]   I really realized it when I was sitting at a desk.
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.640]   I do a lot of roles where I wear glasses and sit behind a desk.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.960]   When I was sitting behind a desk wearing glasses in front of Tina Fey making Baby Mama that
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:33.320]   movie where I played the doctor.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.160]   This is exactly what I was describing in my first book.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.440]   This is actually happening.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:43.400]   Life is getting more bizarre than I am at the moment.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.400]   I think you have a very good career doing these kinds of roles.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.440]   I think we'll see you in a lot of films.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.440]   We shall see.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:51.600]   Are you getting a lot of calls?
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:58.560]   Well, sometimes people need someone who wears glasses and sits behind a desk.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.960]   It's a small group.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:00.960]   It's a niche.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.520]   Ben Stein is now getting a little on.
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.440]   Somebody's got to take over.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.040]   I hope that I can be the new George Plimpton.
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.040]   There you go.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.040]   Without the football stuff.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.040]   Right.
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.760]   Minus the football stuff because I don't even know the rules to football but everything
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:15.760]   else.
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:21.240]   From the cameo appearances to the wonderful magazine writing career to the fostering of young
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:25.000]   writers to doing ads for a major corporation.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000]   There you go.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.480]   In front of a largely white screen.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:28.480]   There you go.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.480]   Which is what you do with in television.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:30.480]   Oh, you're right.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.480]   You are.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.480]   You are.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.720]   That was a big thing when I thought about when I was offered the job.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:36.240]   I'm like, well, if it's good enough for George Plimpton, it's good enough for Hodge.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.400]   It's a very good point.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.400]   I didn't think of that.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:39.800]   It's one of my heroes.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:41.320]   Well, John, you're one of ours.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320]   Have we spoken enough?
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.320]   We have spoken enough.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.320]   I thank you so much.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.680]   I'll let you get it to bed or whatever it is you do at eight o'clock.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:48.600]   Maybe have some crystal head vodka.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.600]   Yes, exactly.
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.400]   I thank you so much for your time.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.400]   Great to talk to you.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.880]   We will have you on Twitter as a regular.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:58.360]   I would love any time you'd like to be.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:43:59.760]   And we want to get you on Munchcast.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.760]   I know you have.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:03.960]   I can't wait to talk about fried foods on Munchcast as well.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.360]   Wonderful stories there.
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.960]   Yeah, we can go on and on.
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:07.960]   All right.
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.480]   Well, let's go on and on some other time.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.480]   Thank you, John.
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480]   Take care.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.480]   Great pleasure.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.480]   Thank you.
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.480]   Bye-bye.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.480]   Take care.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:16.480]   John Hodgeman and another Twitter.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.480]   This is amazing.
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:29.840]   And it looks like, you know, judging.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.200]   Hold on a second.
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.640]   I pushed the wrong button.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.200]   Hang on here, John.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.200]   No problem.
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.200]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.400]   I pushed the wrong button.
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.960]   Everybody's disappeared.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:41.960]   Hold on, everybody.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:42.960]   You should have paid attention.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.960]   John, I'm going to call you back in a second.
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:45.960]   No problem.
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:46.960]   Take your time.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:47.960]   It's OK.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:48.960]   Thank you.
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:49.960]   Hold on.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:50.960]   Hold on a second.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:53.960]   It's all very confusing when blue screens are on.
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:54.960]   Zoom call.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:55.960]   There you go.
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:56.960]   Sorry about that.
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.760]   I pushed the button that I shouldn't have pushed.
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.680]   You have too many buttons.
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.760]   I pushed the button and all of a sudden, you were gone and John Hodgeman was there.
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.560]   It was very strange.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.560]   Damn you, Steve.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.560]   Damn you, Steve.
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.560]   Exactly.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.560]   I'm a PC, my ass.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:18.560]   Doing the Twitter.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:26.560]   Doing the Twitter.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.560]   All right.
