Transcript:  Nice to have you all. And a salute to all our men and women in the armed forces who risk their lives  for us every day and especially to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice on this Memorial Day  weekend. We are very grateful to you all and I've worn my American flag tie in honor of that.  Twice a year I get to break this out. Rosh Hashanah and no, no, on the Fourth of July I'll wear it  again. Nice. Yeah. Well done. So and as long as we're talking column, Solemn notes, a very kind  of surprising and sad story. You may remember A Beautiful Mind. Remember that the story of  mathematician John Nash, who was a who was schizophrenic and amazing hallucinations and  yet was also a brilliant mathematician. He and his wife killed in a crash on the Jersey Turnpike  yesterday. They were in a cab coming home from Norway. He'd just given a talk in Norway  and they weren't wearing seat belts and were thrown from the cab when it got in a wreck  and both passed away. Nash was 86. His wife Alicia Nash was 82. Nash was very famous  for many things, but particularly won the Nobel Prize for his game theory work.  In fact, there was a good article or a good conversation, let me see if I can find it on Quora,  talking about what he came up with and the idea that even in complex games that an equilibrium  would often be reached. The example they give often is the détente that was reached between  the Soviet Union and the United States because both had nuclear weapons and mutually assured  destruction kept both from using them. An equilibrium was reached and war never did  break out between the U.S. and the Soviet Union despite decades of tension. The other example  that the guy on Quora gives is if I come home early and my wife gets home late, then I have  to sit around waiting for her. If she gets home early and I'm late, then she has to sit  away waiting for me. So the equilibrium is we both get home early and then we have time with each  other. Anyway, John Nash is very sad. You need to wear your seatbelt. The thing that was creepy

Transcript:  about that, a mile from my house and then another one on the highway, all around the same time,  three car accidents and all cars had someone ejected from the seat. The other two car crashes had the  passenger was ejected and both of them died and then this happened. And you're in a cab, I guess  you don't wear your seatbelt but for peace of mind. I always buckle my seatbelt. I don't know

Start time: 411.50
End time: 415.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

End time: 423.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you're on the highway. If you're in the city and you're just scooting about, the impact isn't  going to be that great. But if you're out on the highway doing 85, just put a seatbelt on. Very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And we should all watch A Beautiful Mind this week, which is a great movie. Russell Crowe playing,  although it fell prey as many movies about mathematicians to this kind of notion that  mathematicians are somehow magically. Same thing happened in the social network. They're writing  formulas on Windows. In fact, Nash did the same thing, writing formulas on Windows.  Comes to them as a great flash of revelation. And I think many mathematicians find that a little  bit insulting. No, I did some work. I actually figured that out. Anyway, I hate to begin on a  sad note. Google I.O. coming up. We have a bunch of nice people in the studio visiting from GDG,  the Google's developer groups. They're all over the world. This is a group from Spain. Nice to  have you. Welcome. They'll be going to Google I.O. on Thursday. Just we're down at the campus  in Mountain View. I was talking to Andreu and I said, do you know anything about what's happening  in Google I.O.? And he hit his face. He said, so I'm going to watch you carefully, Andreu,  when we start speculating. And just tug your ear if it's on track. And if it's wrong, just frown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in here. Hey, could you bring me my cardboard? I meant to get it when I was over there. It's  on my desk. Last year. So one of the reasons people love going to Google I.O. is because  Google is really pretty generous with gear. Last year you got a pixel. No, that was two years ago.  You got a pixel. Last year you got cardboard. It was a little disappointing. It was a flat  piece of cardboard under the chair. It's tough times at Google. But then, you know, Gina Trapani  made this for me because she was there last year and she folded it in the car on the way up. And  it turned out this is actually one of the coolest things ever. This is Google cardboard. And it's  Google's virtual reality thing. And you can go out and buy a lot Oculus Rift for a lot of money or  gear VR for Samsung for a few hundred dollars. The gear VR does the same thing this does

Start time: 545.86
End time: 557.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for nothing. Well, it does a little more, but it does it. It does. It does. Actually,  it's got extra sensors in it that, you know, help, you know, you could turn your head. You're right.

Start time: 557.50
End time: 562.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're right. Although wait a minute, doesn't the phone do the accelerator in the phone do all that?

Start time: 562.56
End time: 589.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most of the work, but it does some gear VR. This does a few things that, you know, enhance the  experience as it were. You know, it's adding some more power to the sensors. But you know,  it's cool because they've also released this thing. You know, they released this publicly.  You can make your own and other. Yeah, it's like open source design. Yeah. And other people have

Start time: 589.92
End time: 605.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  made these. There is the company that makes the those great wooden cases. Yeah.  The bamboo. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They make you can buy like nicer ones than cardboard,

Start time: 606.60
End time: 646.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but you can also print. Yeah, the Savannah College of Art and Design does this cool thing. They  send to all of their students who they're kind of courting. They send these ones that they  branded them. Savannah College of Art and Design, SCAD. And then they send these basically Google  Cardboard versions and then you can download their app to your iPhone or Android. You plop  it in there and then it's got views of all their campus. It's got it's like the coolest pitch for  a school that I've ever seen. I was like, if I was deciding between multiple schools and I was a  little bit, you know, kind of forward looking progressive kind of a techie, I would see this

Start time: 646.36
End time: 662.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and I would just be blown away. This is inspired. It was so neat. This is inspired. So you get in  and they say, well, good. Here's a virtual tour of the campus where you're going to go. You can  put your phone in here. Oh, that is really awesome. Great idea. Yeah, we had one in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aaron Carson from Tech Republic has been writing a lot on virtual reality on the business  applications of virtual reality beyond gaming for most of this year. She also did a great long  feature on, you know, can virtual reality kind of mend its broken promise. You know, it's been  promised for 30 years that it's going to happen. And, you know, will it finally happen? We did a  great long form piece on this. She did a great long form piece on this. This is a good use for  it, I think. A virtual tour of your future home. Yep. Yep. I mean, I would, again, if I got this,  if I was a student, I was trying to decide between schools, this would be, you know,

Start time: 701.56
End time: 706.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  this would be big. And pretty low cost. But there's one problem because doesn't the student have to

Start time: 706.82
End time: 720.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have an Android phone? Or iOS. It works in iOS. Oh, good. It does. It works in iOS or Android. You  download the app and you pop your phone in the thing and then you go to town. That is a great

Start time: 721.46
End time: 732.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  marketing idea. Google actually did this themselves when they opened up their London store. They have  an app that you can download for cardboard so you can do a virtual tour of it. I'm still not

Start time: 733.06
End time: 756.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  completely bullish on VR. But there are some things where that's really good. The nice thing  about cardboard is it's not immersive. It's a little closer to a viewmaster than immersive.  And I don't, immersive I think is not necessarily a good idea. I kind of worry about putting this  helmet on and like losing touch with my surroundings. Maybe I'm just paranoid,  but I'm worried somebody's going to sneak up behind me. Three weeks ago, didn't I just yell

Start time: 756.86
End time: 765.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at you because you were telling me how much you loved virtual reality and digital space on?  That was somebody else you were yelling at. So at least you heeded my warning.

Start time: 765.34
End time: 825.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's somebody else. Actually, Palmer Lucky, who is the guy who founded Oculus Rift and then sold  out to Facebook for several billion, how many billions? Is it three point something? It's huge.  He's being sued by his previous employer, the appropriately named Total Recall Technologies.  Geez. That is a good name for a VR company. They're in Hawaii. They say they hired Lucky  to build a prototype in 2011. He worked for them for a year, latter half of 2011 into 2012.  He got feedback and information to improve the design of the display,  left and then launched a Kickstarter campaign for his own head mounted display called the Oculus  Rift. They want compensation? Yeah, two billion. Two billion was the amount Facebook paid. Yeah.  So by the way, Oculus is a defendant as well. So yeah, Silicon Valley. The Silicon Valley

Start time: 828.28
End time: 881.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  event was last week and there it was interesting. Lucky, he's pretty prickly. He was on the panel  and for a young guy, he's pretty prickly. They were talking about all that VR is getting these  multiple uses, kind of like the ones we were talking about, like SCAD and other things,  medical surgeons are using it so that you can learn how to do some of these things before  you're messing with cadavers and stuff. All these kind of uses that are popping up all over the  place right now. And he was not bullish on that at all. For him, it's like all about gaming and all  this stuff. Is people trying to justify where it's going and all of these kinds of things.  He says it is gaming. He says it's just gaming and all these other things are wishful thinking.

Start time: 882.12
End time: 890.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure I agree with that, but I think gaming is the obvious and best use for virtual  reality because the purpose of virtual reality is immersive, right? To block out the rest of the

Start time: 890.10
End time: 899.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  world as opposed to something like AR stuff like Microsoft's doing with HoloLens is about  annotating the actual world. That's a very different interesting thing. But VR is all

Start time: 899.36
End time: 925.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  about blocking out the world. But the SCAD thing is VR, right? I like the idea that you could tour  somewhere and feel like you can look around and be part of it. So Oculus has an announcement  in a couple of weeks, June 11th. Step into the rift. Which I don't know if that's really a good  tagline. That sounds like I'm going to fall. But is this going to be the announcement of the

Start time: 925.56
End time: 958.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  commercial availability of something? The weird thing is they're hyping this. They were hyping  it last week again too. And it's not clear what they're doing. What more is there to say?  They've already said most of the details for that. Unless there's something else they're going to do  or the biggest thing that's missing is content. There has to be content you want to do.  My thought is just that unless they're making some announcements in terms of content and some

Start time: 958.70
End time: 963.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  maybe deals that they've signed. They've got to say. The next call of duty is going to have an

Start time: 963.24
End time: 969.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oculus Rift version. It's got to be something like that because otherwise what's the hype? I don't  understand what they can do to get me interested in it. Why would I buy it? It's going to be

Start time: 969.88
End time: 974.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  expensive too. It can't be cheap. The SDK, the one that they've got out right now is 400 bucks

Start time: 977.24
End time: 1006.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for the hardware that they're essentially going to release to consumers or something similar to it.  It's 400 bucks. So you've got to think it's going to be in the $300, $400, $500 range. It's not going  to work with any of the gaming systems. It's not going to work with Xbox. It's not going to work  with Sony PlayStation. It's only going to be for high-end PCs. They just threw off Mac. It  worked really crappy on Mac as it were. So it's really only for PC gamers, which is what-

Start time: 1006.92
End time: 1023.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're saying no Linux, no Mac. You have to have a pretty high-end gaming PC to power the  Oculus Rift. That might be why Palmer Lucky is kind of saying no, it's gaming. At this point,  it is gaming. You're going to be buying it as a peripheral for a gaming PC.

Start time: 1024.12
End time: 1067.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you are not, I think you're going to be disappointed. If you don't have a high-end  gaming PC and you buy this thing, you're probably going to be disappointed. We got one in and we  tested it on seven different machines and could not get it to work until we installed it on a  really high-end desktop PC and tweaked it and tuned it and looked through forums to get it to  work and to get it up to 75 frames per second, which is what you need to not puke every time  you look at the thing. It was not easy. They've got a long way to go in six months or so before  they release it to the public because right now, trying to use this thing is a serious exercise

Start time: 1067.54
End time: 1085.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and frustration. I got a prediction, Owen JJ Stone. It's not going to be the Oculus Rift. It's  going to be the Oculus Beats. It's going to be the tie-in with Beats headphones. It's going to  have built-in Beats sound. What do you think? The sound is exquisite coming back from Owen JJ Stone.

Start time: 1085.30
End time: 1132.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, there it is. I got you. Basically, do these people not talk to gamers? Because people that  game, the reason they're on PCs is because they want that speed and access that you get from a  computer. I'm going to put something on my face that's going to be janky and slow. I don't  understand. Stop making it. Give up. Your life is for-fitting and wasting your time.  No, they got $2 billion to make. People give people money all the time for stupid reasons.  This is a stupid reason. You made something that only works on high-end PCs. The people that build  their own computer and play games love the feel and the touch of the mouse and the speed of the  game. I'm not going to put something on my eyes to make me slow down. I don't think it's going to  work. If that's the market you're marketing to, they've already spent all their money on their  computer. They ain't got no money for no Oculus Rift. Oh, that's not true. I see people who buy

Start time: 1133.92
End time: 1141.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  seats for driving games that move you around and they've got pedals and a steering wheel.  So you're really driving on the Indy 500 or something like that. Like I said,

Start time: 1142.00
End time: 1145.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they spent all their money on Kulio. That was as real as it can get. I imagine they're going to

Start time: 1147.60
End time: 1176.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sell a lot of graphics cards and possibly even systems that are saying, this works with Oculus  Rift. I imagine they'll do that, but that's going to be the first wave. It's people with  super high end. They're willing to spend this money just for fun. There's a long way to go  from there to the mainstream. First off, it's only on PCs, not consoles, and you're going to  have the high specs. Then maybe if it goes well, it trickles down, but they've got to make software  announcements. They've got to have good software announcements. If Palmer Lucky is right, it's

Start time: 1177.08
End time: 1188.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  just for gaming. Facebook must have seen more than just gaming in this thing. Why would they buy it?  Unless they plan to become a ... I think Farmville in a 3D world would be just spectacular.

Start time: 1188.62
End time: 1217.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if they feel that this is like foundational technology, that this is the leader in something  that's going to be big, is it that different than Google investing a lot of money in self-driving  cars or something? Is that going to fit with what Google's doing with Search? Maybe, maybe not. But  if they feel like in 20 years or 30 years, self-driving cars is going to be a thing,  why would you not want to own that? They've got the money to spend. So I kind of feel like that's  what Facebook did is they've got the money to spend and they think VR is going to be something,  probably. So why not buy the leader and see if you can use your money to push them?

Start time: 1218.04
End time: 1235.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're right in one respect, Owen. If you're a gamer, what do you want? You want two things.  You want high resolution and you want high frame rate. It's very likely that the Rift ...  I mean, maybe it will be. They're saying, I think, that the consumer version may be as much as 2560

Start time: 1236.00
End time: 1260.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by 1440. That's hard to do with two screens. But you're not just buying frame rate and resolution,  you're buying immersion, right? And I think that's the argument for the Oculus is that it's giving  you a different kind of immersion because you're not looking at a screen anymore and it's moving  with your vision. I'm not sure I buy that, but that would be the argument is that this is all about  high resolution, higher frame rates or something like Oculus are all trying to get you to a more

Start time: 1260.66
End time: 1281.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  immersive gaming experience. The current versions are much lower resolution, but I'm now seeing among  gaming magazines and stuff that they think the consumer version will be that  quad resolution. That'd be pretty impressive. If you can get the latency way down, frame rate up  at that resolution, the computer ... That's why you have to have a heavy computer.

Start time: 1281.88
End time: 1310.00

Transcript:  Yeah. In a perfect world, it'd probably be awesome. So I'd like to see it in a perfect world.  Maybe I'm wrong, but even when you say something about smart cars, at least smart cars, some of  people are lazy. They don't want to drive. That sounds like something that's useful. I really would  like to know what they think this is really going to do. They must think this is going to change  gaming. Someone sold them on, this is going to change the way we game. And then after gaming,  we're going to attack other things. But I like ... Someone's been sold on, we're changing the game.

Transcript:  There are some interesting VR social things. There's this thing called Converge in the long  form article we did on VR. Converge is this virtual world. The cool thing about it is  it's Lord of the Rings. It's like Lothlórien.  I want to be an elf.  You show up in there. The cool thing, there's other people there hanging out. You pick your,  I don't know, character, whatever. It's a virtual meetup space. You go in there and you can have  a meetup. There's also a theater. You can go and somebody can actually give a presentation  on that theater in the theater. It'll go up on the screen in this middle of the woods where  there's this great screen. They also will watch YouTube videos together. They'll have screens  and movies in there. You can hang out. It's like a mystery science theater thing.  Yeah, it's interesting. There is something to it, I think. I think this is why Facebook is into it.  They did talk about this at F8 a little bit. Facebook started out as text updates. Right now,  it's photos. Next, they see video and then they see VR. They see the evolution of status updates  and those kinds of things. I don't know that I buy that because VR is not because it's so immersive.

It's specifically for it and I would bet that if they make an announcement on the 11th,  this will be one of the things they'll show. This is pre-alpha gameplay footage captured with a VR  headset. You can see even on the web page that the fighter is wearing a headset, kind of a VR headset.  You know this looks a lot like one of those classic old Star Raiders games where you're  sitting in a cockpit. Yeah, it's from EVE Online. Yeah, this is EVE Online. Exactly. This is their

I got to get one. There you  go. Yeah. There you go. Give me an Iron Man game and I'm in. If I could just like talk to Jarvis  and have my stuff popping up. Okay, I'm buying one.

Transcript:  I mean I. So actually well then when you said you know gamers have spent all their money.  Well I was thinking there's people playing flight sims with you know you know basically  surround cockpits because they have multiple monitors. I mean that's not at all. Those people  are broke now. Well they're broke. They're broke. Their wives left them long ago but they don't even  know because the macaroni and cheese just sits there on the shelf. We're going to take a break.  When we come back I want to know what Google's got planned. We kind of got into this starting  with the cardboard. But what will they be talking about at Google I.O. on Thursday.  Our coverage by the way will be live from Google I.O. Jeff Jarvis will be there.  You're going right Jason Howell. I'm going. I'll be there. So Wednesday when we do this week in  Google we'll do a preview. But then Thursday we're going to do live coverage. The keynote begins 930  Pacific 1230 Eastern Time. So we will I will be doing TNT on Thursday morning and then we'll  segue right into that coverage with Gina Tripani Ron Richards Aaron Newcomb you I hope and we'll  do what we always do which is watch the keynote together and then comment on it. If you want to  watch the raw keynote I'm sure you can do that instead. But that's 930 Thursday Pacific time  1230 Eastern and 1630 UTC live on Twitch.tv. Hey I will shave clean. I will shave well for that  show because I will shave with Harry's as I do every morning. If you are a shaver you need to  know about Harry's. Nobody likes to shave. Does anybody like look forward to shaving in the morning?  I think not. But Harry's is going to make it as close as you can get to something you want to do  because Harry's is kind of fun believe it or not. Start your day with the Harry's kit and you can  get these very affordably. This is the Truman kit which features a handle. You get four different  colors. I think I have the orange handle. Three blades. Yeah that's the orange handle. Three  blades. These are really good blades. I'll explain what makes Harry's blades so special in a second.  You also get the either the foaming shave gel which I really like if you use like something  like Gillette Edge. This is similar although better and boy does this smell good. Or you can  get the shave cream which is what I use. That comes in a tube. That really gives you a nice  smooth shave. You also get this little protector for your shaving kit so that when you travel around  it lets the blade dry but you don't cut yourself when you reach your hand. Now all of this is  normally $15. I'm going to get you $5 off your first order. When you go to harrys.com use the  offer code TWIT5 at checkout. Harry's is more than just the kit though because once you buy the kit  then you're going to want to get the Harry's blades. You can get them by subscription. I used  to get them every other month. Now I get them every month because I love having a fresh blade.  There's something about it. That's part of the secret to Harry's is because Harry's blades are  half the price of the drugstore blades and twice as good you don't mind changing the blade more  often. You get a better shave, a cleaner shave. While you're at the Harry's site I know Father's  Day is coming next month. You might want to take a look for Dad at a few other things. You get the  Winston set engraved. That's just a little bit more $25 and they have a special Father's Day  shave set. Actually this would be great for $40 that includes and your choice of the forming gel  or the shave cream, the personalized razor and stand. I like that plus all the blades and the  cream and everything. This is a nice gift for Father's Day. Is it bad if I get myself that  for Father's Day? No, that's great. Your daughter's too young to really know what to get you.

I know  many of our viewers do this. When you do it don't forget to use the offer code TWITFIVE  at checkout to save $5 off your first purchase. I just got the stand. It's kind of cool. The reason  I like it is because Lisa keeps stealing my razor. So now I got the stand. It says keep your hands  off my... keep your mitts off my Harry's. They own the factory. That's how come their blades are  sharper, better, high performance blades. The very best at harrys.com. Google I... are you going to...  No, you're just going to watch from afar you said. I will watch the stream. What are we  expecting? There is a leak from Android police and we've heard this leak but I think I'm starting  to believe this. That Google is going to do a new photos app that will basically take all the  features of Google Plus's photos app, the auto awesomes, although they're going to rename that  assistant and make it standalone. Which if you're a Google Plus fan might worry you a little bit  because actually that's one of the best features of Google Plus. In the current... in the app that  they're going to put out, they call it the current app because that's the one they're saying. They're  saying this could change but users can create movies, animations, collages, but the stories  feature from Google Plus is not there nor is the albums feature. And it sounds like...  I would hope you could share back to Google Plus. Album, movies, story, animation, collage.

Transcript:  This looks like a phone app. I don't see a tablet of you on this one. The assistant will make it  easy to use. You know Google already has... they purchased Snapstream and that... the new version of  Snapstream... Oh, Snapseed. Snapseed is easily the best photo app I find on Android and iOS right now.

Start time: 2048.68
End time: 2113.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love... Do you use Snapseed? Well actually they integrated... Google integrated a bunch of  Snapseed features into... Well actually just into your main camera app. So if you go and edit  an image you'll see a lot of the same features from the old version of Snapseed. So maybe they'll  you know do some sort of combining of the new... There's no reason to assume that they're going to  take stuff out of Google Plus. I mean they've been doing that. You know that's kind of what they've  been doing. I don't necessarily think that that means Google Plus goes away though because  they've just actually unveiled a new feature to it not too long ago with collections. So they're  obviously paying attention to it. Basically now they're just saying hey photos can come in handy  all over the place. You know the Bloomberg leak said you know posting images directly to Facebook  and Twitter would also be a part of this new photo service which I mean in Android you can kind  of do that anyways just with the share intent but maybe it's going to be a little bit more embedded.  So I think they're just saying hey these tools are good for other services as well. Why not?

Transcript:  I think we're really missing a good photo. You know a good place to do photos right now. I mean  Flickr has kind of died. You know Yahoo's tried to do a few things with it but it's just not...  It's just lagged for so long. You know 500 pixels is interesting but it's really more for  professional photographers. There's not such a good place for everybody you know who just wants to  put their photos online in groups other than you know Facebook. I mean Facebook's basically  a photo sharing site but Facebook doesn't have great photo tools or even basic photo tools for  the average person who just says like I want to put my photos up and I want to do a few albums  and you know a place to put my favorite stuff. They have Instagram for that. I mean Instagram  right but Instagram is only mobile too. I mean it's not some place you can do you know if you...  I know most people are doing their photos mobile now. That's what I mean when you're talking about

Transcript:  professional like if someone's professional they're not worried about Facebook anyway they're  going to use whatever they're going to use but average people like I know a few people that  only use Snapseed, Instagram and Facebook for their pictures and you know this one girl doesn't have  a computer but she sells her pictures in a gallery locally and she's taking pictures on her Samsung  and I'm like how are you doing this with no camera? She's like I can't afford a camera yet so I was  like that's off your phone? She's like yeah and I use Snapseed and she posts them on Facebook.  People buy her pictures. I'm like she does all that without a computer and I'm sitting over here  with a Mark III 5D looking at myself like I need to shut down Photoshop. I got this deck.

Transcript:  what you can do with Snapseed. I mean it is like a Photoshop. I mean it is the equivalent  you know for I think of Photoshop for mobile. It's the most powerful editing tool  that there is and there are a few other things you can do to add you know to what it does you  know and other kind of that do sort of cute little things but Snapseed is super powerful  and the update that they just did is awesome and it's free. Google bought it made it free. It's on  iOS and Android. It's equally strong on both platforms and it really is you can do amazing  things with that. I've had another people a number of people you know ask me you know about photos  that they were like how do you get the colors to pop like that and it's like it's actually  I'm just processing it a little bit with Snapseed. Yeah and the Snapseed interface makes it very easy

Transcript:  to turn up or down effects so you really you have a lot of control. I mean let me this is a picture  I just imported. It shows you a histogram. You could then choose your filters. There's tools  which allow you to things like crop rotate, spot repair, vignette and then there's filters  and here's the HDR scape. This is a good example so it's a good one. This lets you turn up or down  HDR as you choose and get it just right and then if and some of the things if you go up and down  yeah this one too you can choose different this is actually a great interface for a touch. So let's  say I want to change saturation. I can now turn that up or down so I just I really feel like they  kind of nailed it with this. It's interesting because these changes are all since Google  bought them. This is not the stuff that Nick did. This is stuff from Google. But Jason do you think  this is an opportunity because Apple has so badly fumbled iFotos. The iFotos to Photos transition

Yeah but you  don't feel like it's going to stay there for very long right? And a lot of people to be fair are  looking around for other options rather than jumping into Photos. But competition is really  interesting.

See was talking about these keyless entry systems of fobs that you use on your cars Nick built in was the first to bring this to our attention in the New York Times article where he said he was standing.  Outside his door of his house when he noticed kids getting one by one opening a door of every car all the way down the street getting in ransacking the car and leaving these are all locked cars including his own Prius.  They all had key everything now has keyless entry when I walk up to my car I I touch the handle the doors unlock and I get in that I press a button there's no.  there's no ignition key or anything like that so Steve explain how it works and apparently they are all vulnerable there's a $17 amplifier you can buy on.  eBay and I'm not sure I might have misremembered this I think you stand next to the car with this amplifier.  And then, or no I think it's the other way around it's next to the key fob with the amplifier and then your accomplice gets in the door because all of the only security on these key fobs is proximity.  That you have to be next to the car to get in, but if you could amplify it with this $17 amplifier then anybody can just open the doors open.  So your account so let's say you go to a fancy restaurant somebody notices hey that's a nice Aston Martin you're driving there he watches the valley parks it he follows him.  sees where the car is puts the key fob in that box his accomplice stands next to the box.  And you get in the car and drive off.

And then I thought about well your horse who was keeping people from stealing your horse nobody so it's only been since 1949 that you had the notion even that you could lock a car.  You didn't even have locks until 1949.  This honesty began in 19 honesty began in 1940 so really locks are just a suggestion a societal societal indicator that please don't go in here you're just trying to make it harder so that people don't bother that's really right is.  Well, this is hard if you have to get out you have to go to eBay you have to buy a thing you got to stand next to the fob it's too hard.  It's easier to see.

Transcript:  Jason.  Oh yeah.  So I just say the best thing.  I'm the best thing about that I like about Chromecast is that where you can put it on  a screen like especially in the office or and you can leave it on and it will flip pictures  or you can set it up there to pull like news headlines and photos and you know all kinds  of stuff.  So it's got the best sleep state of any.  I do.  I love it.  The device is out there.  I have my slideshow on there.  It's great.  And then you can.  It has that thing where even if you're not connected it has a little pin there where  you can say hey here's what you do to you know cast something up to this device.  I think it's a great shared.  It's the best sort of shared screen you know cord cutting kind of device this out there  and I love Apple TV too.  It's like you know of all the Apple products I'm probably the happiest.  I may be I'm like the only person on earth but it's like happiest with Apple TV.  But I mean any more now you can put those two devices on a TV and you know have an amazing  experience with a lot of content and a lot of capabilities of you know transferring things  from mobile devices to your to your screen and all that.  So I think both of them are you know I think underappreciated.  We're not alone Jason.

It's ready.  It's done.  It's cooked.  We're just doing a few behind the scenes wiring.  Unfortunately we so we were using it.  We're going to use a new player.  We use J.W. player which I know a lot of people have used before.  It's I think we decided that's the best player to use and we're paying for the next tier  up that gives you Chromecast support.  So if you're watching on the web this should be a little Chromecast button you can watch  on your big screen TV.  Unfortunately Jeff Needles did all the all the coding and he's gone.  So I don't know if we're actually going to be able to figure out how this how this works.  But I believe somebody somebody will figure it out.  Do you know how to use J.W. player.  Anybody.

Transcript:  And it sounds silly but you have to upgrade like every time I take my car for service  they ask me if I want to upgrade the maps because there have been times when the car  doesn't know exactly and I can call in and on the phone thing now.  But I don't want to listen to directions over the phone.  I just want it to work on my screen that I have.  So I can plug my phone into it and have it do it over the Internet like it's supposed  to.  You can call.  You can call and get directions.  They've got that on star.  On Star.  Hyundai has on your present.  So I call them when the map doesn't come up and automatically calls them.  Then they come down and say oh you're going to make a right.  I'm like get off the phone Lucy.  I'm just going to put my phone on the dashboard and keep it moving.

Although I have a problem with their coloring thing because if you're a red green colorblind  like some of us are it's very hard to tell whether the traffic is good or bad.  And Apple at least does that part right.  And there's where it's a dotted red line.  It's much easier to see.

I think I think in San Francisco area here Apple Maps is great.

So, you know, Veronica, who's so humble, you know, and so self-effacing has done so  many amazing things and, you know, has pretty much been, you know, on independent, primarily  independent since, you know, she was in her mid twenties and now she's kind of fully independent  doing lots of different gigs is, you know, in demand and, you know, is currently has  about, as we talk about in the chapter, about five different TV projects that she's kind  of pitching or, you know, in talks about and she's doing a new show in Engadget, right?  And she is doing a new show.  Yeah, that doesn't include.  Yeah. Ask Veronica.  That doesn't include the Engadget show.  So, you know, she's she she writes, you know, she can host.  She's hilarious.  And so, you know, she's such a, you know, such a talent and has really I think the example,  one of the things the book is really about, which is that the future of work is a lot  more entrepreneurial and people having to make work and as much as fine work and have  people, you know, come in and, you know, offering you work.  And it's kind of a combination of all those things.  And she's a perfect example of that.  She's a perfect example of kind of what we're talking about in the book and what we're  hoping that people get out of the book, which is ultimately figuring out ways to to deal  with the future where they may not have just the one full time job for a long time, where  they may have multiple gigs, where they may have to kind of hustle and and have to put  a career together based on all kinds of different gigs and different opportunities.  And making opportunities as well as finding them.  And so, you know, Veronica is she's such an amazing person and such a cool person.  Just and so she's she's great to talk to and just a good storyteller in her own right.  So she kind of made it easy with this chapter.  And I hope everybody will read it.  It'll be available for free for a couple more weeks.  You know, we release each chapter as we're done with them.  We release them for free on the Internet for for a few weeks until the next chapter comes  out. And then the book's also available for preorder.

Transcript:  Thanks a lot, United States Senate.  Well done.  You remember the we mentioned that the House of Representatives had passed by a  strong margin, a bill scrapping the NSA's bulk collection of phone data.  But of course, you know, in the way it works, as I remember from I think I'm just  a bill on Capitol.  I believe that after the House passes it, then the Senate must pass its version and  something to do with cloture and supermajorities.  They didn't.  And then they went home for the Memorial Day holiday.  Little credit to Rand Paul, who filibustered to prevent the renewal of the Patriot Act.  All of this kind of goes back to the Patriot Act.  Section 215 of the Patriot Act allows the mass of what Rand Paul?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because when you look at that, it's just the most childish in the country.  People don't understand these politicians get tons of money from lobbyists.  They don't care about you as an individual.  All they care about is money and power.  And it is just silly.  Rand Paul's sitting there and he's like, I object.  And the guy says January 5th, I object.  January 4th, I object.  January 3rd, I object.  January 2nd.  Hate the play.  Hate the game, my friend.  The senator from Mexico is like, well, can I object this time?  So it's not just Rand Paul saying he's the only person who objects like they're playing  a game and it's with people's lives and information and they do it with everything.  And it's so insane.  It makes me upset.  And I'm going to shut up now because I'm angry about it.  Continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I may have misunderstood this, but I understood.  I thought that the point was to keep the Patriot Act from being renewed.  It go, it expires June 1st.  Right.  And so he wanted to keep the vote off, put the vote off until recess.  It's an extended.  To extend, right.  Cause it has to be extended by vote.  So they didn't.  So good news, bad news.  They did say, well, forget that mass collection stuff, section 215.  But we still have some hope because they're going to come back just a few  hours, Mitch McConnell says, we're going to have like three hours on May 31st to  extend the Patriot Act.  He says he's the leader of the Senate.  We should extend it to protect our security.  I think a lot of us believe that the Patriot Act does nothing to protect our  security, but there's a lot to impinge on our privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel like that, that there's a, in the United States, there's kind of a, at this  point, uh, a sense that maybe the Patriot Act went too far.  No, look, nobody wants to be the person that passed or didn't pass a bill.  Then, then there's a terrorist attack the next day.  But, but I don't, I don't think that's the risk, but I, but I do feel like people  have feel like there's just, it's the NSA has gone way too far.

Start time: 4317.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the understanding these days is that, um, a lot of the provisions  in the Patriot Act, the people who voted for the Patriot Act right after the 9  11 attacks were not, well, and they weren't entirely aware of everything that was in  there, which again, that is their job, but it happened so fast that I think they even  complained they didn't get a chance to, to really investigate everything that was in  there.  And then of course, in the years since then, we've understood that the way some of  those provisions have been written, have been taken very broadly to do some things  that, you know, at the time, would we have signed up for that or not?  Maybe if we were scared in the aftermath of the attack, but you know, it's time has  passed down.  We've had 15 years or 14 years to think about this.  And, uh, you know, I, it's interesting that some people are saying, look, we just  can't do a blanket revision of this.  We need to, we need to talk about this stuff.

Transcript:  Well, so, so much is intractable in our government right now because the parties  just don't want to work together.  What's fascinating about this is that it's not breaking down on party lines.  This is a fascinating, it's a, it's a worldview thing where you've got people  like Rand Paul saying that this is ridiculous and people like Dianne Feinstein  saying, no, no, we need all of these provisions in there.  And so you've got, you've got things that are not attached to party lines.  Uh, she's a Democrat, he's a Republican, but he's a Libertarian Republican.

FCC has told ISPs, I think this is good, that if they have any doubts about how they  should protect broadband consumer privacy under the new net neutrality regulations,  you might want to ask us, the FCC.  They said they would be looking for good faith efforts to comply with privacy  protections.  Thank you.  But if you ask our input, that would show good faith.  The Title 2 common carrier law or regulations take effect June 12th, unless  there's a court stay.  And I don't, I don't, we haven't, it's been so quiet.  I don't know if there is, if there's anything going on.  So June 12th, for all the people who think like John C.  Dvorak, that at that point, the whole thing is going to go to hell in a hand  basket and we're going to have to get a license to podcast.  We'll see.  June 12th, it should happen.  But I, so far I'm, I like hearing the FCC saying, Hey, ISPs, you might want to  think about protecting your users privacy.  Because nobody had asked them that before.  Let's see.  I'm running, I'm rapidly running out of things.  Let me do another commercial.  If you guys see anything, look down the list of things.  Did you see that we are now on Spotify?  That's a good thing.

Transcript:  Um, so, so there's a company called slice.  You use every, I use a slice app.  The slice app is great.  It goes through your email.  It lets you know, uh, when your orders are coming and stuff like that, notifies you.  They also apparently are get gleaning information, which they then to tracking  us consumer spending and, uh, of course Apple sends you an email.  So if you're a slice user, as I am, you'll get a slice notification saying  your watch is on its way or whatever.  They say that, uh, according to the data they have, this is the graph,  the Apple watch sales huge day one.  The initial inventory sell off and the orders immediately fell and  have been flat ever since.  That is exactly the curve.  If you're a company you do not want to see.

Start time: 5058.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's, I think that's exactly what was expected.  There was huge pen up demand and then there was a, an available sale on day  one that was pretty good.  And now, and then the big problem is those day two sales every, every day  since then has been something that you're placing an order for a product  that you're not going to get for six to eight.

But that said, I've actually seen, I've been seeing real people wearing these,  you know, in Louisville, Kentucky.  I saw the checkout, the cashier checkout last night.  She was wearing one, asked her what she liked.  It loved it.  I saw two people the week after it came out.  I saw two people at a gardener's fair here in Louisville, wearing it, asked  both of them. The first one said absolutely was a, was a college kid.  He's a senior in college.  Absolutely loved it.  And he also had like the iPad or the, sorry, the iPhone six plus.  And so he said, you know, between the two of them, like it's, he does so much of  his computing, you know, that way now.  And it's all another guy.  Yeah.  And another guy who said that, you know, he loved it, but it just needs more apps.  And, you know, like I said, in my office, six people now are, we're up to six  people that have, I'm amazed at how many people they're buying.

Transcript:  Don't clarify me.  The bottom line is, is that Apple sells things.  And even though that chart looks the way it looks, reverse or forward or backwards,  they still sold more watches from Apple than other smartwatches are sold in like a  year, six months or whatever.  You see more people wearing Apple watches than you saw gear one, gear two, whatever.  So, and that essence is a success because regular people are buying it just to try  it because Apple said so.  It took Apple two years to sell 2 million iPods.

But look at all of this.  The funniest thing is Bill Clinton, when he sees the POTUS account, says,  welcome to Twitter POTUS.  One question.  Does that username stay with the office?  Hashtag asking for a friend.  These guys have mastered social media.  I got to say.  And then and then the president responds.  Good question.  Bill Quinton, the handle Bill Clinton, the handle comes with the house.  No, anybody interested in floaters, which would be the first lady's account.  Of course, Clinton would be if Hillary Clinton gets elected president, you know,  she's right.  I've heard she's running.  If you use Twitter, you can't help but see she's running and she's apparently  bought every Twitter ad forever.  Do you is that just me?  Or do you see that whenever you go to Twitter, the second post, it's always a  well, now it's T-Mobile and Taylor Swift and me.

You know, again, I'd rather you be in the streets preaching to your races than in  the weeds hide.  And I'd rather know where they're coming from.  But the thing that was crazy is people that just automatically sent this man  death threats.  And do you not know that the secret service, they're going to come knocking.  Yeah.  There's one guy, there's one guy who called the news and was reporting to  people.  They showed up at his house.  And of course he threatened to say something about kind of present and he's  a gun owner and all this kind of stuff.  But I'm like, dummy, just cause you make a fake, they're going to find you.  I talk about the NSA.  I guess they would find me.  Cause they found some of these guys with fake names and dummy emails and stuff.  And they showed up at everybody's doors.  They found them.

Transcript:  It seems, it seems a little weird to me that Twitter, I mean, it's a generic  like white house POTUS being totally generic.  There's an actual Barack Obama.  And if you're a successful presidential candidate, right?  Presumably you've got your own successful presidential Twitter account.  Maybe the one thing that I can figure is that there are some rules about what the  campaign can do versus what you can do when you're in office.  And so the idea is maybe, maybe Barack Obama, you know, at Barack Obama is the  camp is his front comes from his campaign and the next president would similarly  have to keep them separate.  But you know, now you've got white house and you're going to have POTUS plus  you've got whatever, whoever the next president is, their personal address.  Well, Hillary's got one.  Whoever it is.  It's confusing.  It's confusing.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Go ahead, Owen.  I'm sorry.  I said, and the next person steps in to be president, honestly, they're not going  to want to touch Twitter or any kind of social media because they're going to be  busy and you make one false step and you're slim Barack could come on there and  shoot threes all day and miss it.  Doesn't matter.  He's on his way out, but a new person coming in isn't going to hop on POTUS and  start making jabs at everybody and trying to be funny.  Like fool, you better run my country.  You ain't got time to be tweeting.  Anyway, that's kind of my feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, who knows how much Barack, you know, was really involved with, with this  launch and the only thing that I thought was sort of cool about it, it sort of  reminded me of, you know, that movie, the American president where Michael  Douglas plays the president and he's getting, he's taking hits all day from  this guy who's running against him, you know, and Aaron, Aaron Sorkin wrote the

Start time: 5785.42

Start time: 5790.46
End time: 5839.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, well, then he gets to his speech at the end, you know, and he sort of lays  into this guy and sort of, you know, reads him the riot act and it's all great.  But the last line of it, cause this guy, you know, in his, in his campaign speech  where he's dogging the president keeps saying, you know, my name is, I can't  remember what his name and, and I'm running for president.  And, and, and finally, you know, in the, in the speech where he's sort of, he's,  you know, unleashing all these zingers on, on this clown, he says, you know, my  name's Andrew shepherd and I am the president, you know?  And so that's kind of what POTUS reminds me of.  It's like, you know, lots of people can tweet and us, we were going to say stuff  and politicians are going to say, you know, they say dumb stuff all the time on  all kinds of on their own accounts.  And it's sort of reminding me like, here's the Twitter account from the president.  You know, and-

Transcript:  How important is Twitter to presidential politics, to elections?  I mean, you know, you see this has been going on for a while.  Clinton appears on our senior hall playing the saxophone when he was running for  president.  You see, you see MTV, you see presidential candidates show up on MTV.  It's part of wooing the electorate.  Is Twitter, is it kind of the, you've got to be there and you've got to be  interacting with viewers or what?  What do you call it?  Tweet your followers.

Start time: 5864.62
End time: 5902.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The media and people of our ilk would say, oh, why aren't you on Twitter?  You should be on Twitter.  But if you actually look at the way the country votes, younger people, no matter  how much MTV, no matter how much Shuck it and Java you do on our city hall, they  do not come out to vote.  Most of the people that vote in this country are over a certain age group and  they're probably not really on Twitter.  To my point of 2.3 million followers and a lot of those people probably, what if  a Republican gets in?  Is that number just going to drop off a cliff?  Because people really don't care what you're saying unless they're supporting  you.  So, you know, the people that vote aren't younger people right now.  They're not coming out in droves.

Start time: 5902.50
End time: 5919.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's the point.  One of the reasons that people go on MTV, candidates go on MTV is because they  were hoping to bring out, there's voters that you're not capitalizing on because  they don't vote.  If you can get them to the polls and voting for you, that could make a big  difference, right?  But is Twitter where young people go?  I don't think so.

Start time: 5920.96
End time: 5988.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who uses Twitter?  More so than Facebook.  I mean, it is, you know, it has a younger demo than Facebook does.  So, you know, I mean, I think, you know, I think Owen's right is it is a lot of  young people.  The only thing that I'd say to sort of keep in mind is, you know, that that  group that is on Twitter is probably that one that is swinging, right?  That it's the people that are not necessarily entrenched in, you know, one  side or the other.  Although you see plenty of, you know, political gamesmanship on Twitter.  But, you know, with that younger demographic, you know, it's people that  are probably less solidified in their political beliefs.  And so, you know, swing one way or another.  So I think that's probably the biggest benefit to Twitter is your chance to, you  know, to reach some of those swing voters who are, you know, who are there  and who you in every election, you know, those are the people that you have to  convince.  You know, you have to, you know, rally your base and get them to show up.  And then you have to get enough of that swing, those swing voters in the middle  to come over to your side.  Those are the two ways you win elections in presidential elections, you know, in  the United States.

Transcript:  And maybe you get 10% extra people from Twitter.  I mean, I know when Bill Clinton was on our studio hall, he stole my heart.  And from then on, I loved the dude.  He messed up a lot, but I just thought he was the coolest dude until Barack came  through and now Barack's the coolest president we've had.  But I do know that television presence that Bill Clinton did.  I was like, yo, just blow into the saxophone.  I ain't getting it.  Like you just thought he was a cool dude.  So there are things where you can swing people in or inspire someone to vote if  you do something the right way.  So I understand you got to put your nets, not all your eggs in one basket per se.  You got to put out, spread the eggs out and try and get new people in.  But in general.

And I really do wonder, I really do wonder if the POTUS account is there because  somebody, some lawyer said, you know, we should probably just have a, an office  of the president Twitter account because we all, every president is going to have  to keep it separate from their, from their campaign.

That means don't expect web TV from Apple for some time.  Uh, that is crazy talk, but if it didn't come from Peter Kafka on recode, uh, I  would, I would not, I would not credit it, but boy, these guys, uh, Peter and, uh,  Dawn, uh, Chmielewski definitely know what they're talking about.  Uh, industry executives familiar with Apple plans say that they're going to  individual cities, the individual broadcasters, local broadcasters, and they  want, if you have an Apple TV for you to be able to get your local station in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your area, it's easier than it used to be because one, um, so many more of the  affiliates are owned by the networks now that the, the regulations about how many  stations a network can own have been watered down to the point where you can  make a deal with ABC and pick up a huge number of ABC stations.  And then two, there's some infrastructure that has happened in the last few years.  Direct TV spent, I don't know, five or 10 years building out their local station  broadcasts where most, if not all, I don't know, most markets, uh, if you get  direct TV, you can get your local channels and that requires direct TV to  make a deal and get a feed.

The idea is, you know, if you want to be a cord cutter, but you still want to get  TV service over internet, you know, you probably don't want to slam the door on  your local CBS station or whatever.

Transcript:  And I feel like Apple has all the rumors of Apple TV coming out with a new  version in June.  Seems to me that Apple's finally just decided they're going to they're going to  do this all in public.  They're going to get the new hardware out there.  They're going to they're going to negotiate when people know it.  The element of surprise chasing the element surprise, I feel like has delayed  their Apple TV release potentially by a couple of years.  And I don't think they need to do it.  This is also maybe a sign of Tim Cook's Apple being a little more open about this  stuff and not feeling they need to drop this whole big mind blowing thing all at  once with everybody on board.  But instead, you know, just go back and do a piecemeal if they have to.

She says she's taken a little time to get used to the new keyboard, which has very  little travel, but it's it's thin.  Yeah, I mean, Acer Acer S7, which also was very thin and very little key travel.

Transcript:  That keyboard is amazing, though.  Do you like it?  I mean, I've been talking up Apple today, which is weird for me.  It is weird.  But yeah, Jason Snow knows.  But I love the keyboard on that on that 12 inch  MacBook. Yeah, I just did my review.  I released my review for you know, with professionals in mind using this thing.  And my review is basically that, you know, highly for highly mobile  business travelers and for kind of web workers.  This is just kind of the state of the art.  And that keyboard, I I literally am faster and more accurate on that keyboard.  Just that time of travel with that just a little bit less key travel.  You know, every one counts.  And I feel like I feel like I and I have measured it a little bit.  And I, you know, I am faster and because the keys are wider and there's less  space between keys, you know, I am a little more accurate on that keyboard.  I don't like force touch.  I deactivated it because is annoyed the heck out of me.

Start time: 6480.20
End time: 6484.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6484.74
End time: 6487.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 6488.04
End time: 6515.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't use that long press thing.  So it kept it messed up.  You know, when I was using to me too.  Yeah. Yeah. I tried to click and drag, you know, files into folders and the stupid  force touch thing would come up.  Right. So I hated that.  But I love the keyboard as far as, you know, the ports thing is kind of weird too.  And only having one port.  And but it does have great battery life.  So you don't necessarily it is sort of weird kind of unplugging your charger to, you  know, to plug in something for USB, like to plug in a USB.

Transcript:  I bought the silly $79 dongle.  Yeah, the dongle is a ridiculous price for that.  But it gives you it goes into this type C port and then gives you a regular USB port,  an H a full size HDMI and another type C so you can charge or or charge a phone.  You go it goes in both directions, which is kind of what I want.

Transcript:  I mean, it's cool because now you're going to be able to go and charge this off like  one of the battery battery packs like you use to charge your phone.  Right. That's one of the biggest, the coolest things about it.  But I also felt like this this machine I love the 11 inch MacBook Air.  And so that's what Jason's using right now.  Yeah. I mean, so this thing was I'm sort of the ideal candidate for for this machine.  And it is impressive that they got the Retina display in there, you know, at 12 inches,  because it's basically the same size as the 11 inch, just a little bit wider and just  a little bit more narrow and obviously thinner.  But it's a very similar form factor in the fact that they got the Retina display in  there and it doesn't hit battery life because I still get nine or ten hours.  I get through a coast to coast flight on that thing easily, you know, with with no

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't like the keys, though, if you compare them to the 15 inch, they're bigger.  The keycaps are bigger.  The keycaps are bigger. Should be easier to keyboard.

End time: 6676.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are easier to hit. They're more stable.  They make a loud noise when you press them.  They do. They are loud.  It's very loud.  But there's also a lot less travel.  And when I talked to Apple about this, when I was writing my review, they said, look,  we know that the reduced travel is a compromise.  They admitted it, which believe me, they don't they don't usually do that when they  they don't usually admit compromises.  But they said in exchange for that, we try to do a lot of other things like the new  mechanism that we use in the bigger keycaps and all of these other things to try and  offset the reduced travel.  And it does a little bit.  But in the end, for me, it's that losing that travel, it just I don't like the feel  of it. But that's a personal choice.  Everybody who talks to me about getting one of these, I say, go, go to the Apple store  and give it a try and see if you might like it or not, because for some people it's  fine and other people will hate it.

Transcript:  I actually kicked in on this Kickstarter hub plus thing.  I hope they got funded.  I'm hoping it now.  See, this is what's interesting, because Apple has for the first time in living memory  chosen a standard, which is so that means you don't have to go somebody get a magsafe  or whatever. You can just go to Monoprice and get the cheapest dongles made because  type C is standard.  This this company, Hub Plus, is going to make something that plugs into the type C and  gives you another type C.  A looks like a mini display port, another full size USB, an SD card reader.  This thing's crazy.  And it's colored to match.  They say it'll be out in June.  I don't I find that hard to believe, but maybe they've already made it because the  Kickstarter project itself still has three weeks to go.  They've raised their goals.  Thirty five thousand. They raised four hundred and eleven thousand two USB ports, an SD  card reader, mini display port, three USB three charging ports.  And it's got a battery in it so you could use it to charge your phone.  Yeah, that's crazy.  It's pretty clever. I immediately ordered one because I'm a complete sucker.  I believe anything I read on Kickstarter, I believe.

Transcript:  One thing on Apple TV.  So if we could go back to that, just go back to Apple TV, anywhere you want to go.  Cool. Because so I've heard the same thing that it is not likely to be released.  You know, it's more that it probably has been delayed till the fall.  They'll talk about it, certainly it in some way or another, I would think, at WWDC.  But I, you know, I've been hearing that it's probably going to be delayed till the fall.  And the interesting thing, one of the reasons that that probably matters is because of  HomeKit. You know, that's another thing that we're talking about.  You know, that was going to be the hub, wasn't it?

Start time: 6791.64
End time: 6792.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or at least we thought it might be.

Start time: 6792.72
End time: 6891.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So in one way or another, it's going to be there's going to be important ways  that HomeKit integrates with it.  Not exactly sure what the details of that will be, of course, but it could be that it's  part of the security package.  It could be that it's the hub so that you don't need another hub.  You know, all these with all these home security things, you need some kind of hub like  with Wink or SmartThings or, you know, Belk and Mimo, these others.  You know, it's the Wild West with home automation and smart home connected home stuff  right now. And so, you know, Apple's going to make a big play is making a big play with  that with HomeKit. Google, we're likely going to hear what their play is.  I think in the end, it probably is.  Microsoft, too, don't forget.  And Microsoft, too.  But I do think in the end and Microsoft has a leg up in the sense because of Xbox, there  are already a lot of Xboxes, you know, in the home.  So maybe they could turn the Xbox somehow into into a hub.  But I think it's more likely that that Apple and Google become big players in this,  you know, because mobile is going to be huge in using mobile to to interact with with  the smart home. And so it's going to be really interesting to watch.  And just just people keep should keep in mind with the Apple TV thing that HomeKit is,  you know, that they are they are riding shotgun on whatever happens with Apple TV.  You know, the local TV thing is important, but also it's got an important function for  whatever their HomeKit plans are as well.

Because you go back and you think of the assumptions,  you see the assumptions that they had then, which was like, OK,  these guys are flying.  That means this is the way everybody's going to travel.  It was kind of like the flying car thing.

Transcript:  Well, so I started out real Android Wear has a much easier on-ramp.  I'll be honest, especially if you're already in the Android ecosystem.  Much, much easier on that.  Much simpler.  But it does a lot less.  Right.  So it's so weird to also in that way.  Whereas the Apple Watch is much more capable, much more customizable, much more.  This is usually the argument we make opposite for both these platforms.  Right.  But at the same time, you know, the Android Wear, I do have some issues with I had some  performance issues where with Android Wear, whereas I did have a little bit more smoothness,  a little better reliability with the Apple Watch.  But there are things that like about both platforms.  And so I talk about those two things in terms of which one, whether I'm going to wear one  long term and which one, you know, I'll sort of save that for for when the review comes  out also because I'm still finishing it.
