[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   Boy, I think this is the biggest panel we've ever had.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   And it's not full yet.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   There are more people still to come.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   Let me introduce everybody.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.800]   I'll start from my right here with the great Robert Herron.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   Hey, hello there.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   It's good to see you again.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   Robert's an original Twitter.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   Oh, it's good to be here.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   I'm very beginning.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   I'll see you as treating you.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   It's great.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   You do home theater, so we'll talk a lot about big screens in just a little bit.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   Awesome.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   His company is Herron Fidelity.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   It is.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   Yep.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   And you still do a HD Nation on as part of Tekzilla these days.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   Exactly.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   Also, if we slide the mic to the right, because we have to share Mike's,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   Becky Worley from ABC News is here and TNT, of course.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   Hi, Becky.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Great to be here with you.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   And you did this the best CES ever.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   It's my best CES ever.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   No joke.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   I don't believe it will find out.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   I'm not just being perky.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   I'm just having a great time.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   She turned down the hair.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   I read her Facebook.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   She said, "I realized I was being defensive and doing the helmet hair thing."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   Don't use hairspray as a crutch.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   It's not a good idea.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   She almost poked my eye out.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   That's what Schuud's here for.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   We'll see that in a moment.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   First, let's go to table two and Tom Merritt.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   Good to have you.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   TNT.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   He's been doing a great job here, TNT and everything else covering the show floor.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   That's CES now.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   It feels like it doesn't have my life before this.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   Me neither.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   That's actually a true feeling.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   There really is.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   Have we always been here?
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   It's only the third day.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   You understand?
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   That's not too clear.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   Actually, your fourth day, my third.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Sarah Lane is here.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   Thank you for being here.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Sarah Lane, also from TNT and iPad today.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   She doesn't need your mic.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   She has her very own.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   I got my mic.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   I think so.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   She also has the largest laptop.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   I do.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   It's a 17-inch laptop, the largest laptop in the land.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   That's only because the guy to your left didn't bring his Brian Brushwood.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Rocket the iPad.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   Hey, it's my first CES ever.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   Is this?
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Oh, we're going to get a CES.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   We're going to see how it feels to have your cherry popped in Vegas in just a little bit.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   That's actually good.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   Now, we need to have one person who's never been here before to kind of give us some perspective.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   All right.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   I Justine is also here.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   Justine is Eric.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   I justine.com.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   You don't need a computer.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   I got my mini iPad.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   You're set the mini iPad.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   That's all you need.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   It's great to have you here, Justine.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   You.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   You were working for Spike for a little bit.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   I've been using a new GT-TV to do a new tech segment.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   You're the tech reporter?
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   Yes.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   That's fantastic.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   I saw you sitting in a very cool, was it Trans Am or something?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   I was a needle guard.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   I don't know.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   I don't know.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   I'm not either.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   But it was nice.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   It was nice.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   And to your left, and I think the last person so far anyway, and we don't have enough.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   Oh, the lens isn't, oh, there it is.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   Oh, hi.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   Most likely, Lisa Fettany, who will be the host of a new show on Twitch starting this month,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   I think.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   Very soon.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   But I think mostly photography or something like that, it's going to be a photography show
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   with Lisa Fettany and me, and it's going to be great.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   It's going to be awesome.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   I can't wait.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   So let me ask the newbie, Mr. Brian Brushwood.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   Yes, sir.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   Anybody else for CES?
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   Me.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   Lisa Tooty.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   Wow.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   Okay, we got two newbies.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   It's not just me who's having their best CES ever.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   Yeah, they're having their best CES ever also.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   I'm not going to lie, I'm having my best CES as well.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   Really?
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   I feel like there's a different vibe.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   Maybe I just have more friends here or something.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   I'm not really sure, but I feel like there's just a lot of people here and I don't know.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   Gary Shapiro tell you, Tom Ayr, this is the largest CES.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   He couldn't confirm it yet, but they expected it to be.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   He said they expected it to have 160,000.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   And the previous big one was 143,000 in 2007.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   Well, if you ever want to measure that the tech industry is on the march, despite the
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   continuing bad economy, it's obvious this is huge.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   Every other trade show's dying.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   You know how many people came to the very first CES?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   How many?
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   17,000.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   And you know that because you talked to a really, really old guy.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   Jack Wayman, the founder of the CES.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   That was so cool.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   That was a great interview.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   He's a wonderful man.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   Has he been to every CES?
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   He said originally it was what?
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   It was about TV and radio?
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   It was radio.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   Radio.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   Pre-television.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   Wow.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   It's Chicago.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   In Chicago.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   By many years.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   And he was saying they were trying to just cut out the middle man.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   Right.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   And get the people who ran the small shops, the delt and the stuff, because there weren't
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   big best buys back then, to actually be able to have connection with the manufacturers
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   and get the good stuff and make good deals so that they could make more money.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   He said also at that time it was a really big deal to get Japanese manufacturers any
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   visibility in the States at all.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   At that time, Japanese stuff was junk.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   Now it's-
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   That was what it was considered.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   Now it's the best stuff that started.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   So Brian, what do you think?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   I gotta tell you, it's a little bit like a Franken-convention.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   I mean, it's so big and it's such a wide, you've got gaming peripherals, you've got automotive,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   you go to the central area, it's like, you know, it's like an e-three style, larger than
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.800]   life thing and you go to the bottom of the south hall, you find-
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   It's so big that there are people who buy booths just so there's traffic.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   There's people selling drill bits just because you know that there's a lot of people walking
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   somebody's gonna want to drill bits.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   Somebody's gonna want to drill bits.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   I'm gonna drill bit.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   I'm gonna drill bit around here.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   It's very overwhelming and I find myself, I found myself really not into any of the big
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   announcements.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   The stuff, I mean, I was glad to cover this stuff in the central hall, but my favorite part
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   of the entire experience was finding the quirky bizarre stuff here in the south hall.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   All the small booths where you could tell-
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   I agree.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   -to a lot of people- That's really fun.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   Spending their own money to have these outrageous ideas.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   I'll tell you, my favorite item I've seen so far are the speakers that you screw into
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   your lamps.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   Wow.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   That-
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.800]   Their self-powered because they powered through the lamp, they 2.4 gigahertz, 18 channels,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   so it always sounds good and they're just speakers everywhere.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   In every lamp.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   In every lamp.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   In that great?
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   It's dark, but it sounds great.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   And you're flugging the-
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   Oh, you're still gonna plug in a ball course.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   It's like a pass through thing.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   Lisa Benney, a lot of photography stuff here.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   Is that why you're here?
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   No, you're here for the Mashable Awards.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   I was here for the Mashable Awards.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   How was that?
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   It was great.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   It was the first sort of big to do that they had.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   And who were the big winners of the Mashable Awards?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   Well, my favorite was Antoine Dodson.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   That's what I thought.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   That's what I thought.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   That's what I thought.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   He really- there was sort of a lull in the show and he came out and just-
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   everyone was laughing.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   He sang his new- his new single.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   What's his new single?
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   That's something to do with hide and something.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   This guy has actually made a career for himself out of that.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   Yeah, well, he's being paid for appearances.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   I mean, he was paid to be at the show.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   And I mean- I think he had aspirations of this before there was an
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   incident in his apartment building.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   This is the one where they-
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   And he just happened to get on-
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   His sister's-
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   His sister, right?
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   His rapist in Lincoln Park.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   And he could tell he kind of enjoyed the camera time.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   It became a- was it- was it the brothers that made the-
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   It was the Gregory brothers.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   It was the Gregory brothers.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   Would you hardly ever hear anyone mention now?
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   Everyone knows what he was talking about.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   Antoine, I know.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   That's amazing.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   That's kind of not fair, really.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   I mean, it's the Gregory brothers, really, who made him a star.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   Let's give them their dude.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   He was the raw material.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   The book for news had happened before they made a song out of it.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   So, I mean-
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   But I gotta say, I gotta say,
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   anybody who tries to do a sequel to a viral video is doomed to failure.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   I remember the- what was the- the-
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   Jada Uma Uma guy.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   No, Jada's done pretty well.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   But the new one Uma guy tried to make a sequel to it.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   That was horrible.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   Antoine did do a Christmas segment.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   He was talking about Santa coming down to Jimmy,
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   but he's like in Lincoln Park, you'll be coming to my heater.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   I'm like, "Oh my god."
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   Jimmy intruder.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   It's called Jimmy intruder.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   Did Jimmy intruder?
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   I don't think that one went over-
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   Will he have to have a truder in all of his songs now?
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   Is that-
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   I think he'll expand.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   Yeah, there's potential.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   I mean, he has- he's got his own YouTube channel.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   I mean, he's been doing live shows.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   I watch it.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   That's bizarre.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   He was very humble though.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   He was a very nice person.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   Well, he's gotta be kind of surprised by all of this attention.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   Yes.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Well, oh, in the double rainbow guy was there.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   Oh my god.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   No!
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   Well, both of him-
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   Oh!
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   All the way!
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   Okay, Sarah.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   All right.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   I can't sit by idly anymore because until about what was it?
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   Until our Christmas party, I didn't know anything about it.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   I had made a reference to what does it mean at our Christmas party when we were at Book of
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   Beppo and Leo went, what?
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   I don't know.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   You could just tell him he didn't get the reference.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   What does it mean?
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   I thought he was talking about the double rainbow ice cream.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   And I was like, oh, you know, I'm making a double rainbow joke.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   And he goes, double rainbow the ice cream.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   I said, what?
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   In the world?
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   So we played it on the Twit Live.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   Now I know.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   I think later.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   And he was like, well, this is weird.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   I'm just catching up.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   I felt tuning in.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   I felt tuning in.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   I was like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:50.800]   Yeah, totally digging in it. The Lopstrosity scared me a little bit. I'm sure you feel that way.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   Yeah, there that well, I was a little stunned. I don't want to know spoilers, but when you first meet them what they do, I was like,
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   wait, wait, this is only the second volume.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   I'm like, wow, he's like, this is a Stephen King. How many is it eight volumes?
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   Seven seven volumes to the book, but he's working on the eight. He's got to realize that he all of his other books or many of his other books are actually about the dark tower.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:16.800]   He's the spine of Stephen King's entire. He calls it his Jupiter, the round which all the other ones orbit.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.800]   So you got to, for example, you got to read Insomnia and the Stand. All those are directly related to this.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   Well, you got me hooked. I love these. What I've been doing is spreading it out. I'm listening to Keith Richards' life right now, which is a fantastic book.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   Johnny Depp starts it some English guy named Hurley gets the middle part, then Johnny Depp comes back and away.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   Oh, really? That's awesome. It's really, really great. Anyway, there's about 18 different things.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   Do you use the app when you listen? I do. Do you have that? Do you check your badges? You're getting badges. Look at how many badges do you have?
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:50.800]   I've got the, I've got binge listener. High noon, weekend warrior.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   What's all night? All night or? It's awesome. You get a lot more badges than I have. You've listened for at least eight hours at night.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:02.800]   See if there's audible asleep, audible apps for Android and iPhone and they have badges. It's really, really great.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:06.800]   And for falling asleep, they actually have a timer so you can send it. So if you use it all the time, you don't lose it a lot.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:11.800]   If you haven't started on your audible jag, I think now by now you know why you need to use audible.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:16.800]   I didn't know about the badges. So I think I need to start listening to these messages.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   Audible badges. We're going to compare four square badges a little later on, but let me just finish this ad up and say audible.com/twit2
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.800]   offer good in the US and Canada, but don't worry, there's audible all around the world.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   And we do invite you to give it a try. Audible.com/twit2, I want to tell you what the offer is.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:41.800]   First month's free. So you sign up and get your first month three. That's two books. That'll get you right into any one of these series.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   Two of the void trilogy, two of the Dark Tower series. If you don't want to get hooked on audible, don't start with those.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   What's it's about to say, isn't there some other business where the model is gift the first one to free?
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.800]   First month's charging? The first two?
[00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:02.800]   That's what it is. That's what I'm thinking. Audible.com/twit2, we do thank them so much for their support of us.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   We do audible ads mostly because we love audible so much. We'd be doing the ads anyway.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   Alright, time to talk about your favorite from CES. Mostly Lisa, this is your first CES.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.800]   Honestly, I'm going to say I was really influenced by just seeing and I have to say it's the connect.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   You like the connect which wasn't even announced in CES.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   I follow her and I've been seeing how much fun she had.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.800]   What's your favorite game? Yeah, what were you playing?
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.800]   Dance Central of course.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.800]   I mean, I like to move it. Move it. Move it.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.800]   They have the stupidest moves. Torch. What is that?
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.800]   That's my favorite. I was at an after party for the Mashable Awards and there were some people doing that in real life.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.800]   No, they were doing the Dance Central dances. That's only a matter of time, isn't it?
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.800]   So you're doing the Lady Gaga telephone. It's telephone, right?
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.800]   Or no, it's which is the song that has, I can't remember now.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.800]   Poker face. You're doing poker face. Yeah, we both, it's funny. I did poker face too.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   What do you dance to just, Justine?
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   What is it? Teach me how to jerk.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.800]   Oh, that's your favorite? Okay, I got to try that one.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.800]   So this is the 21st century version of line dancing. We all dance around.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   Do our dance. It's so, who has time? You dance it.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   Do it, I know. It's so funny because, you know, I don't know if you've done this with Pete, but I'm doing the thing, you know.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   And then somebody will, like, my kid will come and stand next to me to say, "What are you doing?"
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:34.800]   And I have to, like, "Get out of here. Get out of here. You're gonna ruin it. I'm in the middle of a role."
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   And they say, "Daddy, don't you love me anymore?"
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.800]   Bringing families together. It's so great.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.800]   Just in the YouTube video where the mother was playing and you hit the kid in the face.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   Amazing.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.800]   Our dogs always jump up and get in the way because they're like, "Oh, you're playing!"
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.800]   "No, you're with you."
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.800]   I think, I can, I can, I can connect really, I mean, it's two months old now, eight million.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   But it really is, I have to say, probably one of the top products of the year.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   It's the most, I mean, when you're walking around, there's so many things that you can sort of look at, but that's something that you can actually participate in.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   Interact.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   There's a booth here where somebody is showing something very similar and they're showing controlling Netflix and other things with it.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   There's a couple of them.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.800]   So I think that technology is going to emerge.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   I'm still waiting for minority report.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   Also, if you're on the, if you're on the CES floor and you go to the Marvell booth, apparently they have a connect you can play with and nobody's there because no one realizes Marvell, who makes the chip that goes in the connect, would have gaming.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.800]   So there's no line.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   Go check it out.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:28.800]   I'm pretty sure that company who heard it.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.800]   I think you just ruined that tone.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   Putting it one out for the PC as well.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800]   Oh, that would be interesting.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.800]   Yeah, Steve Bummer said they definitely would like to bring the connect to the PC.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   Yeah, very interesting.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   And I have to say, in terms of the success of the connect, I don't know if any of the console accessory that's got like a 20% adoption rate amongst existing users.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   Out of the box.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.800]   It's all got almost 10 million connect.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   Out of the box.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   50 million Xbox 360.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   That's like an insane number.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   I mean, I got the PlayStation move when it first came out.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   It was like, this is the coolest thing ever.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.800]   Stupid.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.800]   I know.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   I know.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.800]   And then I got the connection never touched.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.800]   There's a machine gun, a move machine gun on the floor.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.800]   It's a machine gun with a glowing green ball.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   With a stupid ping nose on the front of it.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   It really takes the fun out of it.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   It was so fun, though.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.800]   I just team, now this is yours?
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   First, no.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   No, I don't even know how many I've been to.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   You've been to me.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   A few.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   A few.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   A few.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800]   A few.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.800]   A few.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   A few.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   A few.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   A few.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.800]   A few.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   A few.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   A few.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   A few.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   A few.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   A few.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.800]   I was actually really impressed with it because I was like, oh, this is really stupid.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   But it was not.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   And it takes the place of having surround sound.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   Right.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.800]   Just out of one city box.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.800]   How does one speaker give you 3D sound?
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800]   Computers.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800]   No, there was like--
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800]   More specifically.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800]   I know computers are about--
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   I know computers are about--
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.800]   I know computers are about--
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.800]   In these speakers.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.800]   Now, I think the chip made--
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.800]   You only have two ears, you know, dear.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800]   It was really cool.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   Think about it.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   Well, they've had single bar surround sound for a long time.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800]   What's the difference to that?
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   That's what I was curious about.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   I think--
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   What's the difference between this and that?
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   With the surround sound, you have to be in certain places.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.800]   They're getting very effective at simulating entire spheres so something can come up here,
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   down here, over here.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   It is pretty impressive, I'll--
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   It brings me out, actually.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   Do you know a name for the company?
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   Do you remember off the time you were in?
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   I just look in the right picture.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   It's like, hair or something?
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   H-A-I-R?
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   Oh, higher.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   H-A-I-E-R, higher.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   You're right.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   Yup.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   Sonic Emotion.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   Mmm.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   Brian Brushwood.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   What's your top of show?
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.800]   It was awesome getting to meet and see the Maker Bots.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800]   They're moving like that.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   Breeds, I love that it's made out of wood.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.800]   This guy is a hit.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.800]   In fact, I talked to Breed, he said, "I make something out of wood."
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   Yes.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   And it's on the show floor, it's winning awards.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   What's going on?
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   It's awesome.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   And I think that's part of why I love it is because it's a genuine self-made success story.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   But as far as gizmos that I really dig, I loved seeing everything at the Razer booth.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   First of all, they have their Hydra controller, it's super precise.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   And you just pulled one in each hand and they were running a build of Portal 2 that allowed
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   you to grab objects, manipulate them, elongate stuff and throw it down.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.400]   But their most novel object, unfortunately, is just a prototype, is their Switchblade,
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.600]   which is a netbook that can run, for example, World of Warcraft.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.320]   The entire screen is a touch screen.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.000]   All of the buttons have LED or LCDs underneath them, so they animate it.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   And so what they're going to do is they're going to redefine the UI.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Because right now, for example, if you're playing World of Warcraft, you have to watch
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   the little icon on the screen glow until finally the time you can cast the spell.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   Because these cells, they become the icons and they're all remappable.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   You can play them on their ideas.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   They said they'll have them, that'll be always on the internet.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   So while you're on the subway, while you're on the bus, you've got your always on MMO,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   you can escape to a whole other world.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   That can be cool.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   I like that as a product.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   It's really nifty looking.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   It's called the Razer Switchblade.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   It's called the Razer ZER.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   Correct.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   Thank you, Brian.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   Sarah Lane, you're looking a little foggy.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   It's been a long fact.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   I'm not looking at foggy.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   I'm foggy.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   Maybe it's just projected.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   I feel okay.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   I'm up.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   No, actually, I was thinking, "What was my favorite?"
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   I think I have to just be honest.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   This is always the hardest question, because it's hard to pick one thing.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   It's hard to remember all the things you saw.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   That too.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   I think what I ended up finding is, I kept gravitating towards the North Hall in the cool car section,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   because sometimes the electronics just all start looking the same to me, but cool cars are still really cool.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   There were some beautiful cars on the floor, all the things.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   Some beautiful cars.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   And Tom and I just kind of by accident yesterday ran into some of the new Sony Pandora-equipped
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   in car stereos.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   Yes.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   And there was one specific, I think it's the DSX S100, which looks like a CD dash, but it's
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   actually a dash that comes out.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   You put your iPod or your iPhone inside it, then it's just everything is tucked away,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   and through your car interface you can actually control the stereo that has Pandora enabled.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   That's kind of like--
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Any of your Pandora stations now?
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   Aftermarket sync, almost.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   Yeah, it's really-- that was awesome.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   I was like, you know, of all the things I've seen, I would really, really use this tomorrow in my car all the time.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   You didn't think Sfiro was the best thing you saw?
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Sfiro was awesome.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   That was awesome.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   Sfiro was awesome.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   Sfiro was awesome, but I think I would use it on a daily basis quite a bit less.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   Never.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   Or maybe never.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   I haven't seen this, Sfiro.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   What is this?
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   Sfiro is a Bluetooth ball.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   It's awesome, of course it is.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   It's like an electronic hamster enabled ball that you roll with an iPhone or iPad or Android
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   app.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   Watch iPad today this weekend.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   You'll see Sweet Demetstrated.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   It's modern, Bauchy Ball.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   It's the ultimate cat entertainment series.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   And that, I hadn't even thought about that.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   Oh, now you like it.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Now you can think of it as my son.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   I think of it as my son.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   She's like in a, anything with a cat in it.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Thank you, Sarah.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Tom Merritt, your pick of the week.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Like I said, it's hard to remember all of the stuff you see.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   And then people ask you all the time, "What's your favorite thing you've seen so far?"
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   So every answer starts to sound cliche.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   I know.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   But for those of you listening to the show who haven't heard me go off and about it,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   there was a wall of devices where you just put your food inside and close the door.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   It's called the refrigerator.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   Press a couple buttons and it cooks the food.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   No.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Without using any heat.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   A micro updates your Facebook status?
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   I saw it over at the RC.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   No, it just cooks your food.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   It tweets on your behalf.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   No, it just cooks your food.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   It just cooks your food.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   Just cook it evenly.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   Yeah, well, not one side would cook more than the other.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   Some of them will rotate the food for you.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   It's not a removable tablet.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   That is genius.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   No, it just cooks your food.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   He thinks it's CES 1967.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   No, I actually brushed it when I went by the RCA booth and they had a huge wall.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   They had a micro wave at the RC.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   They had the booth.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   Eight or nine of them.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   Are they nuts?
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   This is like Tweeter friend of the year.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   Oh, let's spend a lot of this priceless RIA state on microwave oven.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   GE's back here.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   Ken Moore's here with washer and dryer.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   Samsung is bright.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   Let's not forget Reese's.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Can I get a refrigerator?
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   We've got to get Chris Perillo.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   If we can get him over here, he's a spokesman for Reese's peanut butter.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   They have the new technology.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   They have the new technology of smaller bits of Reese's.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   With no wrappers, so they're easier to pop into your mouth.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   Right.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   They're eco-friendly and they're mini.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   In all seriousness, I think about four bags of them.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   I did too.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   They're actually quite good.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   Got to go back.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   It's about that time.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   I was disappointed when they weren't in our lunch party.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   I actually added an entire Chris Perillo to my weight.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   Oh, so not that bad.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   No, not that bad.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   My favorite thing was the Atrix laptop dock.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   Interesting.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   Where you take the Atrix smartphone that's come out from Motorola.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   It's one of the dual core phones.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   We were talking about it earlier.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   And you dock it in a keyboard and monitor.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   So that you've got a full on computer access.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   You've got a netbook with you.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   But you still also have the option of pulling it out and using it as a phone.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   And yeah, I know I could just carry around an iPad or a camera laptop.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   But I think that's an incredibly flexible option where it's like,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   you know what, I just want to carry my phone.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   But I can fold up that keyboard and slide it in a briefcase.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   It's a whole lot easier than carrying around a big old tablet.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   It's a whole lot lighter too.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   Well, I do have to say I'm very interested in these super high-power phones.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   And the idea of a two gigahertz phone.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   And with that dock you can play games.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   You can do multitasking.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   It has a touchpad on the bottom.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   And it's got a real keyboard.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   It's the kind of keyboard you'd see on a thinkpad.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   So it's sad to say that was the most impressive thing for me.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   There really wasn't anything that blew me away here.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   But I liked it.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   I wish we had Robert Herron still here in Becky Warley.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   But they'll have to phone in their best-to-show.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   Fortunately, we have Patrick Norton here.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   What was your best-to-show, Patrick?
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   I'm finally getting to the point where I can feel my wrists again.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   I don't know if anybody else here types for a living.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   But a company called Smartfish with a Smartfish Engaged Keyboard.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   It's like a motorized keyboard.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   And I know most of the ergometric keyboards are a joke.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   But this one actually moves like every 2,400 keystrokes.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   It cycles through four positions.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   Oh, wow.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   And by doing that, it actually prevents you from placing too much stress on your wrist.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   And I'm still trying to, like, dual-core mobile phone.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   No.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   I've got races.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   Where did that come from?
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   I don't know.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   I think Chris Frill is on my table.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   Share your stash, man.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   All right.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   I'm always going to start talking really fast in a couple minutes.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   That's good.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   I'm still going to blow away the forward-announcing the electric car here rather than its seamen.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   I have to say, if Ford were not a sponsor, I would say that the electric fork is absolutely
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   my pick of the show.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   I cannot wait to get one, but it won't be for a year.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   I know.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   But I'm like, I got in the focus.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   Have you gotten in?
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   This is a beautiful car.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   I've driven, like, 100 miles in the Ford Focus.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   It's not the 2012.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   The 2012.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   I've been in the 2012.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   You have driven the Swaycon.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   You son of a bitch.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   How'd you do that?
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   It's part of the global drive campaign.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   We did the whole thing with it.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   But you're not getting to go to Madrid.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   No.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   No.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   Actually, film riots going to Madrid.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   They asked me to go to Madrid, and I said, I can't go.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   Dvorak's going to go instead.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   What?
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   Is that horrible?
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   Is that a nightmare?
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   Dvorak will appreciate the food.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   Oh, he's very-- oh, yeah.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   He said, oh, yeah.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   There's three-- you know what he said?
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Oh, yeah.
