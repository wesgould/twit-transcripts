[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.600]   horrible, no good, very bad day.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.560]   Reviews of all the new Surface hardware.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.280]   And then, can Coca-Cola save the world
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.000]   and destroy video games?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.520]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.520]   On Twit.

[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.680]   Biggest stories, they're all big this week.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.240]   I'm going to tell you, with the best tech journalists
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.080]   in the biz, Daniel Rapinos here from Windows Central,
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.600]   it's great to have you as always, Daniel.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.800]   I guess it's been a busy week.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.240]   Brand new version of Windows coming out.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.720]   Something fun.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.640]   Yeah, it has been busy.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.800]   It's funny, of all the big, big stories to cover,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.280]   it seems like Windows 11 is one of the smallest.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.760]   But we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.280]   Also some brand new Surfassi.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.920]   With us also from Microsoft, herself, Christina Warren.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.240]   Always great to see the senior cloud advocate for Microsoft,
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.120]   who has been grounded thanks to COVID.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.560]   Thank goodness.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.640]   I think you were going to burn out.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.160]   Probably.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.920]   Although I miss it, man, I can't wait to get back in the air again.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.760]   Ignite is not on the road, right, this year?
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.040]   It is not.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.480]   It's November, and it'll still be virtual.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.800]   When do you think you'll be doing the impersonation?
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.760]   I don't know.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.160]   I mean, I hope next year.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.080]   But I mean, it's also up in the air, right?
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   We are tentative, come back to the office state.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.600]   I mean, they've actually stopped giving us a tentative--
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   They finally gave up.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   Yeah, they're like, look, we'll tell you,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.840]   we're not going to-- because they
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.960]   kind of have to push things back.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.080]   And it'll probably be January, February.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.760]   Hopefully, things will be better.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360]   You were supposed to come back this week, actually,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.720]   as I was--
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.680]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   I think you're right.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.080]   And probably a month plus ago, they were like--
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.560]   No, things are looking up, though.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.760]   I have to say, this is the first time I've
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.600]   felt hopeful in quite some time about the virus.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.080]   It seems to be that we're turning the table
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.840]   across the country, which is really good.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   Also with us, great to see Dan Morin.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.880]   He's our Apple Guy, sixcolors.com.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.080]   Great to have you, Dan.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.760]   Pleasure to be here.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.040]   Apple had a little-- Apple owned last week.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.560]   Right.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.320]   They have to sit back down.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.920]   Take a week off.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.800]   Take a week off.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.240]   Yeah, because, yeah, that's actually my first question.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.960]   Don't they have some laptops to announce?
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.920]   What are they going to do that anytime soon?
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   Yeah, I mean, I think the guess is sometime--
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.920]   I mean, October seems a pretty solid
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.920]   that probably not next week since the--
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.280]   I know the Pixel event is coming up on a Tuesday,
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.680]   which is Apple's traditional day.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.040]   So probably that last Tuesday, it
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.240]   seems like, which is also right before their quarterly earnings
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.600]   call.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.040]   So that seems like a pretty good point to this.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.520]   It's a good place to test the 26.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.080]   Yeah, I would say the 26.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.840]   Yeah, that's my bet.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.840]   Yeah, we're going to be doing the Pixel 6.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.960]   We'll do a live stream, Jason, Hal and I on the 19th.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   That's a week from Tuesday.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.240]   Apple usually sends that in but it's a week ahead of time.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.320]   So I'm thinking we'll-- that day also
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.840]   get an invite for a 26th event.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.440]   That makes sense.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.640]   Thank you, Dan, for clarifying all that.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   Happy to help.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.520]   Christine and I were talking about our exciting new framework
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.680]   laptop.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.200]   Yes.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.040]   But you're going to want a 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1X
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.280]   or whatever you're going to want.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.560]   Obviously.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.240]   This is the problem.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.760]   Obviously.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.240]   This is a terrible time of year for tech lovers.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.880]   It really is because we go broke.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.560]   We're like, you're fine.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.760]   Everything.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.280]   We just got an iPhone 13.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.480]   Now I got to get a Pixel 6.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.080]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.840]   What about the port, the Duo 2 from Microsoft?
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.960]   What about-- yeah, gosh.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.240]   All right, we'll change the subject.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.720]   Let's talk about the internet instead of hardware
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.080]   because, of course, this was Facebook's terrible no good,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.680]   very bad week in so many ways.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.180]   Oh.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.680]   Not great.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.180]   No.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.680]   Great.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.160]   Started last Sunday with a 60-minute interview.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.560]   The Facebook whistleblower finally came forward.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.200]   Her name is Frances Hagen.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.680]   She worked for a couple of years at Facebook.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.920]   What was her title?
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   She was working on--
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.200]   She's a data scientist.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.280]   She's a data scientist.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.440]   And I think she was working on election fraud.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.600]   She was on the information integrity team or something
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.440]   like that.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.560]   But-- and I don't think she went there
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.800]   to blow the whistle or anything.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.120]   I think she legitimately wanted to help Facebook do a better
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.000]   job.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   But when she saw what was going on,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.640]   she started amassing documents, documents
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.560]   from other departments, things she had access to,
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.960]   but wasn't working on, and released them eventually
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.040]   to the Wall Street Journal, which
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.880]   is spent two weeks doing its Facebook files bit by bit
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.280]   revealing things.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.960]   And I guess the top line was Instagram
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.080]   makes young women feel terrible.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.240]   Facebook knows about COVID-19 fraud,
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.360]   but can't do anything about it.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.000]   And in her division, Facebook, the day after the election,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.480]   stopped protecting people from misinformation, which possibly
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.600]   had something to do with the January 6th insurrection.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   So that was Sunday night.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.880]   The next day, Facebook, in completely coincidentally,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.720]   demonstrates to the worldwide desperately needs Facebook
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.760]   by going offline for five hours.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.480]   Some people might have had the opposite conclusion.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.040]   Oh, I don't really need that so much.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.600]   But Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp go down.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.400]   The world trembles 3 and 1/2 billion users go, what happened?
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.320]   It turns out that was an error by an engineer
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.560]   in one of their backbone facilities.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.400]   Facebook published a post, which I think is accurate.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.320]   You never know with Facebook.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.680]   It's not fully detailed, but it's the way they work.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.120]   They have a lot of network operation centers, all of which
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.480]   are interconnected via a backbone.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.080]   So you'll request an image from one,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.400]   and it can ask for it via its private backbone from the other.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.160]   Those backbones are commonly taken down and updated.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.480]   In this case, one was being taken down.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.040]   They ran a program that was supposed
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.840]   to test backbone capacity before they put it back up.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.480]   The program had a bug, and in the process,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.440]   they turned off all of the backbones, then all of the routers.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.120]   And then, and imagine this at Microsoft,
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.480]   they turned off all of the security stuff
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.080]   so they couldn't even get into the network centers
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   to fix the problem.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.920]   The card readers stopped working.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.840]   It's like dispatch, like special ops teams kind of like
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.920]   to the data centers from what I read to say,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.320]   like to get in and actually--
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   Wire cutters.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   Wire cutters.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   No, because I mean, at that point,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.880]   if you've broken everything to the point
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.760]   that you can't get inside the buildings, I mean--
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   Oof.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.680]   We've had internal stuff go down before,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.360]   where our internal share point or teams or email went down.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   And that sucks.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.200]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.360]   That's awful.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.760]   But I mean, when it's as bad as the building doors don't unlock,
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.400]   oh my god.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:11.960]   I can't imagine the amount of terror and just triage that had
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.920]   to go into place to, A, get things back online.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.400]   And then it takes hours once you do change the configuration
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.160]   thing for everything to repopulate through DNS.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.680]   And again, the BGP routes reset again,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.600]   as well as standing up stuff that got shut down that isn't
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.840]   used to being down.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.040]   I mean, and then I'm sure testing everything
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.280]   to make sure everything's working the right way.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.000]   I'm not a fan of Facebook, but I had nothing but empathy
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.120]   for the engineers that had to work on getting that back up
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.200]   because the pressure must have just been terrible,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.760]   because as you said, 3 and 1/2 billion people,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.760]   it's your internal system to be bad enough.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.280]   But then all of your external system,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.960]   all of your customers, nothing is happening.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.480]   You're hearing I'm sure nothing but phone calls from people
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.080]   screaming, when is this going to be done?
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.480]   There's a term we use in the industry called a hug ops,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.880]   kind of giving empathy for the people who have to build stuff
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.160]   back up again.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.560]   Is there an emoji for that?
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.000]   I want to hug ops emoji.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.520]   I like that.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.480]   There should be an emoji for that.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.960]   But I mean, like I said, I don't think Facebook is the greatest
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.480]   company, but I had nothing but empathy for that scenario
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.000]   because that's just nightmarish.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.160]   I can't even imagine.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.720]   It doesn't look like it was human error.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.160]   It looks like it was, as always, in these cases,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.520]   a cascade of unexpected consequences that brought everything
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:30.720]   down.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.640]   And by the way, Cloudflare, we had a great blog post
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.120]   trying to understand this before Facebook revealed
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.240]   what really happened, pointed out that this affects everybody
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.840]   because suddenly all these requests to Facebook
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.760]   are getting rejected.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.160]   And so people keep refreshing and they keep hitting refresh.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.040]   Which just makes it worse.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.600]   The whole internet gets suddenly sluggish.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.760]   We are so interdependent.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.560]   I have to admit--
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.400]   and this is just paranoid Leo.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.640]   I imagine Mark Zuckerberg and his mountain layer
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   saying, we'll show those people.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.960]   And pull the plug for one minute, making five hours.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.040]   But that didn't reflect well on Facebook.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.800]   I don't think they would have done that.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.440]   So the weird thing is it went back down
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.560]   for another two hours on Friday.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.880]   You would think that, oh, well, we got this all.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.400]   We're never going to let that happen again.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.600]   We tested everything, right?
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.240]   We checked it all out, right?
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.000]   You guys tested that, right?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Twice.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.200]   You checked it in one week, twice?
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.720]   Right.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.040]   I mean, I have to imagine that I don't know what happened
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.480]   with that one.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.240]   But I have to imagine when you're saying stuff back up
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.760]   and you're in such a hurry and you have so much pressure
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.080]   to get it back up, that if maybe something
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.520]   wasn't propagated the right way and something was misconfigured
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.720]   but it came back online, who knows?
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.680]   But at least that one, I think, it just seemed
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.720]   like it was normal outage.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   It wasn't like, OK, internally, everything is down
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.800]   and externally.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.640]   I mean, because to me, that's the nightmare scenario
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.440]   of everything being down everywhere.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.560]   It wasn't intentional, but it did underscore
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.160]   how important Facebook is to the world
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.200]   economy, especially in countries like Brazil,
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.560]   where everybody uses WhatsApp and not just
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.120]   for talking to each other, but for business.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.720]   So many, many mama pop businesses
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.920]   lost thousands of dollars due to the outage.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.080]   It really shows how interconnected
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:23.360]   and how important, how into the wiring Facebook is.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.480]   Which just to me means another reason
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.200]   we got to really scrutinize them.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.360]   Well, it seems like--
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.400]   Yeah, I was just saying that all the stuff
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.680]   that we've heard recently with Apple and antitrust as well,
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.840]   but Facebook has also been under scrutiny for that.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.200]   And I think it is a good example of the fact
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.360]   that there are so many services and so many things
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.800]   that depend so heavily on it.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.080]   I was thinking back to--
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.840]   I was on vacation in Mexico a few years ago.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.880]   And if you were in your room and you wanted
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.480]   to contact the front desk, they didn't have phones.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.000]   You WhatsApped the front desk for a big service.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.200]   You've kept stuff.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.000]   Yeah, that was just the way it was, right?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.200]   And it's like--
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.360]   It's so prevalent and so people are so dependent on it
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.480]   that you have that moment of being like, well,
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.800]   is this a monopoly?
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.200]   Is this something where they control so much of this?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.320]   But because it's so global, rather than being focused in the US,
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.640]   you don't see as much scrutiny on it,
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.200]   at least from the US government.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.560]   So--
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.960]   Yeah, no, you're exactly right.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.240]   I've even dealt with big brands in other countries
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.120]   where their customer service is almost exclusively
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.400]   through WhatsApp.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.920]   And it's just like that's just the way that you contact people.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.800]   So the whistleblower testified in front of the Senate,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.440]   the Commerce Committee, on Tuesday,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.480]   and basically said it's time for Facebook
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.680]   to declare moral bankruptcy, which I thought
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.480]   was an interesting concept.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.960]   We'd know about email bankruptcy,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.680]   where you just throw up your hands and say,
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.280]   I'm never going to get to your email.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.960]   I'm throwing them all out and starting over.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.120]   Her opinion was Facebook should say, yeah,
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.640]   we didn't mean to create this monster, but it's a mess,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.440]   and we don't know how to fix it.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.320]   Help us.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.320]   I'm not sure I agree.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.960]   And I'm very curious what you all think.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.800]   I'll start with you, Dan.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.760]   I don't know if I think Congress is the place to go for help.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.280]   Because I don't think that-- I mean, anybody who thinks
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.960]   Finsta is a Facebook service clearly
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.640]   should not be in a position to regulate Facebook.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.160]   That was, of course, some of your points.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.600]   It's hard to say, because the question is,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.880]   when you get to that size-- and Apple is also
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.880]   in a position that's dealing with this right now--
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.920]   there really aren't a lot of other things to turn to,
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.600]   besides government regulation.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.840]   I mean, the market is so self-sustaining at that point,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.120]   because it's so big, and it keeps getting bigger,
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.960]   that I think that it's really tough to be like,
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.400]   well, the competition will take them down.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.040]   I mean, how could you start a competition at this point
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.960]   to take on Facebook?
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.840]   No, could users--
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.680]   These are so large.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.480]   We've seen dump Facebook movements,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.800]   but they've not in any way--
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.320]   It doesn't catch on, right?
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.200]   I mean, I think that's the question,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.280]   is then I agree that the Congress is not always
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.440]   the most technologically savvy, but I think in terms
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.520]   of trying to figure out what are the tools we can deploy.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.120]   What else do they need?
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.480]   Yeah, they may be the only recourse at this point,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.240]   because I don't know--
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.480]   the problem-- it kind of goes even larger than this,
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.040]   in some ways, because as long as Facebook has that obligation
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.760]   to its shareholders to try and maximize value,
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.200]   they're going to try to make as much money as possible.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.600]   And sometimes that's going to mean cutting
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.760]   those moral corners.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.160]   And I don't think there's an incentive for them not
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.720]   to do that despite what Zuckerberg says.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.040]   Christina, very famously in '98, the Department of Justice
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.240]   sued Microsoft.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   Yep.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.520]   And while it went on for a decade,
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.640]   and eventually there was a consent decree,
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.760]   I think it's safe to say that that was successful in the sense
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.400]   that it got Microsoft to kind of sit back a little bit,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.480]   not be so aggressive in the market, not pursue its monopoly.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.920]   One of the things Microsoft does is kind of a Facebook's
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   taking a page from that playbook is if there's
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.160]   a competitor, invite them in, find out how they work,
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.040]   then either buy them or steal their technology
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.480]   and duplicate it.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.400]   Microsoft used to do that, and golf and devour.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.000]   But they stopped--
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.160]   In place, it's to extinguish.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.480]   Yes, that's the word, that's the phrase.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.840]   But I think it's fair to say that that DOJ investigation
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.880]   succeeded in stopping.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.320]   And here's the interesting point.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.600]   It forced Microsoft to reassess, do the right thing, pivot,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.800]   and actually become a stronger company under Satya
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.440]   Nadella with web services.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.080]   Yeah, I mean, I think that's a good point.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.440]   I think the interesting thing there,
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.640]   I mean, obviously there were different scenarios.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.400]   I think that-- I've talked to people who--
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.800]   I mean, obviously, it was decades before I
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.920]   worked at the company, right?
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.600]   And so I don't know what's happening there.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   And I should say, you don't speak for the company
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.040]   in any respect.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.600]   No, I don't speak for the company in any respect.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.640]   But this was decades before I worked there.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:57.120]   But the circumstances with that, I think people
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.360]   that I've talked to who either were there then
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.720]   and some of them are still Microsoft, some of them aren't.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.040]   What they've said is that it did maybe
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.240]   change the nature and how things were focused on the company.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.440]   And the culture, yeah.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.640]   But it took a long time.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.000]   There was a dark period after that investigation,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.080]   where the company did suffer for a long time.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.400]   So I think you can look on the net of it
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.440]   that even though the DOJ investigation
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.120]   was ultimately unsuccessful, like they--
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.160]   Microsoft won an appeal.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.120]   They weren't broken up.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.160]   There were some consent things and some changes
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.080]   that were made, but ultimately the government didn't win.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.800]   There were still, by going through that process,
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.440]   I think it's impossible to say that there
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.080]   wasn't substantive impact on the company.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.960]   What was interesting is that although that--
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.080]   I think you could look at it and say,
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.160]   we'll see this had a good impact.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.000]   It also did during that period of time,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.040]   if you look at when the appeals and all those things were
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.680]   happening, was the exact same time
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.280]   that Google and Facebook were really starting to--
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:56.760]   That's right.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.600]   --open rise.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.920]   You can make the case that if Microsoft haven't been slapped
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.120]   down, Google and Facebook might not exist.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.600]   Right.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.880]   And so I'm not opposed to government intervention,
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.120]   and I'm not opposed to there being regulations.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.080]   I think that that's important.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.720]   I'm with you.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.480]   I'm a little bit leery sometimes, I think,
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.200]   on just deferring to them because I
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   don't think they understand the technology well enough.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.240]   And I do feel like sometimes some of these things that
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.040]   are interconnected to the point--
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.960]   I mean, this is actually I think something
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.760]   that some of these companies, Facebook in particular,
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.480]   have learned from the Microsoft lawsuit stuff--
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.040]   is that the way that they built their services together,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.560]   it would be very difficult to break them apart
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.040]   in a traditional way.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.680]   So I'm in favor of more oversight and regulation
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.440]   if it's on the right way, but I'm also
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.080]   kind of leery about what impact it can actually have.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.600]   I mean, if your goal is really just to slow down the business
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.280]   and make them have to reassess, then say that.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.720]   But if you're saying that your goal
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.960]   is to actually make some sort of substantive change
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.680]   on a policy level, I guess I'm a little bit more cynical
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.960]   and skeptical that that's actually
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.920]   going to be achieved through the legislation.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.720]   What do you think, Daniel?
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.480]   Can we learn anything from what the DOJ did with Microsoft?
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.840]   Does that any template for what could happen with Facebook?
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.800]   Would it work?
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.760]   This is a very, obviously as you all pointed out,
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.280]   complicated problem.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.120]   One that we've predicted and seen even
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.040]   in dystopian movies like Blade Runner and RoboCop,
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.920]   where we always see the Runaway Corporation that
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.080]   becomes so vital and crucial to the infrastructure and systems
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.000]   that it's almost impossible to displace it
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.400]   without taking down the entire system.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.840]   And that's where these services are headed.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.600]   I'm not sure we're there right now.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.200]   Facebook went down and as you pointed out,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.840]   there were some ramifications from it,
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.240]   but it's not like we headed towards nuclear war.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.520]   It was just very inconvenient.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.000]   As far as you know, Daniel.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.840]   As far as you know.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.160]   As far as we know, right.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.200]   But you're also right where traditionally,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.600]   government intervention would be the solution here,
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.920]   but as demonstrated this week,
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.440]   the government is quite at this point,
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.480]   incapable of understanding the technology.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.240]   And it's easy to make fun of them for that.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.600]   However, if you don't do this stuff full time,
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.840]   it is very difficult to understand all those details.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.880]   I'm not really sure where we go from here.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.160]   I'm actually pretty down on this stuff
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.040]   because I don't see any obvious solutions to fixing this.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.480]   Dan pointed out correctly that there's no incentive here.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.440]   Capitalism is an amoral system.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.040]   So I always kind of chuckle when people will say,
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.840]   these companies are doing the wrong thing.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.680]   It's like there is no wrong or right.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.480]   The only wrong or right is internally
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.960]   is do they make money for their shareholders.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   That's literally all that matters.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.520]   So it's a little weird to give moral lessons to Facebook
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.920]   who clearly don't care.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.360]   And it's not in their charter to care.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.680]   - Well, but in this respect,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.400]   we are maybe making them care
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.440]   because it could impact their business, right?
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.480]   So there is a little bit of a stick
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.280]   that government and the Department of Justice
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.240]   can wield saying, well, we can hurt you financially.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.760]   And so if you're thinking long-term financial success,
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.560]   you might say, you know,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.080]   maybe we should be a little bit better at what we do.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.160]   - It's just historically where we come down
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.760]   to like fines for government from the government.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.600]   - Yeah, those don't.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.160]   - These companies make so much money now.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.000]   - Yeah, does it matter?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.840]   - They just paid off.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   - Yeah, look at the EU fines.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   - Yeah, that was a good one.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.680]   - That would be my question.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.520]   - That would be my question.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.360]   - That would be my question.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.560]   - Can they financially hurt them?
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.680]   Is that possible?
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.240]   - Like how big of a fine do you have to leverage
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.920]   to get to a point where it is a major disruption?
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.960]   I mean, there was the whole thing about when the, you know,
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.680]   when Facebook went down for five hours
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.840]   and Mark Zuckerberg lost $7 billion.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.160]   That was like, boo-hoo, he's got 120 billion.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160]   - Now you'll get it back.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.360]   Effect he probably has already.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.200]   - He'll take it back.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.000]   - Yeah, so can you hurt them?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.160]   I don't know if you can.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.000]   - Mark Zuckerberg's response to the testimony
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.040]   was very typical Facebook,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.080]   which is a lot of hand-waving misdirection.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.220]   And ultimately Facebook says, yeah,
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.080]   regulate the internet.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.640]   Get rid of that section 230.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.160]   We don't like that,
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.600]   which had nothing to do with this at all.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.960]   He writes on Facebook, which I would,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.320]   as you can see, I'm not logged in
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.760]   because I don't have a Facebook account,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.560]   but I can kind of read what he's,
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.520]   you want to see more of Mark Zuckerberg buying a Facebook?
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.000]   No, no, thank you.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.600]   No, he wrote, "Many of the claims don't make sense."
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.120]   Now Mark is a smart guy.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.760]   Went to Harvard, maybe he didn't graduate.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.080]   Okay, but he went to Harvard.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.280]   He's a smart guy.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.360]   If we wanted to ignore research, he says,
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.600]   why would we create an industry-leading research program
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.400]   to understand these important issues in the first place?
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.120]   Well, maybe you created it
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.680]   and then didn't like the answer.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.400]   I ever think of that.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.840]   - Let me answer your question with a question.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.280]   - If we didn't care about fighting harmful content,
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.120]   why would we employ so many more people dedicated to this
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.720]   than any other company in our space?
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.560]   Why?
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.700]   I ask you.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.360]   (laughs)
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.980]   If we wanted to hide our results,
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.180]   why would we have established an industry-leading standard?
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.980]   This I questioned for transparency
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.740]   and reporting on what we're doing.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.580]   What we know is Facebook is actively defeating the attempts
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.100]   from outside investigators like at NYU
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.720]   from seeing this material.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.780]   They didn't want to release this material to the public.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.140]   They were forced to buy this whistleblower
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.580]   and even then only released a little bit
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.180]   of the research, not all of it.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.100]   Yeah, that's the question, Mark.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.140]   If you didn't care about understanding these issues,
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.380]   why would you create an industry-leading research group
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.900]   and then bury the results?
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.700]   If you, and this is what I think Facebook ought to do.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.900]   Now, I don't know if you can make them do this,
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.780]   maybe shame them into doing this.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.940]   They need to not only release the results of their research,
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.540]   but they have to open themselves to outside researchers
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.740]   and then we all need to hear the results.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.940]   And then we as a society can decide.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.860]   If it does, in fact, turn out, Facebook kind of says,
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.460]   "Well, in 12 out of 13 points,
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.380]   "young women feel better on Instagram."
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.660]   It's just that one 13th.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.820]   And by the way, Francis Huggins said,
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.420]   "Do not buy this 'cause only 10% of people
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.980]   "who smoke die of cancer, it's still a problem."
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.300]   Okay?
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.020]   Facebook is really acting like big tobacco here.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.980]   I don't think you can shame them.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.420]   I mean, that's the other thing.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   I'm not sure there's any way to shame them.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.860]   If they, again, Daniel reiterated,
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.500]   like, if it doesn't make money,
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.980]   that's the only thing that actually makes
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.820]   a difference to them.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.460]   So I think they have shown they have no shame
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.740]   and that is not a good way to leverage them.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.780]   - I also think that they've convinced themselves
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.900]   that they are acting morally and ethically
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.060]   in the right way and that they have good intentions.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.180]   I don't have as many friends who work at Facebook
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.780]   anymore as I used to, but I've known many people
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.820]   who use work there.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.660]   - Good people. - Yes.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.500]   - Yeah, very good people.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.340]   That's the thing. - Yes.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.380]   - I mean, especially 2016, and that was when
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.820]   the public shift really started to happen.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.860]   It was around 2016 and around a lot of the misinformation
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.420]   stuff when the stuff about Cambridge Analytica came out,
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.300]   Myanmar, the election integrity stuff.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.900]   And internally, a lot of the people that I knew
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.860]   who worked there had a really hard time
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.340]   with the public perception changing
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.700]   because many of them, and they're very moral people,
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.180]   they're very upstanding people who were like,
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.900]   "No, but we're trying to do good things.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.460]   We have good intentions."
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.020]   And they had a really hard time with, I think,
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.820]   dealing with the disconnect between the public perception
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.980]   or the growing public perception
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.260]   and what their internal view of themselves were.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.940]   And so even now, I still feel like most people
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.380]   who work there, especially the executives,
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.580]   A, I don't think they can be shamed,
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.140]   but B, I think that they've convinced themselves
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.100]   that, "No, we're doing the right things
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.500]   and the way that we're going about these things
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.980]   is for the good of everyone."
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.380]   Yes, of course, it makes us money,
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.780]   but we're on the straight and narrow.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.820]   So trying to convince them,
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.580]   if genocide hasn't been enough to convince them,
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.140]   say, "Hey, maybe we need to take a serious look
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.700]   at how our platform's being used.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.580]   I'm not sure if the health of teenage girls
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.300]   is going to move the needle."
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.140]   - I think that's a really good point
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.020]   with the institutions in terms of institutional memory
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.700]   and how things operate.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.140]   We have to think of even some of the worst
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.020]   dictatorships in the world.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.380]   They didn't think they were doing evil.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.820]   Like, you have to understand that.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.460]   Like those people doing those things,
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.300]   thought they were doing the right thing.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.740]   So shaming people at Facebook is really not going to change
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.580]   anything because they do, they have to believe
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.220]   that what they are doing is the right thing
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.060]   and the appropriate thing.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.780]   I think the most that's going to come out of this
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.740]   will probably see like government commercials
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.300]   and ads talking about your kids
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   and don't want them on Facebook for too long.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.380]   I think it's going to be like the anti-smoking campaign.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.420]   And I don't think it's, until the system gets fundamentally
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.260]   changed and turning governance of how corporations are run,
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.700]   I don't think any of this is actually going to affect Facebook
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.540]   in the long term.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.620]   We haven't seen it in their stocks.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.620]   We haven't seen it in the user base.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.380]   They're kind of impervious and most governments
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.860]   are too shy to actually do anything.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.180]   And the most worrisome thing I saw in that 60 minutes interview
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:35.420]   was about how the best moderation happens in the United States,
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.340]   but the rest of the world, especially in emerging and developing
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.180]   in countries, they can't.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.580]   And they don't have like almost any moderation.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.420]   Yeah, it's absolutely just horrendous
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.540]   that something gets posted there.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.700]   And it's just like, that's the world we're building.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.300]   And that's very, very frightening.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.380]   - Yep, if they're going to lose out anywhere,
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.460]   I think there's a very long-term thing where their user base
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.380]   tends to be older on average, I think.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.460]   And that's part of the reason they acquired things
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.740]   like Instagram and WhatsApp, right?
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.380]   To expand beyond just the core Facebook
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.620]   because we've seen most kids today, teens, et cetera,
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.940]   they're not spending time on Facebook.
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.060]   They spend time on TikTok or something more like that, right?
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.260]   So their user base will age out eventually,
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.420]   but they're also so huge at this point
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.900]   that they're going to just keep going for a really long time,
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.420]   regardless of whether or not
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.500]   that's where the place where people are going or not.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.820]   'Cause it takes a long time to run out
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.500]   of the billions of dollars they have.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.540]   - The other thing I would add, and I'm sincere when I say this,
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.380]   while I acknowledge the issues, is that it isn't,
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.500]   I don't think it's fair to blame technology, big tech,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.740]   social media for our own flaws.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.020]   And this doesn't come out of Facebook.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.580]   Facebook is a mirror of the world.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.300]   It may be as an amplifier, I think you make a case
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.900]   that it amplifies, but really the problem,
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.660]   the polarization, the issues with climate denial,
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.260]   all of the problems we have in this world,
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.740]   are created by people, not by big tech.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.140]   - I think that's true, but I think that the important
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.300]   distinction here, and this is what I think,
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.580]   Francis Hogan was kind of talking about,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   and what's important is that when they change their algorithms
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.620]   to juice things for engagement and for a reaction,
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.100]   and when they determine what content they're going to show you
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.820]   and what content they're going to amplify,
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.060]   and it all sort of, when they got rid of the reverse,
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.220]   kind of timeline, and they started to show things
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.860]   algorithmically, and when they make the decisions
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.820]   about what types of content they're going to bubble up
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.620]   and show, and what they're going to really try to get people
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.060]   to engage the most with, because they know
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.580]   they'll spend more time on the site,
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.700]   then I do think it changes things a little bit,
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.900]   and in your right, these are human problems,
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.860]   but we haven't had this situation before,
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.620]   and that's why there aren't direct parallels
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.580]   that we can make with things that have happened in the past.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.780]   Obviously, mass media has existed,
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.660]   for at this point, hundreds of years.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.780]   - And people, by the way, said the same thing,
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.460]   and I remember it very well about TV.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.700]   I mean, this, TV's destroying our youth.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.020]   - Right, but the difference is,
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.300]   we haven't had to this point,
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.500]   you haven't had TV where there has been
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.620]   algorithmically determined,
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.220]   and it's changing the online TV now,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.540]   but where the content that you see has been chosen
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.300]   based on what will keep you watching,
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.980]   and what will make you engage the most,
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.020]   and when psychologically they know
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.940]   that the things that make you angry
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.180]   are things that will, or polarize you,
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.220]   are things that will keep you engaged the longest.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.980]   That, I think, is the difference.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.620]   You've had people who would program content
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.580]   and would put, you know, that's the whole story
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.540]   of talk radio and get people to have a reaction,
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.380]   but when the content that you do, absolutely.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.420]   - But when the content that you do,
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.460]   as soon as they discovered that,
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.940]   talk radio turned into a cesspool.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.020]   - 100%, and that went along with,
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.500]   in the government deregulation in terms of ownership
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.540]   of airwaves and loosening restrictions,
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.900]   in terms of what sort of content could be on the radio
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.580]   and whatnot.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.140]   So that went a lot into it,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.820]   but I think that the interesting thing is,
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.100]   if this were all organically being displayed to people,
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.780]   I would have an easier time with that argument
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.700]   that this is just a human problem,
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.340]   but it's not organically decided.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.860]   It's algorithmically determined in a way
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.060]   for people to be the most incensed and engaged
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.140]   and spend the most amount of time on site.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.420]   - This is doing what Daniel was saying.
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.820]   This is optimizing the profit.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.260]   In fact, that's what Francis Hagen said.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.740]   They prefer profit over people.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.580]   - Exactly.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.420]   - And that's what algorithms do,
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.900]   unless you tune the algorithm to do something else,
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.740]   but why would you?
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.660]   You're a business.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.780]   We're gonna tune the algorithm to increase engagement
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.820]   to make more money, period.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.540]   And you see what happens on YouTube?
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.020]   You see what happens on Facebook.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:40.860]   - Yes.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.700]   - It radicalizes people.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.460]   So I agree with you.
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.140]   - It's a dangerous system for setting up.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.540]   Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have,
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.300]   you can't have unlimited growth for companies,
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.100]   even though that's what the stock market wants
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.420]   and believes in.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.940]   And then even to begin into regulation,
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.780]   it's like, what do you regulate good behavior?
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.860]   Who determines that?
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.860]   How do you enforce that kind of thing?
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.940]   Who determines what good is?
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.380]   But the systems are built, you know, you're right.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.540]   They are mirrors of our own actions,
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.340]   but those algorithms do happen to, you know,
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.180]   the human brain is--
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.020]   - They're fun house mirrors, aren't they?
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.860]   - They applaud.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.300]   - They just, they take us and they distort the worst of us.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.180]   And with that result, I wanna actually talk about algorithms
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.540]   because there is, there's an example of algorithms
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.860]   that nobody's paying any attention to.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.780]   There could be worse, actually worse.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.340]   We got a great, I wanna take a break right now
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.460]   'cause we're half an hour in.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.500]   I wanna introduce, again, a fabulous panel,
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.940]   Daniel Rabino for Windows Central.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.740]   Yes, we'll get to Windows 11.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.500]   That's why Daniel's here.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.500]   Dan Morin on the Mac side from sixcolors.com.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.580]   Yes, we'll talk about the iPhone 13.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.940]   That's why Dan's here.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.780]   And of course, Christina Warren,
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.060]   Senior Cloud Advocate for Microsoft.
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.820]   Yes, we will talk about Animal Crossing and Sneakers.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.580]   That's why Christina is here.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.420]   - That's why I'm here.
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.860]   (laughs)
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.860]   A really great panel.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.940]   I showed it, they brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.100]   You know, there are all sorts of challenges
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.260]   to being a small business.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.500]   I have become intimately acquainted with all of them.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.540]   One of them is, where's the Stamps?
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.140]   Where's the Stamps?
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.260]   We got a mail a package.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.820]   How are we gonna do that?
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.420]   Stamps.com solved that for us more than a decade ago.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.820]   And I don't know if you have a small business.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.980]   I don't know why you would do anything else.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.340]   Look, I love the post office
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.100]   but the last thing I wanna do is go down.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.300]   We used to send people down
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.540]   to the post office to wait in line.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.940]   That is just expensive and senseless.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.820]   When you can do everything you wanna do at the post office
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.900]   from your computer, your printer,
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.020]   you don't need a postage meter,
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.700]   you just need Stamps.com.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.740]   You'll even save money.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.820]   You'll send packages and letters for less
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:45.820]   with discounted rates.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.300]   And by the way, this is really good news.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.380]   It's not just the US Postal Service.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.540]   Now Stamps.com does UPS as well.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.220]   So since 1998, Stamps.com has been an indispensable tool
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.300]   for more than a million businesses.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.660]   They bring the services of the US Postal Service
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.780]   and now UPS right to you and your computer.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.100]   If you are an Etsy seller in Amazon or eBay seller,
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.900]   if you send out brochures or bills, anything you do,
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.060]   Stamps.com can make it easier.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.340]   If it fills in the address from your software automatically,
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.220]   it fills in the return address from your address book.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.020]   It even prints your company logo.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.580]   It'll even do it right on the envelope.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.580]   You don't need Stamps at all.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.020]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.820]   You can mail any letter, any package,
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.820]   anywhere you wanna send in.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.300]   And man, the discounts, I gotta tell you.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.220]   You save money on postage from the US Postal Service.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.460]   Stamps.com has been a partner of Twit for 10 years now.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.700]   If you haven't tried him yet,
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.940]   I don't know what you're waiting for.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.260]   I've been telling you about this for a decade.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.340]   Cut the confusion out of shipping.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.820]   Stamps.com has a new rate advisor tool,
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.820]   which is great 'cause you can use it with both UPS and USPS
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.860]   to figure out what's the best way to ship,
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.940]   what the timelines are.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.460]   And I just love it.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.300]   You'll save time.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.740]   You'll save money with Stamps.com.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.580]   And you know what?
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.860]   We've got a deal for you that is completely risk free.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.660]   If you go to Stamps.com,
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.340]   there's a microphone at the top of the page.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.300]   Click that, type in Twit.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.460]   You'll get a special offer.
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.500]   It includes a four week trial.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.660]   You get free postage.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.540]   You get a USB scale, which is real.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.380]   Oh, it's nice.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.220]   You don't have to click a page.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.180]   You just type in Twit right next to the microphone now.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.020]   That's great.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.180]   You'll get that USB scale, which makes it so that's always,
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.820]   you always know how much.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.540]   Just go to Stamps.com.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.740]   Type in Twit at the top of the homepage and try our offer.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:37.740]   It is a great deal, including $55 in postage coupons
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.380]   that you can use over the next few months,
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.260]   saving you even more.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.260]   I just think it's a fantastic deal.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.380]   Snow long-term commitments, no contracts.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.620]   Stamps.com.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.060]   Use the promo code TWIT, T-W-I-T.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.580]   Never go to the post office again,
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.420]   unless you want to say hi, 'cause you know what?
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.540]   I love our postal carrier.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.100]   I like got stopping and saying hi,
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.620]   but after we landing, we're gonna do that.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.020]   I just say hi and open my posted box and go home.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.900]   Stamps.com.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.060]   You're gonna love it.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:09.540]   We thank Stamps.com for a long time supporting Twit.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.500]   I've mixed feelings about this because as it turns out,
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.700]   I know a good many people who are doing very well
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.300]   on TikTok, including my son Hank,
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   who's about ready to get to a million subscribers.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.740]   He's doing, yeah.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.580]   Oh my God.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.420]   I know.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.820]   Oh my God, I'm teasing.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.660]   I can't knock it.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.980]   He's also really big on Instagram, so I shouldn't knock either.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.580]   But when you talk about algorithmic,
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:35.140]   and I know this from talking to my son,
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.380]   nobody does it better than TikTok, right?
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.660]   No, they're the best.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.780]   They're the best.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.860]   That's the value.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.100]   And he spends a lot of energy looking
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.980]   and analyzing, okay, it was too long.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.660]   It didn't get to this fast enough.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.780]   I need more juicy hamburgers.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.340]   I mean, he knows it.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.220]   He's become a master of the algorithm.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:59.020]   I tell him, careful because if you're making your living
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.900]   on TikTok, they could pull the plug at any time.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.860]   There's a great article on The Atlantic this week
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.820]   by Evelyn Doolick.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.740]   One billion TikTok users understand what Congress doesn't.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.740]   The video sharing app avoids scrutiny because
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.220]   politicians don't take it seriously.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:20.340]   And yet, talk about algorithm.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.580]   It's benign at this point, but at any point, TikTok could,
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.100]   I don't know what, I mean,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.820]   is it everything we just said about Facebook and YouTube
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.520]   double for TikTok?
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.620]   Christina, do you use--
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.940]   - And the problem is, quick, more personal.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.780]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.260]   I mean, I'm not on TikTok, but I use it all the time, absolutely.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.140]   - Actually, that's one benefit you do not have,
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.420]   unlike what you just saw with Facebook,
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.540]   I can go look at my son's site without joining me.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.660]   - I mean, I have an account, but I don't post content.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:56.500]   I'm thinking about it, but I haven't jumped into that realm.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.860]   But which actually I think is what's interesting
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.300]   about TikTok versus the other social networks,
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.620]   is that it's one of the few.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.860]   Obviously, there are some people who have personalities
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.140]   and who people can follow the multiple places,
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.700]   but it's fundamentally not connected
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.940]   to who you know in real life.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.300]   Your social graph is about interest, right?
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.860]   - And that's another thing I've noticed.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.780]   I follow, obviously, a follow my son in TikTok.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.100]   So TikTok, you have two tabs, the 4U page,
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.660]   which is their pure algorithmic.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:29.020]   And then I thought following, which would be non-algorithmic,
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.700]   I have yet to see Henry's videos
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.500]   and following, even though I'm following him.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.740]   And I think it's just as algorithmic as a 4U page.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.380]   They still show you what they think
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.420]   you're gonna wanna see.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.540]   And for some reason, they think I wanna see
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.020]   a lot of bikini-clad young women.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.500]   I don't know why that is.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.460]   - Yes.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.140]   - It's certainly the thing I did.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.020]   But he does food videos, and I bet you,
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.980]   if you were interested in a lot of food stuff,
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.580]   you'd see, I mean, it must be,
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:58.140]   because he's got, this video has 41 million views, right?
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.260]   - You can get really kind of like,
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.660]   my girlfriend uses it religiously,
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.060]   but then she'll start going down
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.900]   that rabbit hole like cancer information.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.140]   Not that she has cancer, but she's just curious.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.060]   The next thing you know,
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.260]   all cancer all the time. - All cancer, all the time.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.100]   - Yeah.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.100]   - And she's like, I needed to stop.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.820]   She's like, I don't wanna, it's depressing.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.900]   I don't wanna know all of this.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.100]   And so that is the problem, the algorithm,
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.060]   in the sense of what you're looking for.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.660]   And it does become sort of your online personality,
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.380]   but then you can just delete the account and start over.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.900]   - Well, the only thing TikTok is optimizing for at this point,
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.020]   it seems to be his entertainment.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.580]   They just, they have the perfect feedback loop.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.460]   They know exactly how long it took
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.260]   before you swiped up to the next video.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.100]   Exactly.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.020]   And they just go, oh, you spent 23 seconds.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.260]   There we'll give you more like that.
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.780]   Four seconds there, less like that.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.580]   And it completely could be automatic.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.000]   I doubt there's human intervention, although they get,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.900]   they occasionally get hit, they, apparently if you are fat,
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.820]   they weren't showing your videos for a while.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.180]   I think there's human intervention
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.900]   because Henry just started taking a sponsor for the first time.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.500]   And I notice anywhere where he shows a product placement,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.580]   it's a spice and he shows it briefly.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.740]   Like a second, the one-tenth number of views.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.780]   So I think that they are somehow algorithmically saying,
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.820]   no, no, no, we don't, we want to make our money,
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.820]   not his money.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.380]   And so they don't promote that as much.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:20.140]   But you can see immediately the effect of the algorithm
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.940]   very directly.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.540]   They're doing it, but not only though,
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.220]   like nobody's complaining.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.860]   I'm not seeing, I imagine, I guess if you followed Donald Trump,
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.580]   you'd see a lot of Trump videos, I don't know.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.340]   - Is there an argument that it's just like,
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.700]   I just wondered if it was by,
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.140]   I mean, how much of this is by chance?
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.580]   I mean, I don't think entirely obviously,
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.020]   but there does seem to be almost a more of a virtuous cycle there
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.500]   in terms of like, if positive content is the stuff
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.380]   that bubbles to the top and far a TikTok goes,
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.420]   then maybe that helps reinforce that
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.980]   as opposed to something like Facebook,
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   which seems to thrive on the negative content.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.220]   And it could have just as easily gone the other way,
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.060]   but for some reason, it did.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.980]   - Oh, that's a good point.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.940]   They could be doing outrage.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.540]   They're not optimizing for outrage,
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.700]   you're optimizing for fun.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.500]   - Engagement, which is like the flip side.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.340]   - Not yet.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.380]   - I'm not saying that couldn't change.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.860]   And then again, I'm not sure how much of that is just by chance
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.980]   as opposed to something that they like hit upon, but yeah.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.220]   - It's really interesting.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.260]   I just, I mean, it's funny,
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.420]   'cause I shouldn't say they've not been scrutinized.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.500]   Last year under President Trump,
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.700]   he wanted to force him to sell.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.420]   In fact, there's such an Adele talking
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.180]   at the Code Conference with Cara Swisher,
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.100]   said that was an interesting thing.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.460]   (both laughing)
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.340]   What did your boss say, Christina?
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.660]   - Yeah, it was like, it was an odd autumn.
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.300]   And he said, we didn't go to them.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.340]   They came to us, which I thought was it.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.860]   We never knew the details of this,
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.220]   but we knew that Microsoft was in the running to buy TikTok.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.420]   They came to us. - Right.
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.940]   - We thought it was weird, but then we thought,
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.660]   well, you know, social graph billions of users.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.980]   In fact, TikTok this past week beat YouTube
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.860]   in the amount of time people spend watching videos on TikTok.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.220]   So really good. - The fastest
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.940]   to one billion users too, right?
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.420]   - Really good engagement.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.420]   So I understand such has said, well, I guess, maybe,
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.660]   but then all of a sudden, no, no,
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.220]   it's gonna be Oracle and Walmart.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.540]   - Right.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.860]   - And such has said, they just ghosted us.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.020]   He said, that was it.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.620]   We didn't hear from him again.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.140]   And then of course, the president ghosted that
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.620]   and nothing happened and it's over.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.260]   And I guess President Biden has said,
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.300]   well, we're gonna look into it, but nothing's come of it.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.140]   - Right, right.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.300]   I mean, the whole way that happened was just so bizarre.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.500]   Obviously, like I've learned the same way.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.260]   Everybody else learned whatever details
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.340]   that happened on the Microsoft side from that code
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.580]   in our view, but the whole thing always seems sketch.
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.940]   And then it was like, as soon as, you know,
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.260]   they made like the Oracle Walmart thing,
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.380]   but then nothing happened, then, you know,
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.820]   Trump lost the election and there's like,
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.620]   oh, well, guess that's not happening.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.580]   - It's over. - And it's over.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.380]   You know, the executives, like, guy had left Disney
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.180]   to go to TikTok, then he had to leave
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.900]   because he was like, hey, I wasn't even part
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.380]   of these conversations.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.060]   You know, he was like, I don't even know what's going on.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.540]   I'm supposed to be the CEO of the US version of the company.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.740]   No one tells me anything.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:20.820]   So I have to quit, you know, like,
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.140]   the whole thing was just bizarre.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.100]   It was like, okay, well, we're gonna like come up
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.860]   with this weird and even like the Oracle Walmart thing
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.260]   was like, well, we might have data sovereignty,
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.340]   but we might not.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.340]   The algorithm and those things might still be owned by,
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.180]   the whole thing was just so insane.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.620]   Like to think about that, that was a year ago
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.780]   and that that was like an actual reality thing.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.620]   The thing that actually happened was that a government
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:48.100]   tried to force, you know, private businesses to buy.
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.020]   - I should point out, oh, and yeah,
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.380]   and let's not forget that Trump wanted a key fee.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.460]   He said, and you're gonna give me some of that motherfucker.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.060]   - Yes, oh, and I'm gonna get a,
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.100]   a big on this, thank you.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:01.940]   - You know, it's a little big.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.060]   They call it in real estate, New York real estate,
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.340]   they call it a key fee.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.700]   You get a little something for introducing somebody
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.660]   to a realtor to the buyer, you get a little key fee.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.340]   Actually, in the intro--
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.060]   - I just flew me right at Republicans.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:15.900]   - Pardon me?
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:16.900]   - I was gonna say, I just thought it was weird
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.460]   that Republicans were like, yeah,
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.100]   the government should step in forced to sail
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.500]   of a company to American companies.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.340]   - That's who we've always been.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.820]   - By the way, families have the best system in the world.
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.140]   - Right.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.940]   - But it's just so bizarre. - I'm gonna point out.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.780]   - What the hell is not here?
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.820]   - In their defense, they might've been right
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.860]   because in the time since, just last month,
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:41.020]   Beijing took a big forced, a big investment in Tencent,
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:44.380]   their parent company, I'm sorry, ByteDance,
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.780]   and they got a board seat on ByteDance.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.780]   So all of a sudden, the Chinese Communist Party
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.220]   is kinda in the front door of TikTok.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.220]   - Well, yeah, but we've known that.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.060]   - Yeah, they know the state counts.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.100]   - If you're a major company in China,
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.300]   China is involved.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.900]   Like that's how that works.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.340]   Like, I don't think that's controversial to say
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.700]   that if you were a Chinese-based company
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.820]   and you make lots of money,
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.220]   the Chinese Communist Party is deeply involved
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.060]   in your business.
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.300]   - Yeah, the information reported that China
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.940]   had quietly taken an equity stake in ByteDance.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.740]   They didn't say they bought an equity stake.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.700]   - No, they took it.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.700]   - They took an equity stake.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.140]   - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.540]   - We'll take 30%.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.380]   That's all.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.220]   That's good enough for Apple.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.940]   - Have you seen the Chinese Communist Party's
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.660]   TikToks 'cause they're really, you know, I know.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.300]   - I was gonna say they're really good at TikToks.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.300]   - They're really good at TikToks.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.140]   - They're really good at TikToks.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.060]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:33.900]   - Actually, the only thing-
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.740]   - Probably.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.300]   - I think the Chinese government should be censoring TikTok
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.340]   'cause the only Chinese TikToks I see
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:46.460]   are of horrific manufacturing facilities in China.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.060]   The one I most recently saw is a SOC factory
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.420]   where all the people on the assembly line
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.900]   are their hands resting on their hands,
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.940]   face-wrestling their hands.
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.340]   Well, they put socks on sock molds.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.940]   It looks horrible.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.820]   That's what they should be censoring.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.660]   They're not a fair enough.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.860]   - Oh, I'm sure they do in China.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.700]   I'm sure China-
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.540]   - Oh, in China, they do.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.140]   Yeah, we know they censor Hong Kong content.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.180]   - It's not the worst thing happening in China,
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.020]   but I need to change that.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.020]   - All right.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:12.980]   Yeah, this is the quote,
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.580]   Sachin Adele told Cara Swisher,
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.700]   "The failed TikTok talks," which is hard to say,
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.780]   "The TikTok talks were the strangest thing
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.460]   I ever worked on," which is probably saying a lot.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.620]   I imagine Mr. N. Tell us worked on some other strange things.
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:33.660]   He says, "I was intrigued.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.700]   It's a great property.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.620]   Everybody's seen the growth and what have you.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.940]   The rest is history."
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:41.740]   There was a period of time
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:42.860]   when I felt the US government had
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.380]   some particular set of requirements
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.500]   and then they just disappeared.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.680]   Boom, it's over.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.900]   Bye-bye.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.940]   Anyway, I don't want to knock TikTok
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.420]   because like I said, my son probably
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:56.300]   is going to make his living as a TikTok.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.540]   So I shouldn't knock it.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.500]   But, and to be honest,
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.780]   there's an example of algorithm, I guess, done right, right?
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.460]   I mean, TikTok is so engaging,
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.180]   if you watch it for more than a few,
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.660]   okay, admit it, Kristina, you've seen this video.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.820]   If you watch it for too long,
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.060]   a guy comes on and says, "Stop."
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.060]   - Yeah.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.220]   - You've seen it, right?
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:19.300]   So have a drink.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.580]   Go get something to eat, stop.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.140]   You've been way too long on TikTok,
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.700]   which I think is hysterical.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.540]   I see that every night.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.420]   - Yeah, it's very funny.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.540]   Yeah, no, I mean, it's a very engaging platform.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:35.540]   They've completely perfected what started,
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.300]   you know, with earlier social networks.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.820]   - Musically, were you on Musically?
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.460]   Did you use Musically at first?
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.740]   - I mean, I was aware of it.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.580]   I didn't use it.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.420]   - It was lip syncing.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.260]   - I was a 13-year-old.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.380]   It was small children lip syncing.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.380]   It was really problematic a lot of ways.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.020]   - It was actually really problematic in a lot of ways.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:54.780]   And it attracted an improper element.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.100]   - I didn't think of that.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.940]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.020]   There was a whole, oh, yeah.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.940]   So I was aware of it because, you know,
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.700]   I worked at Mashable and we covered those sorts of things,
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.700]   but I wasn't on it.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.540]   It was shocking to me when it rebranded
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.940]   and then it became so big.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.700]   And, you know, and they executed,
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.140]   to their credit, they executed a hardcore, right?
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.540]   'Cause a lot of it isn't fundamentally that different
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.220]   than Vine except the execution.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.700]   And I also, I think the moment in time was different.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.860]   And the algorithm, that for you is just so good.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.780]   You know, that for you page is just incredibly powerful.
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.140]   And it is kind of scary.
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.500]   You know, I don't know what the solution is,
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.300]   but it does show you like, okay,
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.740]   you take what Facebook and Twitter and Instagram
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.180]   and some of these earlier services started doing,
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.700]   you know, 15 years ago.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.860]   And now this is, you know, taking those learnings,
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.580]   but better and more modern.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.940]   And using better technology behind it
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.420]   and with the audience that largely has never grown up
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:52.460]   without this stuff.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.460]   And so it's right now, as Daniel was kind of saying,
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.300]   like this stuff seems to be good,
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.380]   but it could have just as easily gone bad
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:04.060]   and it could just as easily go bad, right?
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.700]   Like if ByteDance decided to make changes
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.380]   through the algorithm and wasn't about like, you know,
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.900]   - Joy. - Showing joy, exactly.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.100]   If they're showing, okay, well, you know what?
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.740]   People are bored being happy.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.620]   You know, or whatnot.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.140]   And I'm sure that there's some people who's TikTok,
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.500]   'cause that's the interesting thing about TikTok.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.020]   Everyone's TikTok is different.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.060]   It's based on your interest and what you like.
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.140]   I'm sure there are plenty of people
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.140]   who the stuff they see and engage with
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.260]   is not pleasant stuff and is more outrage based.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.340]   And if that became more of the norm,
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.620]   I mean, gosh, that's or more propaganda based
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.660]   or more anything, you know.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.060]   - Well, there is one example.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.380]   - Serving.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.420]   - The middle aged housewife who said,
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.300]   let's all buy tickets to the Trump rally and not show up.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.140]   - Right.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.060]   - In fact, some say that's why the president
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.580]   at the time wanted to kill TikTok.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.420]   - Band them.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.260]   Yeah, no, that was the rumor.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.060]   Yeah, no, and that was hilarious 'cause that went viral
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.780]   'cause they had the free thing and I mean,
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.620]   it was a great troll.
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.900]   - And the Trump had a hundred thousand people.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.500]   - Thought millions would show up at the rally.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.380]   They had an outdoor event area set up
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.980]   'cause they expected so many people and nobody showed up.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:09.820]   It was a great--
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.700]   - Herman Cain still got COVID and died
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.540]   because of that event.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.020]   - But that was an example of TikTok being used
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.340]   politically, probably grassroots.
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.060]   I doubt it was the Chinese government that did that.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.860]   - Oh no, exactly, but I mean,
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.340]   and that's actually an interesting thing to think about.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.740]   Like if governments or if propaganda forces
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.980]   or other things really wanted to use these.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.940]   And I'm not even gonna talk about the US per se.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:33.780]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.660]   - They could mess with us.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:35.940]   - I'm not even thinking of the US per se,
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.660]   but like look at what happened in Myanmar, right?
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.380]   Like what happened there was the government figured out
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.260]   that we can use the power of Facebook and this information.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.740]   And we can spread this and we can create this outrage.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.060]   And you've seen similar things happen in India,
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.180]   which then becomes ironic that the Indian government
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.180]   are being so jealous about each.
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.500]   - But this is an example 'cause it's WhatsApp,
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.860]   which is private messaging and is being used
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.420]   in some horrific ways in India and other countries.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.340]   - Yes, yes.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.700]   - But what do you do about that?
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:03.900]   That's private messaging.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:04.740]   What are you saying?
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.260]   Should Facebook read every WhatsApp message?
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:09.500]   - No, of course not, if anything.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.940]   You know, they're trying to, I mean,
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.980]   that's one of the reasons I think that they're so in favor
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.460]   of encryption, they don't want the responsibility,
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.620]   which I understand.
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.100]   Like, you know, AT&T is not like you could
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.980]   sue the phone company back when AT&T was the only phone
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.020]   system, you couldn't sue them for, you know,
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.180]   the way people use the phone.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.140]   - There's still kids who, common carriers,
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.020]   for what happens on the common carrier.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.220]   You cannot sue a phone company because people
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:37.340]   planned it, you know, the 9/11 attack over the phone.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.580]   They're not responsible for that.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.820]   - Right, right.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.660]   - So really, the problem with Facebook is,
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.300]   we don't know what it is.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.100]   Is it a common carrier?
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:50.660]   Is it a platform or is it a media company?
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:54.060]   If it's a media company, if it's a Fox News or an OANN
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.540]   or an MSNBC, the First Amendment says
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.460]   you can't do anything about it because they're expressing
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.380]   a point of view that's protected by the First Amendment.
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.580]   If they're a social platform that says,
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.180]   no, no, we're not gonna put the finger,
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.780]   our thumbs on the scale, we just wanna connect
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.780]   you with your family members and your loved ones
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.860]   and your high school sweetheart,
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.260]   then that's fine, that's harmless, there's no--
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.780]   - It's all terrible things happen.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.740]   - Right, and they kind of skate because of that whole point
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:23.580]   they can sing with them. - They're right,
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.580]   between aren't they?
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.820]   - Right, because they don't, like,
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.740]   so even on the First Amendment side,
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.540]   there are limits to what you can do
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.460]   under the First Amendment speech, you know,
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.020]   is not entirely free, but because we don't regulate them
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.780]   as that and then the whole section,
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.500]   now we're verging back into section two, third.
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.940]   - I don't think there's much, the government's not done much
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:45.820]   to correct Fox News for COVID misinformation for instance.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:46.660]   - Sure, right.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.820]   - I know, but there are limits to exist,
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.820]   the limits do exist, but they're not, I mean,
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.060]   the bar is high.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.380]   - Yeah. - As it should be.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.980]   - As it should be. - As it should be.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.020]   - Agreed.
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:00.140]   - So this is, maybe that is, maybe there's,
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.180]   that's an interesting choice of words, Daniel,
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.260]   we've been on, they're skating, they're getting by
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:10.460]   by pretending to be a media company when it's convenient,
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.100]   pretending to be a social network when it's convenient.
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.420]   - That's always been their remote, right?
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.940]   Is that's always been the essential question,
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:17.460]   are they a platformer, are they a publisher?
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.940]   That's always been like the essential question.
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:19.780]   - And they're really close to both.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.420]   - Yes, and they are. - They're really close.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.820]   - And they are what they are when it's convenient.
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.540]   I think that where it becomes, I think where
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.020]   even their common carrier stuff,
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.620]   WhatsApp, I think, is an easy common carrier argument
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.660]   to make, although that would open up the regulation.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.340]   I think WhatsApp is very easy to make that.
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.460]   I think Facebook and Instagram are different
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:38.700]   because it does determine, they have a role
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.140]   in their algorithms and in their policies
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:44.220]   and their procedures on what you see and how you see it
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.140]   and what is uplifting and what is not.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:46.980]   - And what?
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.740]   - We also let you pay to amplify things, right?
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.580]   Like you can do, you know, promoted posts,
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.620]   which is a huge part of how people see content.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:54.260]   And that's a huge part of their business.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.500]   And so that to me then takes the common carrier element
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.820]   out of it for those platforms
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.660]   because they are a publisher in those senses, you know?
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.740]   - Yeah, it's not like the phone company said,
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.380]   hey, I think you'd be interested in some more
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.820]   terrorist phone calls, would you like those?
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.660]   - Exactly.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.880]   - They don't do that, they are pure platform.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.580]   Yeah, it's really an interesting, you know,
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.540]   we've never seen anything like this before.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.620]   - The information warfare potential with this stuff
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:21.820]   is just truly frightening.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.740]   As governments become more aware of how you can
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.820]   weaponize this technology, like having a phone
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:31.380]   was one thing, but it's not like, you know,
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.860]   China also then started calling everybody's phone
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.660]   in the United States and being like,
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.820]   you know, the president is bad or something like that.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:38.900]   Like technically that might--
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.820]   - No, we do that internally, we don't need China to help.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.660]   - Right, right.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.060]   But like that didn't happen,
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.260]   but now with these apps and services,
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:50.260]   as soon as countries and governments figure out
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.980]   how they can weaponize this stuff,
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:55.340]   it becomes very dangerous how they can sort of
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.140]   manipulate the algorithm to show content,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.860]   whether to their own people in their country
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:02.740]   or other people in other countries.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.900]   - Ben Thompson makes on Stratecary,
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.460]   is Congress is not gonna regulate Facebook
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:12.100]   because it's too useful to individual members of Congress
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.100]   for their own benefit.
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.580]   - Oh yeah.
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.460]   - So you're never gonna see regulation
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.140]   because governments, he says,
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.060]   that's the thing to really fear, as you say, Daniel,
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.020]   that's the thing to really fear.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:23.660]   Once governments get savvy enough to say,
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.940]   oh, we could use this.
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.300]   That's what happened in Hitler's Germany,
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.220]   Joseph Gebel's the propaganda minister,
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.420]   said the new medium, this new medium of radio,
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:36.500]   this is really useful.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:40.660]   We can really use this, and they did, to great effect.
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:41.940]   Now you've scared me.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.500]   (laughing)
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.500]   Now I'm really worried.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:45.340]   - It is frightening.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.100]   - We haven't seen anything yet in other words.
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:49.740]   - Yep.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.660]   - All right, let's take a break.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.740]   Windows 11 is here, something a little lighter.
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.420]   We're all gonna jump through it.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:56.260]   - Oh, we're fun.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.340]   - We're gonna jump through a painting
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:00.660]   and do a little tap dancing when we come back.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.740]   Daniel Robino actually wanted to jump through the window.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:08.740]   He's ready to jump through his surf into the sand trap
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.940]   that is Windows 11.
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.860]   We're doing that in a second when we continue.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:16.700]   But first a word from our sponsor.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:20.700]   I show today, brought to you by checkout.com.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.860]   Text should not stifle innovation, right?
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.700]   We can agree on that.
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.380]   Unfortunately, text sometimes does,
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.740]   especially when it comes to,
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:32.780]   this is the pain point in e-commerce, payment systems.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:36.540]   Oy, traditional payment systems, heavily layered,
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.700]   disconnected, businesses look at them at a cost center.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.900]   They know it could be done better.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:43.740]   But how?
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.020]   Well, checkout.com.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.420]   Modern businesses need flexible payment systems
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:52.620]   that can help them adapt to change, to grow and scale fast.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.580]   I just found out, I think checkout
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.060]   is one of those things that you're using
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:59.060]   without knowing it, right?
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.900]   They have a tech that approaches payments
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.660]   with a radical new lens.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:07.220]   Check out.com partnered with Oxford Economics.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:09.220]   They conducted an end-to-end analysis
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.420]   of the payments value chain for merchants.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:16.020]   Like one of the big pain points, false declines.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.060]   It happens to me all the time.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:19.220]   I don't know why, I'll try to buy something and say,
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:22.940]   nope, it costs US, UK, French and German markets
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:27.940]   $20.3 billion, $12.7 billion went to competitors,
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.700]   but a horrible $7.6 billion,
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.460]   entirely written off, lost forever.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.960]   The study found that merchants aren't currently optimizing
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.660]   the consumers, I like how they put this,
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:41.780]   significant willingness to pay.
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.300]   I am willing to pay, I'm here.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:47.140]   Take my money for speed, for convenience
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.780]   and security online, take my money
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.900]   and they get declined, come on.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.340]   The majority of merchant survey
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.700]   do not feel their payments data
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:58.460]   is informing their business strategy or their innovation.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.380]   And by the way, when you talk to customers,
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:03.140]   more than half said they won't return to a site
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:06.700]   because the site doesn't offer their preferred payment method.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.940]   Most merchants spend more than 10% of their payments budgets,
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:14.940]   fixing disputes, fraud, outages, CEOs in this survey said,
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:20.740]   you know, oh, we like, we think the quality of data is great.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.420]   You know, they overestimate the quality of data,
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:27.060]   returned by payment providers, CEOs underestimate the extent
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:30.140]   to which disconnected payments are hindering growth.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:33.340]   And when merchants focus on the per transaction costs
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.660]   of their payments, they're missing a very important
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.660]   point back end costs.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.220]   That's why I want you to check out checkout.com.

[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.100]   If you watch the Major League Baseball playoffs,
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.860]   if you watch NFL football,
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.060]   you cannot miss this cookie,
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.340]   and forgive me, Christina, for saying it,
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.740]   "Cookie Microsoft Windows 11 ad."
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.300]   It's cookie.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.940]   That's all I can say.
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.940]   It is.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:26.940]   It's pretty.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.940]   It's artsy.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.940]   It brings you closer to the things you love.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.940]   That's the tagline, huh?
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.220]   Oh, I love Master Chief.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.780]   So Windows 11 came out on October 5th.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.820]   That was a Tuesday.
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:44.820]   I can't-- it wasn't like Windows 95, start me up.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.820]   It wasn't even like Windows 7.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.260]   There were, you know, no parties celebrating the arrival
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.020]   of Windows 11.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.260]   It kind of just-- and there was no hummingbird,
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.100]   I might add, either.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:00.900]   Daniel, was Windows 11 a big deal this week?
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.980]   You know, the idea of an operating system being updated,
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.780]   I think, is just not a big deal anymore.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.780]   Apple has kind of proven this point by every year.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.780]   They do it every year.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.780]   And Android got on that as well.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:19.780]   And people are just so used to probably sick of operating
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:24.780]   system updates that this is not really a big deal in that sense.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:28.500]   Now, where, you know, Windows 95 was big,
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.780]   because the computers were still pretty new,
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.780]   but that was right at the point where they were starting to get big.
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:34.780]   And that's right also, we were just like,
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.780]   "Oh, I'm not going to get a big deal."
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.780]   And that's right also, you know, Windows 95,
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.780]   its core feature was about the internet, right?
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.780]   And there was so much potential around that.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.780]   And this is going to allow you to get on the internet easier,
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:48.780]   because it was pretty difficult and weird at that point to get on the internet.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.780]   So it doesn't quite have that impact after all.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.780]   It's like you were saying about phones, right?
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.780]   We've reached peak operating systems.
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.780]   What are you going to do that's going to be so different?
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.780]   Exactly.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.780]   So, sure, they updated the UI.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.780]   It looks more modern and fresher.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   They did a lot of optimizations.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.780]   It's built around more security,
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:13.780]   which I think is really a bigger story that people don't like talking about,
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.780]   because security is boring.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.780]   When you say that, is that the TPM requirement,
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.780]   the TPM 2.0 requirement, or is there other?
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:23.780]   That as well as the modern processors, you know,
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.780]   where it's certainly...
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.780]   Yeah, execution exploits, you know, the idea here...
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:33.780]   I would say Windows has a couple of problems in terms of image, right?
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.780]   One of them is stability.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.780]   Another one is security.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.780]   And the other one is complexity.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.780]   So, this update addresses all that stuff.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.780]   When it comes to security, yeah, now it requires TPM.
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.780]   It requires modern processors.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.780]   Stuff on the motherboard that helps prevent injection between
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.780]   when the operating system is actually booting up.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.780]   Right.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.780]   And that's boring, and sometimes it angers people,
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.780]   but it's super important when we're getting to different types of malware
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.780]   and you know, hijacking people's computers,
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.780]   it's very important for them to address that.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.780]   After all, I've seen a lot of Google Chrome commercials
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.780]   for Chrome Book where they're like,
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.780]   "You don't need a virus scanner."
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.780]   Yes, same thing.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:18.780]   Because it's still fun to go after Microsoft for security.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.780]   Same thing when it comes to stability, right?
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:25.780]   Blue screen of death is hilarious because it's a cultural need at this point.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.780]   We all know it.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.780]   Which is insane.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.780]   But when you look at the numbers between the...
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.780]   Going by what Microsoft says, right?
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:38.780]   That 99% of the computers with the modern hardware running Windows 11
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.780]   have a crash-free experience.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:42.780]   And that's the way it should be.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:43.780]   But they can't do that.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:46.780]   No, I mean, they say 99%.
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:50.780]   But they didn't say what that number was for Windows 10.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.780]   Could it have been 98.9%?
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.780]   It could have probably wasn't.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.780]   Okay.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.780]   Okay.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:04.780]   Windows 11 is, if you're running it on the approved or recommended hardware,
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.780]   it is very stable.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.780]   Okay.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.780]   I would actually argue...
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.780]   It's been stable for a while though.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   Windows 10 was...
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:15.780]   I mean, the blue screen of death kind of went away, right?
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.780]   Mostly.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.780]   Yeah, it was still kind of there.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.780]   They were supporting a lot of very old hardware with Windows 10.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   And now they're actually making that demarcation.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.780]   That's one way to get rid of them.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.780]   Stop supporting Core demos.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:37.780]   And I would say also, that's kind of the other story this week, which was kind of boring because
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.780]   it weren't celebrations.
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:44.780]   Because I don't have to write a bunch of stories talking about this is broken, this is crash,
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.780]   this isn't working for people.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.780]   Sure, there's the AMD story.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:54.780]   Oh, you know, a 3-5% maybe reduction in performance on very specific applications and maybe in gaming.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.780]   And that's going to be fixed in a couple of weeks.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:03.380]   But that's not the same as people's, you know, computers being wiped or losing data, things
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.780]   being locked out or crashing.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:11.300]   Like, it's actually been a boring week in terms of major bugs with Windows 11, which I think
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:16.460]   speaks to all this work that they put into making Windows a little bit more modern.
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:22.740]   That's actually a little surprising because the beta releases were somewhat buggy.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:28.420]   And I think Paul Therat was saying, I'm worried that this Windows 11 releases premature.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.940]   But it had a major bug just a couple of weeks ago.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940]   That was right.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.940]   Took away people start the taskbar.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.940]   Right.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:35.940]   You could do it.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:36.940]   It was not good.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.940]   Right.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:38.940]   But we haven't seen anything like that this week.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.940]   No.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.940]   That's good news.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.940]   Nope.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:42.940]   Tell me about the rise in.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.180]   Tell me about the rise in issue.
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.300]   Who does that affect?
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:52.620]   So this is very, you know, first of all, AMD users are still a minority of users in general.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:55.420]   So it's a certain percentage of them.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:06:00.620]   And the effect appears to be a three, maybe three to five percent, less than three to
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:07.220]   five percent reduction in performance in specific application slash some games.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.220]   And why?
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.220]   That's it.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.220]   Do we know why?
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.220]   It has to do with the L3 memory.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.740]   It has to do with memory in the architecture of AMD chips.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.900]   It's going to be dressed in a couple of weeks, apparently.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.940]   But it's not a security vulnerability.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.300]   Most people aren't going to notice it.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.100]   It's just, I think, a more retighting up kind of bug.
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.580]   It's surprising they missed it during the beta testing period.
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:31.020]   So I'm sure people will go back and look at what happened.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:35.020]   Only reason I'm asking is because I run a rise in 15, 900 on my own computer.
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.020]   So I'm just curious.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.580]   Actually, I don't know.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.620]   You're a hardcore gamer who streams on Twitch.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.860]   You may want to hold back.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.860]   No, I notice a little.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.180]   I don't notice any difference.
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:48.500]   It seems the same, but I'm playing Valheim, which is not exactly the most challenging game
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.500]   ever.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.500]   There we go.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.780]   And I stream it on Twitch.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:57.300]   And thanks to the big Twitch breach, I'm streaming to a lot more people than ever.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.300]   Yes.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.900]   We'll talk about that a little bit.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.900]   Okay.
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.700]   So, Christina, did you put Windows 11 on your brand new framework?
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.900]   Or did you put Windows 10 on?
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:07.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.900]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:13.780]   I've been running 11 since I've been on internal stuff, I guess, since like May.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.820]   And you're the insiders insider.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.820]   You're really insane.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:18.820]   Yeah.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.740]   I haven't worked on the product or anything, but I was just as a disclosure.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:27.620]   I was involved with the developer launch event that happened back in June.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:30.420]   And I have great respect for the Windows team, but I don't work on Windows.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:34.260]   But, yeah, no, I've been running it, I guess, for, yeah, almost six months at this point.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.100]   And I love it.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.940]   I love the UI changes.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:43.300]   It was interesting going through the dev process and seeing how things were being added back
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.260]   and how more features were being refined.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.980]   Obviously, this is still, I think, just kind of like a, you know, work in progress, kind
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.980]   of like Windows 10 didn't come.
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:55.700]   Like there were all soft reviews.
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:56.700]   That's the new thing.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.660]   No software ships done.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.660]   And it started with gaming.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.660]   Yeah, right.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.900]   It started with actually a marriage of fall.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:08.020]   I said, no, it started with Google with Gmail, which was in beta for a decade.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:10.060]   Software hasn't done anymore.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.060]   It ships.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:14.540]   And then there are many, many patches over a period of time as it gets better and better.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.180]   But 11 seems fairly stable.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.180]   I think it's beautiful.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.620]   I have to say, I like it.
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:23.100]   I don't mind the centered menu.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.100]   They need to do a little work.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.820]   And I'm sure will on the start menu.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:32.060]   The recent thing is a little, or whatever they call it, recommend is a little big.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.900]   But there's little things like that.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.060]   And I'm sure Stardock will allow you to tweak it.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:40.020]   Jim Salter, and you would expect this from Jim in ours, Technica says the best part of
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.820]   Windows 11 Linux.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:42.820]   WSL 2.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:43.820]   Absolutely.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.060]   But WSL 2 is amazing.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:50.540]   But a huge part of this, Windows Terminal is now installed by default.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:54.540]   Oh, that's not so much better terminal than the old CMD terminal.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.380]   This is so good.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:59.300]   But also installing WSL is super easy now.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.820]   You just type in WSL dash dash install.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.820]   It enables everything for you.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:06.940]   So even getting that enabled now is super easy.
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:11.940]   It's easy to get the Windows package manager installed, which is basically like the Windows
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.300]   version of Homebrew, essentially.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.500]   Oh, so I don't need to use chocolate anymore.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.980]   There's a package manager.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.260]   But there is a package manager.
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:23.140]   And what's cool about it is it's actually tied to the Windows Store, but also non-Windows
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.100]   Store apps can be packaged that way too.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.100]   But you can install, I mean, it's in a lot of ways, just to see a life for the Windows
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.860]   Store, but also for other things that want to package that way.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:37.540]   Chocolatey still has some advantages for certain types of NuGet and maybe dev things.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.660]   But I can do a lot of stuff with the Windows package manager now, and I love it.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:47.260]   You know, Power Toys, which is an add-on you can get and it's open sourced, adds even
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:50.180]   more kind of good stuff.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:54.420]   For people who are more like dev-centric kind of nerdy users, like us.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.420]   Your users, yeah.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:59.740]   And everybody kind of thinking most of the audience on the show, there's a lot of really
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.020]   good stuff with this.
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:05.460]   And the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which Jim Salzer mentioned, one of the big things.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:10.300]   And this will be coming to Windows 10 as well, but it's already in the stuff that's in Windows
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:18.060]   11, is the early support for graphical apps within WSL.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:25.020]   So if you wanted to run Firefox installed from Ubuntu or another distro, you could.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:28.820]   Or if there was another GUI app that for whatever reason you wanted to run, you could
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.820]   do that.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.820]   That's actually huge.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.820]   And it works really well.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:34.180]   And you don't have to just go through installing X-Window ahead of time.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.940]   You just install the GUI app and it works.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.940]   Exactly.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.780]   And there's some limitations and there's some things that aren't quite there yet.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.300]   That's obviously the teams are working hard on that.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.580]   But there's a lot of opportunity there.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:50.220]   One of the interesting things in that case is when it comes to CUDA workflows.
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:56.820]   So CUDA is an NVIDIA's proprietary kind of technology that most data scientists and
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.180]   a lot of other big workloads use.
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:04.820]   And a lot of people really like to use CUDA stuff, but they would want to be able to use
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.980]   that kind of on the Linux side to use their GPU power.
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:08.980]   And you can.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:13.900]   And you can have the pass through and do a lot of CUDA stuff within WSL, which is really
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.460]   powerful for a lot of engineers.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:21.500]   So that support, again, is still becoming enhanced and NVIDIA has added driver support
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.500]   and stuff like that.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.580]   But it's the opportunities there.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.420]   I think I love WSL.
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:31.340]   It's one of my favorite features in the last few years that it's been available.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:36.420]   And I use it all the time and the newest versions and the GUI stuff, I think, for people who
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:40.500]   like, OK, you have games and maybe you have some apps where you like the interface, whatever
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.460]   the case may be, you like the Windows operating system better.
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:47.100]   But if you're doing dev work, you would really like to be in a Linux environment.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:53.180]   The way that it's coming together now makes it much more seamless and I think really good.
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:56.860]   You'll be glad to know Jim Salter installed it on a framework laptop.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:57.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:58.860]   I'm not surprised.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:03.140]   Before the show, we were talking about how much Christina and I love our frameworks, the
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:06.500]   right to repair laptop.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:07.940]   I want to talk about the package manager.
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.020]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.020]   Wingit.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:17.060]   For years, Linux installs have always had something called a package manager for Ubuntu, its
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:23.740]   app to apt get for ARCH, its Pac-Man, which makes it very easy to update the operating
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.380]   system, but also install new apps.
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:30.540]   And if you install new apps through the package manager, which most Linux users do, keep those
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.580]   apps up to date.
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:36.060]   It's just a really nice way of doing things.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.100]   Windows has never had a first party package manager.
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:43.180]   We mentioned chocolatey and NuGet, but they were very limited.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:46.660]   They were more like nightnight than real package managers.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.540]   I think it's interesting, Microsoft.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:51.580]   Does Wingit work outside of WSL?
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.580]   Can you use it as a...
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.820]   So it's just a command line only though right now.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:56.820]   It's a command line only.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:00.620]   Yeah, no, because the GUI equivalent would be the Microsoft Store.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:02.420]   But there's stuff in it.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.220]   Oh, God, you're hurting me.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:10.620]   No, no, no, no, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:15.380]   A, the Microsoft Store has been revamped as getting a lot better, but B, and this is important,
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.420]   you can install stuff that's not in the Microsoft Store.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:22.620]   So people can still add and package things specifically within Wingit in other ways,
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:27.340]   and it'll download it through their direct binaries and update them through that process.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:28.340]   It's very similar.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:35.340]   I would say, you know, Pac-Man app is probably not the best analogy, probably Homebrew is
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.340]   the best analogy.
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.420]   On the Mac, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.140]   Because, which is also on Linux now too.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:46.340]   And the reason I say that is because the main painters themselves, like, arches a little
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:51.220]   bit different, but like with, you know, Debian Ubuntu and Red Hat stuff, typically the stuff
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:54.540]   is added and is, you know, you have package maintainers who are adding them to the catalog
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:56.740]   and making sure things are updated and whatnot.
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:01.660]   Whereas with Homebrew, you know, somebody adds a config file and it's getting it directly
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:05.020]   from the source itself and then installing it.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.540]   And that's what, how, how Wingit works.
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.540]   And it's really good.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.620]   So Wingit, is it building every time?
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.420]   Does it install binaries or is it?
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.620]   It's getting binaries, right?
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:18.260]   So if I do Wingit install, whatever, then it's going to go to wherever it needs to install
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.260]   it.
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:22.580]   And then it's from the Windows Store, maybe it's getting it from a direct, you know, download
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:25.620]   location, maybe it's getting it from GitHub.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.820]   And then it's installing, you know, and doing the update process.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.900]   If you're doing an upgrade or whatever.
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.900]   Daniel, you defend the Windows Store.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.740]   It's no longer the repository of crap apps.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.300]   Yeah, I mean, it was, right?
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.260]   I mean, it couldn't get any worse.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:49.060]   But I interviewed the head of the new store, George Joe Sartio, Sartio.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.860]   Yes, George Joe.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.860]   George Joe is great.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.620]   And he's a, yeah, he's very, so he wasn't part of the store.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:03.540]   He came from a different engineering background, but he, like a lot of people, had ideas of
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.340]   what the store should be.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:10.460]   And so he wrote a white paper saying this is how I think the store should be designed
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:13.500]   and how it should be run and what the focus should be.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.860]   And he started apparently circulating it internally at Microsoft.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.620]   A lot of other people agreed with him.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:23.860]   And somehow he eventually got, Microsoft was like, all right, go for it.
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:26.740]   You know, basically it couldn't get any worse, right?
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:29.900]   Because the store up to that point did have a lot of problems.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.940]   Mostly a lot of it related to phone, of course.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:37.340]   And then the bigger concept here, we're going to make phone apps like Iran desktop.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:40.980]   One's phone went away, that first, you know, falls apart.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:47.100]   So he completely redid the store and his philosophy was get the economics out of this.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.980]   The store should focus on two things, customers and developers.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:50.980]   And that's all that matters.
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.700]   And we've got to bring those two people, those two groups together.
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:16:00.460]   And so he started from that concept and then he went and hired a team to make this happen.
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.820]   And he basically went around the world.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:07.300]   There's people from China, this South Africa, there's India, there's United States and Europe.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:14.220]   And he hired a lot of people who weren't traditional store devs, but they were very good devs,
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:16.460]   basically, and brought them together.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.900]   And we did the store entirely.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.660]   During this process, they did things like get rid of a lot of monetization stuff, especially
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:27.340]   around, you know, apps and taking a large percentage cut.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.700]   They cut their cut significantly, right?
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.900]   It's 12% for games.
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.500]   And yeah, did they say one percent for non-games?
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.460]   They said it's very low now.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:40.100]   Yeah, it's really not the focus of the store anymore.
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:45.700]   The store is about you click it in a way to connect customers to developers.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.180]   It's a package manager.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.180]   So your...
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.020]   So Christina said it was right.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:53.020]   It's more of a package manager than a revenue storefront.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.820]   At this point, at this point, it shifted that way.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:56.820]   It's really interesting.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:04.060]   Because like you don't even need to wrap your app in, was it MSIX, which is the traditional
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.060]   store wrapper.
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:09.740]   So you can just list a Win32 classic app in there.
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.740]   And it uses the...
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:16.380]   So WinZip, when you go and download WinZip from the Microsoft Store, uses WinZip's installer.
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:19.140]   And it looks like it's 1995 again.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.060]   And so devs can just do that.
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:24.580]   Just basically, that's the Epic Store is now in the Microsoft Store.
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:27.500]   And all it is is a Win32 setup installer.
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:33.140]   Now if devs wants, they can take that and then put it into MSIX and then get the store
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.420]   features.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:39.820]   And then further down the line, they can go with WinUI and use Project Reunion to basically
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:42.660]   modernize the app if they want to.
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.500]   And the idea is you take them down this path and someone can even do a UWP app if they really
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.980]   wanted to or do a WebView PWA type style.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:58.060]   So Microsoft is giving developers a ton of options, almost no friction to the store.
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:17:59.060]   And that's really changed things.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.220]   If you open the store right now for Windows 11, it's kind of crazy.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:08.740]   I mean, there's Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, there's the course Spotify, there's iTunes.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.060]   There's just all these...
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.820]   There's TikTok is in there.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:16.340]   There's like all these mainstream apps that are now listed in a Ted Mormon...
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:17.340]   Photoshop.
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:18.340]   More momentum.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:19.340]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:20.340]   Photoshop is in there.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.340]   Adobe is in there.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:25.180]   But even more than that, Microsoft has said we're going to add Android apps to the store.
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:29.740]   And we're going to let anybody else, like Epic, for instance, put their own store in
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.620]   the store.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.620]   It's already there.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.620]   Which is bizarre.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:39.220]   Apple would never do that.
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:40.220]   That's really...
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:44.460]   So it's a complete contextual change for what the store means to Windows.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:46.580]   And it sounds like for a very positive.
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.540]   They're going to have to convince people.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.020]   They had a lot of...
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.620]   They've had more wins this summer and even the last couple of weeks.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:55.980]   And just this week Disney Plus joined in.
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:01.540]   And not only did Disney Plus join in, they did this really clever idea that...
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.780]   It's very consumer friendly.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:07.460]   When you search for movies and TV, say Cruella, you find it in the store.
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.220]   It gives you the opportunity to buy the movie if you want or rent the movie and you pay
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.660]   through Microsoft if you want to do that.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.900]   But there will also be a Disney Plus button listed there.
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:20.500]   And if you click that button, if you don't have the app installed, it'll install it for
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.500]   you if you want to.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:25.820]   If you already have it installed and you click it, it just goes into your Disney Plus account,
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.940]   it goes to Cruella and says, "You can stream this for free."
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:34.700]   And so that's going to be very important because right now we're so overloaded with streaming
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:38.620]   features and services that we don't know where to watch the content.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:43.900]   Why should I pay Microsoft to rent it when I can get it free through Disney Plus?
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:44.900]   So that's what they're doing.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:49.580]   So we may eventually see Amazon Prime there, maybe Voodoo, maybe Apple.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.700]   That's super consumer friendly because that's exactly what a consumer does.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:57.060]   I want to watch Cruella.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.300]   But they don't search the store.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:03.100]   Now they got to search the web and figure out, "How do I get it?"
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.100]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.900]   Whereas if you just search in the store, there's the movie.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.900]   "Oh, it's Disney Plus."
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:10.420]   You press the button, Disney Plus installs, and it runs.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.620]   I think that's really smart of Microsoft to do that.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.420]   So they're just doing a lot of these really clever ideas.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.900]   They even have now their pop-up store, they call it.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:24.940]   So when a developer has an app, they take the embed code for that app to list it.
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:26.980]   They can put it into a webpage.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:31.460]   Download it at Microsoft, you'll go to Voodoo or something like that, and they'll have their
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.460]   app.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:37.180]   But now when you click that button, instead of it launching into a webpage, which then
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:41.460]   allows you to launch into the store, then allows you to go download, it literally pops
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:47.540]   up a mini store with the app title, the description, and install button.
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.340]   You just hit install right there.
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:52.780]   It doesn't even take you out of the experience of whatever you're doing at that moment.
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.060]   It just installs directly.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.900]   So they're doing a lot of improvements here.
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.620]   The way the app's download has been improved.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.820]   Windows Update has been overhauled too.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.420]   The way it downloads.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:05.260]   Now it doesn't need to download the entire update.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:10.100]   It only downloads the difference between what's on your computer already and what is in the
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.100]   update.
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.260]   So if it's redundant, it doesn't download that.
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:17.620]   On top of it, it installs in the background, much like a smartphone does, with a parallel
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:22.180]   install, so that when it reboots the computer, you're basically just swapping out one partition
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:24.820]   for the other, and then you're just back into it.
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:27.660]   You're not going to have like 10 minutes of updates going on.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:31.500]   So there's a lot of architectural changes here, getting Android apps to run, but they're
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.060]   still skeptical of how useful they're going to be.
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:38.260]   That was supposed to come with Windows 11, but it is delayed.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.740]   You got to push back.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:41.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:47.820]   But the idea of running Android apps, Linux apps, EWA's, Win32, UWP.
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.420]   Like you could just run it all side by side, and it's going to be seamless experience.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:54.420]   Like what operating system does that today?
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:59.300]   I think it's a very significant change, both in philosophy and the architecture of what
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:00.300]   Windows 11 is.
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:04.740]   I think a lot of people sort of just, you know, they focus on just, oh, the task bar
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.300]   looks new, and it's like, it's a lot more going on here.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:13.740]   I think a lot of more sophisticated users are very aware of how containers have changed
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:20.140]   how we use computers, where the operating system really is just a holder for whatever
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.140]   you want to do.
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.940]   And it sounds like Microsoft, Microsoft is very aware of this.
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.860]   You know, with Hyper-V and so forth.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.700]   They've been very aware of virtualization.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:31.180]   They're very aware of Docker and other container technologies.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:35.980]   It actually makes sense for Microsoft to say, hey, we don't, we're kind of platform agnostic.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:41.740]   We are, we're just the floor that you put stuff on top of.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.860]   And that's actually a smart move for Microsoft.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.860]   I think that's very interesting.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.380]   Dan, do you imagine Apple?
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.300]   I don't, it's interesting because Apple's Mac.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.300]   Yeah, no.
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:51.300]   The answer is no.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.100]   Apple's Mac store is much more like that.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.900]   It's much more like a package manager.
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:01.020]   On the other hand, the App Store on iOS is all about revenue.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:04.940]   That's in fact, Apple's future in terms of revenue.
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.380]   That's where, I mean, they make so much money.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:10.380]   And I mean, I don't know enough about the Microsoft end of things to know.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:13.500]   Was that perhaps not performing as a revenue source?
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.500]   Guarantee.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.500]   It was not.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.420]   There's an advantage to them to lose, right?
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:24.980]   For Apple, there's so much revenue that comes in via, especially the iOS App Store, that
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.700]   trying to shift stuff in that direction.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.740]   I don't think really behooves them in any way.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:33.940]   But that is the subject of contention in many different places right now.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:34.940]   Oh, yes.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:35.940]   What is Apple's?
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:36.940]   That kind of shakes out.
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:38.940]   Do you know what Apple's attitude towards homebrew is?
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:45.420]   I mean, that's a third party command line app that lets you install many, many command
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:51.580]   line app and actually to be fair, gooey apps, almost, I think, all serious Mac users use
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:57.420]   some form of package manager, if not homebrew, maybe Mac ports or Fink or something like that.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.020]   Do you think Apple, they certainly don't stop it?
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:01.020]   Do you think they?
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.980]   No, I don't think they have anything against it.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:07.260]   And especially because the Mac as a platform is so different in terms of, and they tried
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:09.900]   to make this case in the whole epic trial, right?
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:12.260]   That the Mac is a different platform from iOS.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:13.980]   iOS, obviously, locked down.
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:18.900]   The Mac has always been, at least under Mac OS X, based on the BSD underpinnings.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:24.740]   Let's face it, Craig Federighi threw the Mac under the bus during the trial saying,
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:26.660]   "Well, you wouldn't want to protect their revenue."
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:30.020]   You wouldn't want the iPhone to be as insecure as our Mac, would you?
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:31.020]   Right.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.020]   That's, did everybody a lot of favors there.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.020]   Oh, boy.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:37.260]   I mean, I don't think they have anything against things like homebrew, honestly.
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:42.180]   I mean, and I think probably most of the people who actually work on Mac OS, certainly, I
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.940]   am sure rely on it.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:44.940]   I mean, for a lot of stuff.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:45.940]   So, yeah.
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:50.700]   It's, Apple's in an interesting position because developers do love Macintosh, and they love
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:55.820]   it because it's a Unix underneath and you can do things like brew.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:59.460]   But at the same time, Apple's moving kind of in the opposite direction of more and more
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:04.660]   tightly controlling the OS, perhaps for security reasons.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:08.020]   I think there's a good argument that it's more secure and Gatekeeper is becoming more
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.620]   important.
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:13.620]   And that is kind of an opposite direction from what developers want.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:17.060]   How do they, and it's interesting, Microsoft moved towards developers.
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:18.620]   WSL is for developers.
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.860]   That's what it's for.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.620]   Hoping to keep these developers from Linux, you know, keeping the music.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.620]   Or for Mac, right?
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.620]   Or, you know, Mac.
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:28.620]   Right.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:32.740]   Like, like, honestly, it's, I think it's a reflection and kind of an understanding that
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.820]   this is how people develop now.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:39.580]   And, you know, you need to have some sort of, you know, Unix or Unix-like system underpinnings
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:44.860]   if you're interacting with the cloud or servers or whatever the case may be.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.220]   And so that's why WSL makes sense.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.940]   And that's why many of us have been Mac OS users for so long.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:51.940]   Absolutely.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.940]   You know, it was Unix, right?
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.460]   Like, that was the fundamental thing.
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:56.580]   It was a huge benefit too, right?
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:02.140]   Coming off classic Mac OS, which, you know, let's be frank, was not a super reliable stable
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.060]   operating system in many, many ways.
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:10.100]   So the Mac OS X reinvention, the fact that it was based on BSD underneath really gave
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.100]   it a lot of credence.
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:15.300]   And it gave a lot of flexibility and a lot of familiarity for people who were coming in
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:19.500]   from that end of the developer spectrum because all the tools that you need are there and
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.100]   all the tools that you're used to are there.
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.020]   And I mean, you can run a web server by spinning it up, right?
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.980]   That was a big deal back in that day.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:30.980]   And I think it still does them favors right now to have those underpinnings there and
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:34.980]   for them to be open, even if they are still building in more stuff like the system integrity
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:39.100]   protection and stuff like that, because you can't ignore the security aspects as well.
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:40.700]   It's a balancing act.
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:47.020]   And as somebody who likes the geeky side of the Apple equation, the Unix side and so forth,
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.100]   I hope they don't go too far in the other direction.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.060]   But so far they've, I think, done a good job.
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:52.060]   You and me both.
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:53.060]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:56.140]   And I don't know, you know, how actively Apple works with the homebrew team.
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:01.420]   I do know that when the M1 came out that they did work with them to make sure it wasn't
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.100]   compatible at first and they had to make it work.
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:05.100]   Right.
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.460]   And they knew and they recognized like Docker was another one of those things.
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:09.460]   Okay.
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:12.820]   And Docker took some time because that was a little more difficult having to get the different
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:18.580]   hypervisor, you know, kit, hyper kit or whatever, you know, working because they changed how
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.220]   also some of the virtualization stuff worked with M1.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:26.020]   But yeah, you know, the homebrew team did have, I know, like direct, like contact to make
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.020]   sure that worked.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:31.260]   And there were some compatibility issues at first, but it was actually remarkably quick
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.740]   how fast that turned out.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.380]   So, you know, which is good.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:38.100]   There was just a thing this past week too about them getting the Linux basically being
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:40.580]   usable on the M1 kind of as a.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:41.580]   Yeah, but that's one of the first.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:42.580]   Not with Apple's cooperation.
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.580]   That is a good.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.580]   No, not at all.
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:45.580]   Certainly not.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.580]   But like the fact that it's still possible.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.580]   Is amazing.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.580]   It indicates a certain level of.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:55.660]   I'd far prefer to run Linux on Mac and Apple Silicon than Intel if I could.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:56.660]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:58.580]   I mean, the challenge isn't even the way that it is now.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.180]   It's usable, but it's still emulated.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.220]   Like they don't have the graphical drivers.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:03.220]   They may not.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.220]   It's not.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:05.220]   It's the problem.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:09.900]   I mean, I mean, this was, and this was the thing that, you know, at least historically,
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:13.860]   you did have people who would find ways to reverse engineer and kind of bring like in
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:19.020]   the pre X86, the pre Intel Mac days, you know, you've had people who would would find ways
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:23.660]   to have, you know, Mac specific, you know, power PC specific Linux distros and stuff
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:24.660]   like that.
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:28.100]   But a lot of most people, I think at least that I always hung out with and obviously
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:32.020]   the Linux ecosystem was different than two is like, well, why do I need to bother with
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.020]   that?
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:35.860]   I can use, you know, Fink or Mac ports, which is what you use back then, you know, when
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:39.660]   I can install my tooling and I have an actual, you know, Unix kernel.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:40.660]   So screw it.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.060]   Like I've got everything I need.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:49.860]   There is now the challenge with like this custom architecture is that we had this great, you
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:54.460]   know, 15 year period where you could do so much on the Mac platform because it used the
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.020]   Intel architecture.
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:59.540]   And so you had common drivers that you could use, you know, if you wanted to boot Windows,
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.420]   you could, if you wanted to boot, you know, Linux, you could, if you wanted to boot weird
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.860]   at more esoteric, you know, OS's you could because the driver models were going to be
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:07.860]   more available.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:11.820]   And now we've gone to this place where if you wanted to be bare metal anyway, you're
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:16.580]   going to have to reverse engineer it unless Apple decides to open up the driver model,
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:19.780]   which let's be honest, they're not going to do it.
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:22.580]   I mean, it's always, it always has a certain niche to it, right?
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:25.780]   Like, I mean, most people who are buying Apple hardware are buying Apple hardware to use
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:26.780]   Mac OS.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:27.780]   That's a big part of the equation.
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:28.780]   Absolutely.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:29.780]   So now for sure.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:30.780]   It was absolutely.
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.980]   Well, Mossberg said the best Windows machine is a MacBook Pro.
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:36.140]   Well, it wasn't wrong for a long time.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:37.140]   That was true.
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.140]   Right.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:41.140]   So about 2015 it really was.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:42.900]   Actually, I want to talk about the surfaces a little bit.
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.900]   There is a fascinating anecdote.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:51.220]   Steve Michael Dell just put out his memoir, "Play Nice, But Win."
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.540]   And he talks about Steve Jobs.
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:57.820]   And he says Steve Jobs, when he came back to Apple, remember he brought the next operating
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:05.900]   system to Apple and the first iterations of Mac OS 10, he wanted Dell to license OS
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.220]   10 and ship it.
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:13.220]   What am I?
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:17.820]   Well, I guess Michael Dell said no because it didn't happen.
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:20.100]   He says he and Jobs are good friends.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:25.220]   There's actually some very positive stuff about Steve Jobs.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.780]   Here we are in the 10th anniversary of his passing.
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:28.780]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:35.500]   What he said was that Apple wanted them to pay a licensing fee for every Dell machine
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.500]   they sold.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.500]   Oh.
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.500]   And not every machine that was happening.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.340]   Because it could run Rhapsody.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:45.340]   It could run Rhapsody so you really ought to pay us for everyone.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:48.740]   And so Michael Dell was like, thank you but no thank you.
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:49.740]   He also said that--
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:50.740]   I mean, good.
[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:51.740]   Classic Steve Jobs.
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:52.740]   Which was--
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:53.740]   Classic Steve Jobs.
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:59.860]   Also, he would refuse to guarantee, at least this is what the memoir excerpt that I read
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:05.220]   said, like he wouldn't agree to a guarantee how long support would actually exist.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:09.940]   So you could have entered into the scenario which this would have been classic Apple.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:14.140]   Where yeah, you can run OS 10.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.740]   The timeline seems a little off for it to be OS 10.
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:19.580]   But Mac OS, you can run it on your Dell.
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:22.020]   But two years later, support ends.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:24.860]   Oh, if you want to continue using those Mac apps in love, you're going to have to spend
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.980]   up and buy a new iBook or whatever.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:29.460]   There wasn't any support length.
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:34.620]   Which incidentally, that was a decision that HP and Carly Fiorina did not make when they
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:38.460]   made the stupid co-brating thing with the iPod to get--
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:39.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.460]   Which really--
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.300]   The HP iPod, yeah.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:46.540]   Which really all that was was that was a cool on Steve Jobs part because that got iTunes
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:50.860]   pre-installed on every single HP and compact desktop.
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:52.020]   So that was what that was about.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:55.180]   He didn't care anything about the 100 or 200,000 iPods.
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:57.500]   They would sell through HP channels who cares.
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.860]   They were selling more than they could make.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:03.820]   But even in that scenario, it was about getting iTunes pre-installed on those machines.
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:04.820]   It was a great point.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:09.260]   But even in that case, they only did one model.
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:11.300]   I think it was the Gen 3 or the Gen 4.
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:12.300]   Oh, it was crap.
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:13.300]   It was terrible.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:14.300]   No, no, it wasn't crappy.
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:15.300]   It was an iPod.
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.300]   It just had an HP logo on the back.
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:17.300]   Well, that's what was crappy.
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.300]   It was the Gen 4 iPod.
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:21.100]   But it was the Gen 4 iPod.
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:24.860]   And when they came out with the iPod photo and the iPod video, oh, that HP partnership
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:25.860]   went away.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:27.780]   Oh, but thanks for pre-installing iTunes on all those computers.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:28.780]   We got what we wanted.
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:29.780]   It's really computers you sold.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.780]   Thanks so much.
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:37.580]   So this is from the Del's memoir.
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.180]   He said, look at this.
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:40.900]   Steve Jobs said, we've got this Dell desktop.
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:41.900]   It's running Mac OS.
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.220]   Why don't you license the Mac OS?
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.700]   Michael Dell says, I thought it was a great idea.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:50.100]   I'll pay you a license fee for every PC we sell with Mac OS.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.940]   Jobs said, no, no, no.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:53.900]   That could undermine our own Mac sales.
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:58.220]   Remember, at this time, Apple-- Steve cut it off, but Apple was selling compatible, allowing
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:02.300]   compatibles because Dell computers were less costly.
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:06.460]   Instead, Dell says, Jobs suggested, oh, here's what you do.
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:11.340]   Every Dell you sell, you put Mac OS and Windows on and you let the consumer decide, oh, and
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:15.500]   by the way, you'll have to pay us for every Dell you sell.
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:19.820]   But to be fair, at least it did come with Mac OS on it.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:20.820]   Dell says the--
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:21.820]   Well, there were no apps then.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:22.820]   I mean, like it would have been a disaster.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.620]   It would have been a huge coup for Apple.
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:25.620]   Apple would have made billions at all.
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:26.620]   It was--
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:27.620]   I think it's exactly--
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:28.620]   It sells out of a hole.
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:29.620]   Yeah, they needed the money.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.620]   Totally.
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:31.620]   Anybody?
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:34.140]   I mean, that's the quintessential Steve Jobs story.
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:35.140]   And it was brilliant.
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:38.500]   Like, if you've been able to get them to agree with it, but Michael Dell was smarter than
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:41.380]   Carly Fiorina, so he did not.
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:44.900]   Dell writes, the royalty he was talking about would amount to hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:48.820]   and the math just didn't work because most of our customers, especially larger business
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:52.020]   customers, didn't really want the Mac operating system.
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:55.020]   Steve's proposal would have been interesting if it was just us saying, okay, we'll pay
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.580]   you every time we use Mac OS, but to pay him for every time we didn't.
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:58.580]   We didn't use it.
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:02.860]   Well, nice try, Steve.
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:04.900]   I think I will be reading this when it comes out.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:08.460]   Michael Dell is an interesting guy and he's much more frank than you would expect from
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:10.740]   a typical CEO memoir.
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.380]   Let's take a little break.
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:15.260]   I do want to talk about the Surface hardware.
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:17.500]   We got to talk about the Twitch hack.
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:21.220]   As I said, this was a very busy week.
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:23.940]   And Apple's appealing the epic decision.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:27.180]   Well, I'll ask you, Dan, about what you think is going to happen there.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:30.740]   So lots more to talk about with our great panel from sixcolors.com.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:33.620]   Dan Morin, always a pleasure to have you on.
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:38.900]   He's calling from Summerfield, Massachusetts, just down the road from Worcester, Daniel
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:44.060]   Ribino, executive editor at Windows Central, Worcester Mass, Summerville Mass, and then up
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:51.460]   from Seattle is a senior cloud advocate, perfectly titled for some may lives in Seattle at Microsoft.
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:52.460]   Christina Warren.
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.460]   It's slowly blinding people.
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:57.100]   I want to say it does not look cloudy.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.100]   I'm not going to say it's a good thing right now in Seattle.
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.100]   The sun is...
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.100]   No, no, it's a...
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:03.340]   In my blinds, my blinds are drawn, but I'm going to have to adjust them.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.340]   Sorry about that.
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.340]   It's okay.
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:06.340]   It's this time of day.
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:07.340]   Take a break.
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:12.500]   You can adjust your blinds while I tell everybody about ESET, which is our favorite antivirus.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:13.500]   You know me.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:18.580]   I'm not a fan of antiviruses, but I have to tell you, we have systems in our office that
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:20.460]   I'm very worried about.
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.940]   Ransomware is a big problem these days, right?
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:27.060]   And the last thing I want to do is come into work and find out a whole network is down
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.340]   because we got hit by ransomware and they want a million dollars in Bitcoin.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:35.140]   Every time I see your IT guy rustle, I say rustle, are we safe?
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.580]   He says, we're safe.
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:37.580]   We're running ESET.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:38.880]   I said, really?
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:43.140]   Our editor is, it turns out, because once you get a stable system, they're running on
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:47.180]   beautiful Dell Precision Workstations, running Windows 8.1.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:48.180]   Whoops.
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:55.140]   And we don't want to upgrade them to Windows 10 or Windows 11 because it's working.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.540]   So we put ESET on there.
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:57.540]   Why ESET?
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:00.580]   Because ESET is so lightweight, it doesn't slow them down.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:07.980]   Look at when you're editing video, you can't dedicate CPU cycles to anything but the job
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:08.980]   at hand.
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:11.820]   ESET is notorious for being super lightweight.
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:16.180]   They're the global leaders in cybersecurity research and innovations.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:19.780]   They've been our security provider at Twit for years.
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:23.860]   And one of the reasons we choose them is because I'm still to death of ransomware.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.500]   Look, this is October.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:29.580]   It's cybersecurity awareness month.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:34.100]   This would be a good time to talk a little bit about how ransomware is affecting everybody.
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:39.060]   It's not only proliferating, it's become, I think, so much more sophisticated because
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.500]   there's so much money to be made.
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:46.660]   So the bad guys are creating brand new strains all the time to get around detection.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:50.300]   If they can hit you, it's big box.
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:54.540]   These kinds of evolving threats require a dynamic approach to detection.
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:55.580]   It has to be faster.
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:58.980]   It has to be more precise than conventional endpoint protection.
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:02.180]   And most importantly, it has to adapt.
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:07.780]   It has to be able to find ransomware it's never seen before.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:11.260]   That's why ESET uses dynamic threat defense.
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:12.260]   EDTD.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:13.660]   It's a cloud base.
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:15.220]   This is so brilliant.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:17.620]   Cloud-based sandboxing technology.
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:23.540]   When you get an attachment in your email, when our editors are getting attachments, files
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:31.540]   coming in, before they can even see them, ESET is uploading them to a cloud-based sandbox
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:36.020]   and testing them before they pass them along.
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:42.820]   And EDTD handles a wide range of file types, including documents, scripts, installers,
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:43.820]   executable files.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:49.860]   It identifies and isolates anything that looks at all suspicious, then runs it in a safe,
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:53.420]   this is so brilliant, safe sandbox environment.
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:54.980]   So they can do code analysis.
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:56.780]   They can inspect the sample.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:58.020]   They use machine learning.
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.540]   They use in-memory analysis.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.940]   They use AI.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:01.940]   They can adapt.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:11.380]   So EDTD analyzes all the behaviors and can allow or block a file almost instantly in minutes.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:14.940]   This speed does not slow you down because it's all happening in the cloud.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:17.660]   Doesn't put an extra demands on your system resources.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:23.340]   And it's something endpoint detection alone just can't accomplish.
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:24.340]   You do not want to be.
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:28.100]   I do not want to be patient zero in a cyber attack.
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.860]   But how do you defend against a threat no one's ever seen?
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:33.100]   ESET Dynamic Threat Defense.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.980]   That's how world class ransomware protection.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:37.780]   It's part of ESET's protect complete.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.020]   The bundle does include endpoint security.
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:43.700]   We got a lot of laptops out there in the field because many of our people are still working
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:44.900]   from home.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:45.900]   Full disk encryption.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.660]   I love that.
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.540]   Laptop gets lost.
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:50.900]   Everything's protected.
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:56.460]   And advanced security for Microsoft 365, which closes those gaps in the native protection
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:57.500]   too.
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.340]   Right now you can get 20% off ESET protect complete.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.140]   You can try it before you buy.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:05.740]   ESET, I've talked about them for years.
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:08.820]   Get your free ESET business trial and an interactive demo.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:11.860]   This is the only antivirus I recommend in use.
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:14.540]   Business.eset.com/twits.
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:17.260]   Save 20% on ESET protect complete.
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:20.980]   And for businesses really is not optional.
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:24.500]   I just got to say it's not optional.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.500]   Limited time offer though.
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.500]   So don't wait.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.500]   Go to business.eset.com/twits.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.820]   I do not ever want to come in the door.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:36.980]   And here, oh, we got hit.
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:39.300]   That is a black day.
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:43.300]   We don't have to worry about it because we've got ESET business.eset.com/twits.
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.300]   Thank you.
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:45.800]   Thank you, ESET.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:53.060]   While Christina adjusts her blinds, let's take a look back at the week that was on Twitch.
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:57.500]   I got the Bloomberg ice cream from Microsoft.
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:58.500]   Oh, you did.
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:03.660]   It embodies the fluid design of the US and the iconic Windows 11 Blue.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.940]   Ooh, that doesn't look like Windows 11 at all.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:10.180]   It's like a bird-beating out of the cat's ditch.
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:13.780]   Previously on Twitch, Tech News Weekly.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:15.380]   It's time to talk about Windows 11.
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:16.380]   It is here.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:22.340]   I think the big game changer is the ability to easily run Android apps from right within
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:23.340]   Windows.
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:25.700]   The problem is, of course, that feature isn't there.
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:30.340]   Instead, it's easier to snap Windows into place in different structures.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:31.340]   Windows Weekly.
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:34.220]   The first impressions of the Surface Pro 8.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.220]   It's a beautiful machine.
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:39.540]   The whole of those things together, the Surface Pro 8, the Surface Pro signature keyboard,
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:45.580]   the Surface Slim Pen II, is exactly what people who love Surface Pro have been calling
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.540]   for for years, and it's going to make people very, very happy.
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:49.740]   This week in Google.
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:50.740]   This is bad.
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:58.180]   The user posted a 125 gigabyte torrent link on 4chan that basically contains everything
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.180]   on Twitch.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:00.660]   I was sorry, Twitch.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:02.500]   No, you don't get our source code.
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.740]   No way, man.
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:04.740]   The tech guy.
[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:05.740]   Oh, what else, man?
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:07.740]   I'm going to do you by only home.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:08.740]   Oh, no.
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:09.740]   What's the matter, Naomi?
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:13.540]   I have the ring doorbell, and it starts almost every week.
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:14.540]   It's too cold.
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:15.540]   You have to...
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:16.540]   What?
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.940]   Micah, by the way, says he'd be glad to knit you a sweater for your doorbell.
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:24.180]   Yeah, of course, she's a little dog with a red nose.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.180]   You're so cute.
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.180]   That would be really adorable.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:29.780]   If you missed Twit this week, you missed a lot.
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:35.220]   Yeah, really fun having Micah sit in the tech guy with me.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:37.020]   We're going to do more of that.
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:40.700]   Did you got the Bloomberg ice cream, didn't you, Daniel?
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.700]   I did.
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.700]   Did you eat it yet?
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.180]   Came in a big box with dry ice.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.180]   No, I haven't actually.
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:46.180]   Why not?
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:47.180]   I keep forgetting.
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.180]   I know.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:49.180]   It's just...
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.700]   I'll try it tonight.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:53.620]   I have never forgotten to eat ice cream.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.220]   It looks a little weird.
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:42:04.740]   Didn't they say something like the swirls or to look like the windows wallpaper or something?
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.700]   I don't know about that.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:11.500]   It did come from a famous company in New York City that's very known for us.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.740]   Yeah, Micah likes it.
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:15.380]   It's supposed to be a very good ice cream and all that.
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:16.380]   It's cute.
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:21.660]   They sent it in a box with dry ice, which was kind of hilarious.
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:24.060]   Yeah, it's fun with the ice.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:25.060]   We know who Micah is.
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.060]   We know who Micah is.
[01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:27.060]   We know who Micah...
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:28.060]   Yeah, that's what I would do.
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:29.060]   Just never eat it.
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:32.060]   Pretend it's like your wedding cake and just keep it in there for 10 years and then sell
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:33.620]   it.
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.900]   You really knew who Micah saw it like from who got it.
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:37.060]   Paul did not.
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.780]   Mary Jo did.
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:39.780]   You got it.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.700]   I just deen got it.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:41.700]   I did not.
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:42.700]   Did you get some?
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:45.580]   Did the Micah saw employees get any of this ice cream?
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:46.580]   No.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:47.580]   No.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:48.580]   No.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:53.100]   I mean, it sucks because I would probably be considered an influencer by someone's metrics,
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.300]   but I'm an employee, so no, absolutely not.
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.300]   That's a good point.
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:00.060]   You're just as much of an influencer as I just deen.
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:01.780]   You should have got some.
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:02.780]   I think so.
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:03.780]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:04.780]   It's fine.
[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:07.620]   Are you getting...
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:11.180]   More importantly, are you getting a Surface Laptop Studio?
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.660]   I'm thinking about it.
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:14.940]   My issue is I love the idea.
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:16.220]   I love the concept.
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:17.220]   Here's my thing.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.460]   I'm waiting for the new MacBooks announcement.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:20.460]   I know.
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.460]   I know.
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:24.460]   If I can get 32 gigs on like...
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:26.940]   How many laptops does one person need?
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:27.940]   I know.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:28.940]   Well, this is the thing.
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:34.380]   I just got this framework which I'm in love with and it's like a great day and use thing.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:35.780]   I will say this.
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:37.460]   I am due for like a corporate refresh.
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:39.580]   I'm like way, way, way over view.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.780]   Does Microsoft give you your choice?
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.780]   Yeah, but...
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:48.140]   Well, you can have a choice of...
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:50.740]   There's a number of different things you can choose from.
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.460]   My hope would be that...
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:58.180]   I'm like exceedingly overdue, but because of ship shortages and other stuff, they've
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:00.500]   still kind of put some about off.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:07.140]   My hope is that if I don't get one personally, that I will be able to cross my fingers and
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:12.500]   bat my eyes and get it as part of my corporate refresh.
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.380]   By the way, Mikey likes it.
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:17.900]   Ice cream in New York tweeted...
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:22.620]   The blueberry ice cream with blueberry pie filling pound cake and candy chocolate pieces
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:27.300]   is free today at our East Village and Harlem locations while supplies last.
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:28.620]   That was an October 5th.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:30.780]   So shoot.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:32.940]   We could have flown in New York.
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:33.940]   Yep.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:34.940]   Darn it.
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.780]   I'll sell you mine.
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:37.780]   Damn.
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:38.780]   I like...
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:40.580]   Can I turn to an NFT?
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.580]   Oh man.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:44.260]   Oh, Mikey likes it NFT.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:50.100]   Honestly, blueberry ice cream with blueberry pie filling pound cake and candy chocolate
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:53.820]   pieces does not sound that tasty.
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:55.340]   It's a lot.
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.340]   That's a lot to put ice cream.
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:57.340]   It is a lot.
[01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:01.180]   It sounds very sugary, but I'm guessing it's good.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:02.740]   Hey, Mikey likes it.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:03.740]   I want it.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.740]   I've got no idea.
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:10.700]   So this is, of all the new surfaces, I guess the duo is pretty innovative.
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:12.020]   This is the most innovative.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:17.020]   This is to replace the Surface Book, the Surface Studio laptop with...
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:21.020]   No, I used a studio for a long time and they're not going to update that ever, but it has
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:25.500]   that kind of tilting screen on a laptop instead of the weird hinge.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.580]   It also has a base.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:31.180]   You can see it in this picture from Windows Central, which is for the fan because it's
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:33.340]   supposed to be very high-end.
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:34.500]   Paul was a little disappointed.
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:35.900]   He said it's not as high-end.
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.900]   It's not as fast as one would hope.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:38.900]   Do you read Daniel?
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.340]   You seem to like it.
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:44.260]   It really depends what you want to do with it.
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:45.260]   It's a very fast laptop.
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:48.260]   I'm actually using it right now to power all this.
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:50.780]   It's running through a Thunderbolt 4 dock.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.460]   It's controlling my 3-0 camera.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:46:00.060]   It's controlling my HyperX microphone, running a second monitor, a 27-inch monitor.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:06.660]   The background blur you see is due to Nvidia Broadcast, which uses AI and the RTX graphics
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:07.660]   parts.
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:12.100]   It's a much better blur than the software blurs you see in Skype and Zoom and other things.
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.580]   It really looks pretty good.
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:14.780]   It looks real.
[01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:15.780]   That's good.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:17.780]   You need the power of Nvidia RTX.
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.980]   By the way, those are gauges.
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:19.980]   Those are gages.
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:21.980]   Those are surface earbuds.
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:24.620]   You didn't get your ears pierced.
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:28.020]   You're comfortable for a long podcast.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:30.020]   They sound good.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   Yeah.
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.180]   It's fast.
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:37.220]   It's got a great graphics card, but it depends what you want to do with it.
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:42.180]   If your thing is that you just want to game on it, it's an OK gaming machine, but you'd
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:46.780]   be really dumb to buy this as a gaming laptop when there's so much better other options
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:47.780]   out there.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:53.460]   The reason you buy this is because you want to use those other postures to stage mode
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:56.220]   where you get that cool triangle effect.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:01.780]   It's really nice for being on a conference call, watching a movie, taking notes.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:05.300]   You can pull that screen all the way down.
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:08.260]   You can pull it down to cover the keyboard, but you can pull it all the way down.
[01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:09.860]   It's still at a slight angle.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:10.860]   Studio mode.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:11.860]   Studio mode.
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:15.460]   It's kind of like the Surface Studio where you would use a pen and draw on it.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:19.860]   Somebody was saying, though, it's not rock solid in that mode, that it's a little bouncy.
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:21.180]   It's an experience.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:26.300]   I had no issues with it, but there's obviously a little bit of a, you know, does have hinging
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:27.300]   going on.
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.300]   Right.
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:32.220]   But yeah, if you don't plan to use it for those things, this isn't a good purchase.
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:36.700]   But I think for people who rely on the pen, do a lot of video editing and stuff like that,
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:38.140]   it's totally fine.
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:42.780]   It's not, the thing with Surface, there's always going to be something more powerful.
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.620]   There's always going to be something more affordable.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:46.740]   There's always going to be more ports.
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:51.380]   It's always going to be the case, but you should be buying this for what it can do with
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:54.300]   those different postures in the pen.
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:48:01.420]   And the whole package, you know, there's, Acer makes the concept D7, was it a concept
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:05.020]   D easel, which is, has the same pull it forward design.
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:07.940]   Well, no, for the X-one too, I think, right?
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:08.940]   There are a couple of companies.
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:09.940]   No, HP does.
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.780]   HP, the Elite Folio.
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:12.780]   Okay, Elite Folio.
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:13.780]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:18.060]   So this design's been done before, but if you go with the Acer, you're going to get a
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:24.260]   much more powerful processor and it's going to be cheaper too, but it's the audio is terrible.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.180]   You don't get a haptic pen.
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:29.460]   You're going to get a 16 by nine display.
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:30.620]   It's plastic.
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:35.100]   You know, those aren't the old killers for a lot of people, but for some people, they
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.580]   are, right?
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:40.140]   There's a lot of benefit to what Markzoff has done in this design, including a haptic
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:42.540]   trackpad for the first time.
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:46.300]   So you know, this is for specific demographics.
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:49.980]   120 Hertz display to, I think, some just one her display.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:50.980]   I really want that.
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:51.980]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:52.980]   Yeah.
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:54.980]   So there's a lot of first here.
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:55.820]   The audio is very good on it.
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:01.020]   It's got a very nice front facing camera, which is still a problem for even, you know,
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:05.220]   HP now is starting to get on board with five megapixel cameras and high end.
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:07.100]   It used to be the struggles in this area.
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:10.900]   I'm hoping Apple puts a decent camera on the new laptops.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:11.900]   Right.
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.900]   So this is like a complete package.
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:15.180]   It's very fast though.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:20.300]   Like I think people get a little too fixated on benchmarks and it really depends what you're
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:21.300]   doing.
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:23.340]   If you're doing productivity work with this, it's fast enough.
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:27.220]   You can get this at 32 gigs of RAM, two terabyte SSD in there.
[01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:34.500]   You can get the 3050 Ti graphics or the A2000, which is for ISV and engineering with, you
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.140]   know, CAD software.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.140]   It's very fast.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:41.460]   Like there's no moment you're going to feel like this is slow, but it also depends, like
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.140]   I said, what you want to do with it.
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:47.180]   So have they put in a six or eight core processor?
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:48.180]   It would have been faster.
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.740]   It would have also driven up the price.
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:53.460]   It would have shortened the battery life, it would have made the device hotter and it
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.900]   would have made the fans louder.
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:58.140]   So you have to figure out how all this stuff balances out.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:01.100]   And I feel like it did a nice job here in terms of balancing it.
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:04.260]   But you know, I put a lot of benchmarks on there.
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:06.420]   It's a fast machine.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.420]   Are there faster machines?
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:08.420]   Of course there are.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:09.580]   So it really depends what you look at.
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:12.180]   It's top five in PC Mark 10.
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:13.180]   So that's pretty good.
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.180]   Yeah.
[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:15.940]   I mean, it's in terms of productivity.
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:22.620]   In terms of productivity, it matches a Razer Blade 15 from earlier this year, which is
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:25.660]   full on gaming laptop with an eight core CPU.
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:29.100]   So like it's, that was a 10 gen process.
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:30.100]   This is 11th gen.
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:34.980]   So it goes to show you just how much a four core 11th gen is improved over a 10th gen
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:36.780]   six or eight core.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:41.180]   One of the things that PC users have always had Mac envy for the track pads, you say this
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:45.740]   is the best track pad on any PC available.
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:48.420]   So I have a story coming out on this probably next week.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.420]   The company I've interviewed.
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:53.740]   So this is the company that makes the technology behind this is called sense.
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:58.780]   They're actually kind of a startup out of a, I believe San Francisco actually San Diego,
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.980]   maybe there are in California.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:04.900]   So their technologies, what's actually doing the haptics, Microsoft designed the trackpad
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:06.900]   itself, but they worked with sense.
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:13.060]   So here, and this is actually it's more power efficient than Apple's trackpad because haptics
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:14.860]   do require power, right?
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:21.780]   So the operate, it also has a slider and settings so you can control the haptics, how much kick
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:22.780]   do you want it?
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.900]   Yeah, we can even turn it off if you just don't want it at all.
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:30.620]   And it's, you know, it's, they're not the first to central also to the trackpad, the
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:36.700]   haptic trackpad on the titanium X one by Lenovo, but you're going to hear a lot more of sensual
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:42.660]   track pads being in computers coming out through 2022 and a lot more designs.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:45.180]   But yeah, haptic track pads are a big deal.
[01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:50.580]   They solve a lot of problems, including breaking more consistent clicking.
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:56.180]   And basically they can be a thinner design, which then allows for larger batteries or
[01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:59.380]   thinner laptops.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:02.460]   I battery life looks pretty good.
[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:09.300]   I mean, it sounds like it's not the best in any one category, but it's a very nice combination
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:10.300]   of capability.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:14.940]   And it does a lot of something like I said, it can't be done in another laptop.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:17.540]   Whether you need that is a separate question.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:22.660]   If you just want a really nice laptop and you don't need the pen, you don't need like
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:26.860]   the stage mode, whatever, then there are better options out there.
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:33.460]   The audio on this, the 120 hertz display, the front facing camera, the power of the battery
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:34.460]   life.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.460]   Have you sold you, Christina?
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:39.300]   Yeah, I mean, I'm like I said, like I just bought a laptop.
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:44.820]   I can't buy like I can't spend $6,000 on laptops in one year.
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:47.060]   It's hard to justify, but I want one.
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:51.980]   Like I said, I'm really hoping that because I have a Surface book as my work issue laptop
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:52.980]   now.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:56.980]   And so I'm hoping that I also have a MacBook Pro, but that's very old.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:53:00.820]   So I'm hoping that that my I will be able to get one, you know.
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:07.140]   And briefly, because Daniel also reviewed the Surface Pro 8, finally Thunderbolt connector
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:08.340]   is huge.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:12.220]   I wouldn't buy a Surface until they did that at least.
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:14.100]   So why won't buy an AMD laptop to be honest?
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:16.300]   I won't get an AMD laptop because it doesn't have Thunderbolt.
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:23.780]   I have a lot of like I have a specific AMD motherboard on my game PC that supports Thunderbolt.
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:26.820]   And it was difficult to find one.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:28.380]   That's like a Surface Pro 8.
[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:31.460]   Surface Pros are one of those things that are polarizing.
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:38.300]   You're either in either love them or you go, why would anyone get convertible with a bouncy
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:39.300]   keyboard?
[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:41.140]   I mean, just for me, it's not for me.
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:44.700]   But I know people who just say, God, I love my Surface and I'll get every one of them.
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:50.060]   Do you say in your review, Daniel, this kind of is the kind of the pinnacle of this.
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:53.100]   It should be, but they finally kind of licked a lot of the problems with this.
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:54.100]   Yeah, right.
[01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:56.260]   I mean, the latest Surface is always the best Surface, right?
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:01.300]   But this one is different because they redesigned it to match the Surface Pro X, which was when
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:05.700]   the first major modern designs they've done with the Surface Pro series.
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:10.700]   But what makes this one good is the fact that they just gave people what they've been asking
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.700]   for.
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:13.820]   So now you got two Thunderbolt 4 ports.
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:15.900]   I connected it up to an eGPU.
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:18.380]   In fact, I have it on my desk here.
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:23.580]   So I was running my Surface Pro 8 with an RTX 3080 on my desktop.
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:27.940]   And then I use the other port going to a Thunderbolt 4 dock and connected all my stuff
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:28.940]   there.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:31.020]   And I was using that as my desktop setup as well.
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:33.100]   And it worked flawlessly.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:36.660]   And that's the power of having Intel and Thunderbolt.
[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:39.060]   And when people go, why don't they use AMD?
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:40.700]   It's like, well, that's why.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.700]   That's why.
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:42.700]   I was going to point it out.
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:43.700]   Yep.
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:47.020]   You know, AMD and Thunderbolt don't mix and laptops.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:51.300]   And that's going to be a problem for premium multi-books and AMD, but that's a separate
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:52.300]   topic.
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:57.420]   But yeah, I mean, 120 hertz display on that one, haptic pen, you still got to you.
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:02.180]   The industry leading still the best front-facing 5-megapixel camera.
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:06.820]   That is the best mobile web camera period on any device right now.
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:09.620]   You have a 10-megapixel rear camera, which is nice.
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:11.580]   You know, they updated the audio.
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:13.260]   So now it's two-watt speakers.
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:15.180]   And it's a very good audio.
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:18.820]   Like, you know, Apple does very good audio and it's iPads.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:21.140]   This is like, it's getting there.
[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:25.500]   It's when plus has Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision for the display.
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:28.460]   It's just the entire package that kind of came together.
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:30.340]   The 11-gen processor is good.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.780]   And the new design is nice too.
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:33.180]   And then there's just small things.
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:34.180]   Yeah, it's black.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:36.820]   There's a black option, right?
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:40.700]   Black laptops are notorious for picking up fingerprints and just looking really gross.
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:44.660]   Have to about five minutes of using them, which is why I'm not usually a huge fan.
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:48.820]   They figured it out away so that this thing basically hides fingerprints.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:52.900]   It's just on these little small details they put into it that I think they're going to
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:55.180]   keep this design probably not for another couple of years.
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:57.300]   And I think that'd be fine, actually.
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:03.260]   Dan, you just wrote about the iPad Air, speaking of iPads, is everything that's wrong with
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:04.260]   Apple's tablets.
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:06.940]   This is the article in Macworld.
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:08.580]   It's not anything wrong with the Air.
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:10.940]   It's the schedule that's the issue, right?
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:15.500]   It's an issue that they've had with having all these disparate parts of the tablet lineup
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.540]   rolled out into the top of the mini.
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:18.540]   I feel like the mini.
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:19.540]   The mini is so good.
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:20.540]   What an amazing product.
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:23.380]   I mean, that is Type C speaking of finally having the right port.
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:24.380]   Got rid of lightning.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:25.940]   Type C.
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:27.500]   It's just the right size.
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:33.380]   I think what Apple should be doing from now on, which is a fingerprint reader, on Offswitch.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:34.620]   I just love the mini.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.340]   Oh, I love that size.
[01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:37.340]   It's shoot, shoot, shoot.
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:39.860]   And it works with a really good product.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:41.100]   Works with a pencil too.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.820]   And it's pink.
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:44.500]   And it's, well, your speech yourself.
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:45.500]   Well, mine is pink.
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:46.500]   Mine is pink.
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:48.140]   I'm just saying they gave me a pink one.
[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:49.300]   I was very excited about that.
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:50.300]   So thank you.
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:51.460]   No, the mini is perfect.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:52.460]   Yeah.
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:55.020]   I think the mini is too small to do.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.620]   It's not a creator device.
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:58.380]   It's a consumption device.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:01.060]   But it's not even a primary iPad.
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.060]   Let's be clear.
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:03.700]   The mini is really like your secondary iPad.
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:04.940]   It's your second iPad pro.
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:05.940]   Okay.
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:08.980]   That'll give you some idea of how bad we are.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:13.380]   I have the 12.9 inch iPad pro when I need a big one with an M1 chip in it.
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:14.380]   That's what I use.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:19.500]   And when I'm lying in bed with on my side and I'm just reading Reddit, iPad mini is perfect.
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:23.700]   You remember how on Star Trek Next Generation Captain Picard always had the stack of tablets
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:24.700]   on his desk?
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:27.100]   Now, you know, he had like four different tests.
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:29.100]   Yeah.
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:31.940]   And until we get like the expandable screens, you know, that we can roll out or whatever
[01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:36.860]   to make bigger until that's actual reality and not, you know, weird Samsung or LG demo,
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:37.860]   then this is what we have.
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:40.020]   We have to have six different sized devices.
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:41.020]   Multi iPad lifeline.
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:42.020]   Do you think so?
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:45.660]   At some point, Apple will kind of get this schedule, get all the iPads released at the
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:49.500]   same time instead of this weird.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:53.100]   It's tough to tell what is a result this year, obviously extremely weird, right?
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:54.860]   In terms of things rolling out.
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:57.060]   So it's no surprise this stuff's not perfectly in sync.
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:58:01.020]   I think in a perfect world, it's not like they released an iPhone in September and then
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:05.660]   like six months later, usually like, oh, more iPhones that are also new, right?
[01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:08.820]   I mean, yes, you have the SE that comes out every couple of years or so, but it's not
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:10.900]   like it's revved every year at the same time.
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:14.940]   I think in an ideal world, all the iPad lineup stuff would come out roughly around the same
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:15.940]   time.
[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:19.660]   I don't know that there's a huge advantage for them targeting the spring, which they often
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:22.700]   seem to do with some of these as opposed to targeting the fall.
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:24.220]   The fall leads in the holiday season.
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:25.580]   It's traditionally Apple's biggest quarter.
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:28.580]   You'd think they want all their sort of ducks in a row at that point, but it's also very
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:29.580]   full.
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:33.540]   There's a ton of other products that get released in the fall as we're talking about right now.
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:38.340]   So I can understand sort of wanting to do a midstream, but it does continually put these
[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:43.620]   sort of products in weird situations where, for example, the mini is now much better than
[01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:44.620]   the air.
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:45.820]   It's cheaper.
[01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:48.980]   And so if you don't care about screen size, then there's a lot of advantage to pick up
[01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:53.180]   the mini for a while last year when they rev the air, it was better than the iPad Pro,
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:54.860]   which is far more expensive.
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:58:59.580]   And the air hits a weird price point too, where it's like for a 64 gigabyte model, you're
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:01.020]   paying kind of a premium.
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:04.980]   And if you want to go up to a higher storage tier, you're basically like 50 bucks shy of
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:05.980]   an iPad Pro.
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:09.420]   And the question is, well, shouldn't you just spend the extra 50 bucks and get one that's
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:11.340]   got more power to it?
[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:14.660]   So I think they need to sort of figure out what is our lineup?
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:15.980]   Where does the air fit in our lineup?
[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:19.180]   Because everything else feels very clearly demarcated.
[01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:22.900]   You've got that ninth generation iPad that starts at 330, which is like the, if you
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:26.060]   need like the bargain basement, but very capable iPad, great.
[01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:29.500]   If you want something that's like high end, the top of the lineup, the iPad Pro suits you
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:30.500]   really well.
[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:33.980]   And if you're looking for something small, then it's got to be the mini, but the air
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:35.220]   is kind of all over the place.
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:39.620]   So I like to see them do a rev on it, and I'm sure they'll come around next spring, but
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:43.140]   they got to sort of figure out what is this product and who is it for?
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:47.660]   We're not in the Apple will do three events this fall, then camp.
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:48.660]   I think it unlikely.
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.900]   I mean, we're all expecting a second one.
[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:53.540]   I am not really expecting anything beyond that.
[01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:57.380]   I think that anything past that gets sort of in press release, you know, now.
[01:59:57.380 --> 02:00:00.260]   Christina clearly expecting an Apple laptop event.
[02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:01.260]   This, this October.
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:02.660]   I mean, I think so.
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:04.860]   I mean, I, I, I hope so.
[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:07.420]   Like if they don't, that'll, that'll suck.
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:12.020]   But, but I mean, because the difficult thing is, is, is the chip shortage issue, right?
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:13.020]   Like I think that.
[02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:14.020]   It's going to hit everybody.
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:18.580]   In fact, Microsoft even said, uh, you know, we're not going to have a plentiful supply
[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:21.340]   of the new Xboxes until next year.
[02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:22.340]   This is going to go on.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:26.180]   No, no, 20, 23, they said it's going to be a long time.
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:27.180]   It's going to go on.
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:29.180]   Have you been trying to get one?
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.940]   Oh, I have an Xbox.
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:31.940]   I know you have one.
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:32.940]   I know you have one.
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:33.940]   I know you have one.
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:34.940]   Of course you have one, Christina.
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:35.940]   I can help you get one, Dan.
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:36.940]   If you need help getting.
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:39.620]   So I asked Brianna, why I said, where'd you get that Xbox?
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:41.900]   She said, Christina, of course.
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:44.740]   I know you're going to have a Playstation 5.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:45.740]   I'm sorry.
[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:46.740]   I've got a Playstation 5.
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:48.500]   I think I did actually help her get an Xbox as well.
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:50.100]   I also got her the video card.
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:51.820]   What is your?
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:54.380]   What is, what is, yeah, what is this secret?
[02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:55.660]   How do you do this?
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:59.140]   It's just, just dedication to the hunt.
[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:02.580]   Is it the same skills you're using getting sneakers?
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:03.580]   Yes.
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:09.700]   So you've developed this, this voodoo skill in the pursuit of sneakers and now you can
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:11.340]   apply it to other consumer goods.
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:13.860]   That's actually 100% is the exact same thing.
[02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:15.260]   It's just, it's become more difficult.
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:17.340]   You speak easier for something.
[02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:18.500]   Now everybody's learned the trick.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.020]   So you compete with more people.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.220]   The trick is to know Christina.
[02:01:22.220 --> 02:01:23.220]   Apparently.
[02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:25.060]   That's the trick.
[02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:28.700]   Just like a relentless dedication.
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.900]   Like almost like the focus.
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:34.060]   Like I think I've told the story before, but on my birthday last year I was able to get
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:37.500]   three PS5s in one day.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:40.340]   And you know, I had them shipped directly to other people.
[02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:42.020]   Like I wasn't taking any profit on anything.
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:44.780]   I was just like one of those things I was like, I'm going, I was like told Simone, I
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.620]   was like, I'm going to get you a PS5.
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:48.460]   And I found one for my friend Kelly.
[02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:50.140]   And I found, you know, got one for somebody else.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:54.180]   And I was like, I'm just, I just woke up at like seven o'clock in the morning.
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:56.020]   I was like, I've taken the day off because it's my birthday.
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:58.420]   And I'm like, I got magic to do.
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:01:59.420]   Yes, I do.
[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:00.420]   Exactly.
[02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:01.420]   That's exactly it.
[02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:05.180]   I was like, I'm choosing violence and my method of violence is to score as many consoles
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:06.580]   as I can for the day.
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:07.580]   Yeah.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:13.100]   And then I apparently lacking that something we just, everyone said, well, go to Walmart.
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:15.100]   You have to have things to do.
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:16.100]   That's what I was going to say.
[02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:17.100]   Oh, no, you're busy.
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:18.100]   You don't have to.
[02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:19.100]   You don't have to.
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:20.100]   You're busy.
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:21.100]   You're busy.
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:22.260]   You're not, you're not sitting back on your laurels there.
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:27.460]   You know, but I thought I'd be like, make it up like I focus like to do it now.
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:28.660]   And that's the thing.
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:31.700]   Like, like if I'm just like, am I so lucky that I can just like pass away?
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:32.700]   Oh, I want this.
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:36.140]   No, I was like, no, I'm going to like dedicate like a ton of time.
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:37.140]   That's too much time.
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:39.220]   So you just go to all the different sites?
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:40.980]   Is that what you do or no, you must have.
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:44.620]   Yeah, well, I have notifications set up for various discords and other things, but everybody
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:45.620]   does that.
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:46.620]   Discords, that's true.
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:47.620]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:48.620]   Yeah.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:49.940]   I mean, you know, I mean, there are Twitter accounts too.
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:51.940]   The problem is now everybody knows all the places to go.
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:53.180]   So you're all fighting people.
[02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:54.180]   I did.
[02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:55.340]   There are people who do bots.
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:56.340]   I don't do bots.
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:57.580]   I've thought about doing bots.
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:03:02.380]   I don't do bots because you never know if they're going to pay off or not.
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:06.340]   There's some sneaker bots and supreme bots that are very expensive, but apparently.
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:08.180]   Oh, you have to buy the bots?
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:09.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:10.180]   Nothing.
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:11.180]   Nothing is free anymore.
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:12.180]   Oh, man.
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:17.020]   JBC three in our chat room says it's not she doesn't just want it.
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.020]   She needs it.
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:19.020]   Right.
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:21.300]   So I'm saying like, and for me, like there's a certain thrill.
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:23.020]   Like, and people have even noted this.
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:25.460]   So like, you just really get off on like the hunt.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:27.420]   Like you just really get off and like finding it.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:28.820]   And I'm like, you're exactly right.
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:31.660]   Like, it's, it's one of those things where it's like someone's telling me, Oh, no, you
[02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:32.660]   can't get this.
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:33.660]   This is impossible to get.
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:35.980]   I'm like, Oh, now I feel challenged.
[02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:38.300]   So that's the real reason.
[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:39.300]   It's a challenge.
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:40.300]   Yeah.
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:41.540]   Oh, 100%.
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:49.580]   So Apple, it's funny when Apple, when the court ruled on the Apple Epic trial, Apple
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:53.260]   was saying we won and Epic was saying we lost.
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:54.260]   And I thought, well, wait a minute.
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:58.500]   Not so fast because Apple, aren't you going to have to now open your app store?
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.620]   Apple must have known.
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:01.620]   That ain't going to happen.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:08.180]   They have now filed an appeal if they, they're asking for a stay on the injunction that says,
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:13.780]   developers can add those buttons to non Apple payment sites in their apps.
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:19.780]   If Apple wins, according to CNBC, and this will be decided by a judge next month, the
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:25.060]   change in policies may not take effect until appeals have finished in years.
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:28.660]   They may not have to make a change in years.
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:31.260]   So Apple really did win that Apple Epic process.
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:32.260]   Yeah.
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:34.300]   I mean, they won nine out of 10 counts on it.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:37.500]   As my pal John Gruber said, they figured, why not go for 10?
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:38.660]   10 out of 10, baby.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:39.660]   Perfect score.
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:40.660]   Why not?
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:41.660]   Why not?
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:42.660]   It costs them nothing.
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:45.780]   It costs them nothing other than legal fees, and they have more money than anybody in the
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:46.780]   world.
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:50.060]   So do you think there's a shot that they'll get the injunction?
[02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:54.060]   I think there's a possibility they'll get at least a stay on it as far as the appeal
[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:55.060]   goes.
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:56.860]   And these are all.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:57.860]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:57.860 --> 02:04:59.940]   Look, we're appealing this, your honor.
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:00.940]   So can we just not?
[02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:03.020]   Because we don't want to do it until we hear the appeal.
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:04.020]   Right.
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.020]   Exactly.
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:06.020]   And that's fair.
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:07.020]   And then that's that.
[02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:08.020]   It's not a small move for them to make you that, necessarily.
[02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:09.020]   It's not just flipping a switch.
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:13.300]   They just have to demonstrate how hard this would be, how much work would be.
[02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:17.300]   And if the appellate court overturns it, see, we wasted all of our time.
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:18.300]   Yeah, I bet you right.
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.300]   I bet they get it.
[02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:21.740]   And you can just, they can wait out the clock here, right?
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:25.700]   And if it turns out that they end up eventually losing two years down the road, they've had
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:29.340]   two years to exactly figure out what's going to happen and how they're going to play this
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:33.180]   off or to change their model in some way that doesn't require this or evade it in some
[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:34.180]   other way.
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:37.440]   I mean, any company is going to play this game in terms of trying to figure out how
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:39.900]   to come up with the most advantageous result for themselves.
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:41.540]   And there are no exception to it.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:42.540]   No fools.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:47.460]   All right, let's take a one last break and then we'll wrap things up with a great panel
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:48.460]   this week.
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:49.460]   So smart.
[02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:50.460]   You're so good.
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:55.020]   Daniel, Rabino, Dan Morin, of course, Christina, I can get it for you wholesale,
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:56.020]   Lauren.
[02:05:56.020 --> 02:05:59.540]   It's great to have all three of you on the show.
[02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:02.460]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:05.940]   This is October Cyber Security Month.
[02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:09.060]   And man is cyber security important when you're talking about IT.
[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:10.060]   It's all we talk about.
[02:06:10.060 --> 02:06:13.340]   It seems like on our shows, it's one of the most vital aspects.
[02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:20.140]   If you're looking to get into IT or if you're already doing IT and you want to get into cybersecurity,
[02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:21.580]   now is the time.
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:28.180]   The world needs, there are millions of jobs literally waiting for you with qualified individuals
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:33.020]   who have the certs in cyber security and there's no better place to get the skills you need,
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:35.700]   the search you need than ITProTV.
[02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:37.980]   Start your IT career today with ITProTV.

[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:46.940]   networking, cybersecurity.
[02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:50.180]   One of the things I love about ITProTV is their stuff is up to date.
[02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:55.460]   This stuff changes all the time, new versions of the software, new certs.
[02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:57.660]   The tests, questions change.
[02:06:57.660 --> 02:07:00.580]   Microsoft just dropped the MCSE certification.
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:03.580]   There's a whole new set of Microsoft certs.
[02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:08.180]   And of course, ITProTV keeps up because they've got, this is kind of overreach, but they've
[02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:13.060]   got seven studios running all day, Monday through Friday.
[02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:15.660]   So they're constantly updating new material.
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:18.180]   You can watch them do it live just as you watch us do it live.
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:19.180]   There's a chat room.
[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:25.140]   And then the new material makes it into the library within 24 hours, 5,800 hours of IT
[02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:26.780]   training on demand.
[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:29.940]   And you can watch it any way you want on your computer, on your phone.
[02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:31.860]   They've got apps for all the streaming clients.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:35.860]   I mean, those hardware really is fantastic.
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:40.580]   It's a spooky month for ITProTV this month in October.
[02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:44.060]   Jam packed with events focused on cybersecurity.
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:48.380]   They had an event which I think is now online, but they've got more to come.
[02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:49.940]   You didn't miss it.
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:54.940]   They've got a webinar at the end of the month, a Halloween themed webinar titled, I guess
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:56.020]   everybody being costumes.
[02:07:56.020 --> 02:08:00.100]   I don't know, CyberSec incident response for small businesses.
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:03.780]   It's subtitled avoiding the nightmare on Main Street.
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:07.980]   You can find out more about that at itpro.tv/webinars.
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:12.660]   There's going to be a panel discussion this week, 5pm eastern on the 14th.
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:15.980]   Dirty, if you're interested in a career, you should absolutely watch this.
[02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:18.700]   30 little secrets of a cybersecurity career.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.380]   It'll feature three cybersecurity experts.
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:25.900]   Don Pazette is moderating one of the founders of ITProTV, the host of their Technado podcast.
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:26.900]   He's great.
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:28.100]   That's on the YouTube channel.
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.460]   There's more information there on the ITProTV YouTube channel.
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:38.580]   And then on the 23rd and 24th, there's a free weekend at ITProTV, a chance to try a bunch
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:41.420]   of different courses free as a special.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:46.460]   Just for the theme, the following courses will be part of the ITProTV free membership.
[02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:51.300]   Your CompTIA security plus cert, ITProTV is an official partner of CompTIA.
[02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.940]   So they're the official video partner.
[02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:55.740]   So they have great ITProTV stuff.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:09:01.100]   The CEH cert, which is one I've always wanted, the Certified Ethical Hacker cert, the CompTIA
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:06.460]   CYSA plus CISA plus cert, CISSP.
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:08.020]   Nobody does a better job of teaching you.
[02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:11.940]   Their edutainers, that's what they call them, are experts in the field, but they're not
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:12.940]   just experts.
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:16.540]   They're fun, they're engaging, and they're passionate about IT.
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:20.580]   And that passion makes it great content.
[02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:24.980]   Courses are 20 to 30 minutes long in each section so you can easily watch it during lunch break.
[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:28.540]   They know you got a job day job and you're trying to get a better job.
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:32.340]   This is something you can consume in your part time.
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:36.340]   The edutainers are all on staff, which is great because that means you can get assistance
[02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:38.980]   from them during the day.
[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:40.780]   I just think it's a great solution.
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:45.420]   The IT world definitely needs more cybersecurity professionals than ever before.
[02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:49.860]   Get your cybersecurity certs with ITProTV.
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:50.860]   Now here's how you do it.
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:55.700]   You go to itpro.tv/twit.
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:10:01.420]   There is an offer code, 30% off any consumer subscription, and it's 30% off as long as
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:03.820]   you stay active, forever if you stay active.
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:05.780]   That's Twit30, the offer code.
[02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:08.060]   Make sure you know that and use it.
[02:10:08.060 --> 02:10:09.060]   That's a big savings.
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:11.740]   30% off the lifetime of your active subscription.
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:15.580]   ITProTV/twit offer code, Twit30.
[02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:22.140]   ITProTV, of course they also have great classes for businesses, for teams.
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:26.060]   You should check that out as well, but that's for the consumer subscriptions.
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:30.700]   ITProTV, build or expand your IT career and enjoy the journey.
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:35.100]   Great friends of the network we've been with them since they started.
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:41.060]   Of course now they're just going great guns.
[02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:51.540]   On Monday somebody put 125 gigabyte torrent link for Chant4chan for everything.
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:56.620]   Twitch.tv/head, Twitch.tv's source code, projects they hadn't launched.
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:00.620]   They talked about like vapor but hadn't launched.
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:02.500]   Passwords, streamer keys.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:05.860]   Of course as soon as I learned about this I'm going to immediately change my password,
[02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:07.340]   turn on two factor.
[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:10.620]   They will force you to change your streamer key if you're a streamer.
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:18.540]   But the thing that actually is really interesting is they also released how much money the top
[02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:20.540]   streamers make.
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:27.140]   Well actually how much everybody makes but the lists have come out of the top streamers.
[02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:34.420]   Number one, critical role which I'm gratified to know is a D&D stream.
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:36.540]   It's not League of Legends or something.
[02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:37.540]   It's tabletop.
[02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:40.020]   Apparently they put a lot of effort into it.
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:43.980]   I haven't seen it but costumes and sets and so forth.
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:49.380]   They made between, and this is just for Twitch, not anything else that they did not sponsorships
[02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:51.060]   or product placement or anything.
[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:58.180]   They made between July 2019 and August 2021 more than $9 million.
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:02.780]   Nice work if you can get it.
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:07.900]   Now it's my opinion.
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:10.620]   Some people like Vise is saying this is terrible.
[02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:11.620]   This is for streamers.
[02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:15.140]   Oh no, this is awful.
[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:17.340]   My opinion, this is actually good for streamers.
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:20.860]   It's really good for Twitch because there are going to be a lot of people say you can
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:24.180]   make $10 million on Twitch.
[02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:27.380]   Count me in.
[02:12:27.380 --> 02:12:32.380]   Do you think that people are pissed off that streamers make so much money?
[02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:36.220]   People are always pissed off that people don't make it.
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:37.220]   Yeah.
[02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:38.220]   People who don't make that much money.
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:41.700]   I saw who doesn't watch streaming in game.
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:43.540]   I mean I checked it out once in a while.
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:48.460]   I watched a chest one which was actually run by like two girls in the early 20s which
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:49.460]   I thought was fast.
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:50.540]   The teenies in a hot tub.
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:51.540]   I know.
[02:12:51.540 --> 02:12:52.540]   I've watched it.
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:53.540]   It's fabulous.
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:54.540]   Oh okay.
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:55.540]   It was not that one.
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:56.540]   Very awesome.
[02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:57.540]   Okay.
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:12:58.540]   It was very cool stuff.
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:03.180]   But I get mad when people get mad at these people for making money.
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:05.180]   No, it's hard.
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:06.180]   It's hard.
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.740]   Like if it was easy go and do it.
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:10.940]   But it turns out you need talent.
[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:12.300]   You need to be likable.
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:14.860]   You need to be able to entertain people.
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:16.220]   And guess what?
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:18.220]   Most people can't do that.
[02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:20.340]   So I have no problem whatsoever.
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:23.380]   What people make money out there for what the market is giving.
[02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:27.300]   80 streamers have earned over a million dollars in the last two years.
[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:28.700]   Believe for them.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:29.700]   What's wrong with that?
[02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:30.700]   Exactly.
[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:31.700]   Yeah.
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:32.700]   I will say a slight degree.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:36.220]   I mean like we run our own D&D stream over at the incomparable work.
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:37.220]   I get jealous.
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:38.220]   I get jealous.
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:39.220]   A little bit.
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:40.460]   It's a fraction of that.
[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:43.980]   You didn't make $9.6 million in the last two years.
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:48.700]   I may be made $9.6 in the last year.
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:50.780]   Just your D&D in it wrong.
[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:51.780]   That's all.
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:52.780]   Apparently.
[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:58.180]   Actually speaking of chess I was very gratified to see that Hikaru, a couple of big chess
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:01.700]   masters made hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:04.660]   You know grandmasters are notoriously thread bearer a lot.
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:06.500]   They've never made any money.
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:10.860]   Tournament fees used to be thousand bucks.
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:13.420]   It's a good job now to be a grandmaster.
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:17.060]   Thanks to streaming on Twitch and other services.
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:19.060]   You can make some money.
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:20.060]   You can.
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.060]   But as Daniel points out like it's a job right?
[02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:23.060]   This isn't one of those things.
[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:24.060]   Oh God is it a job.
[02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:25.060]   People are.
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:27.940]   You know this better than anybody.
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:31.180]   The most disarming thing and the people who are usually very successful are the ones
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:33.220]   who hide how hard of a job it is.
[02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:38.060]   So you are kind of taken in by the fact that oh anybody could do this.
[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:39.060]   But there's planning.
[02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:40.060]   There's scheduling.
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:41.060]   There's scripting.
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:42.060]   There's editing.
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:46.180]   You know like making sure that you know in this case the D&D one sounds like they have
[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:47.180]   costumes and like.
[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:49.180]   Oh yeah they put a lot.
[02:14:49.180 --> 02:14:53.940]   Like like so so so okay so it was nine point two million dollars over two years.
[02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:54.940]   That's amazing.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:55.940]   I'm not taking anything away from that.
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:59.580]   But if you were to look at what their hard costs are in terms of talents and in terms
[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:03.780]   of other things that starts to eat into that right to say nothing at the time.
[02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:07.900]   Well Twitch takes by the way apparently half of it.
[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:08.900]   Right.
[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.180]   So that they only get half of that.
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:13.220]   But then there's you know there's the product placement and so race.
[02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:15.220]   No you have you have massive opportunities.
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:16.220]   I'm not taking anything away from it.
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:18.100]   I'm just trying to point out like this is a job.
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:20.780]   This isn't like people are just sitting back and doing nothing.
[02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:25.940]   Like some of the biggest YouTube channels are basically run like small television networks.
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:26.940]   Right.
[02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:31.820]   Like you know in terms of the amount of money and time and stuff that goes into it.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:36.780]   And when you think about that like even the most low end like cable you know like let's
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:38.700]   say a news program like like cable news program.
[02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:43.620]   You're talking about something where you have a budget in the you know like you know at
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:45.660]   least low level millions right.
[02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:50.060]   So just to spend on equipment and other stuff obviously the budget on a YouTube thing can
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:53.420]   be left that but you know people as they get bigger they need office space.
[02:15:53.420 --> 02:15:54.420]   They need accountants.
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:55.420]   They need editors.
[02:15:55.420 --> 02:15:56.580]   Again they need lighting.
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:58.660]   They have to take time for script managers.
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:00.140]   This is a real managers.
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:01.860]   Yeah this is a real gig.
[02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:06.500]   And I think the hard thing too is that this is like this is why we've heard so much about
[02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:11.340]   creator burnout over the last few years is that to keep it going you have to continue
[02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:12.340]   creating content.
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:17.340]   You can't take a break like at least in traditional you know forms of media you have either the
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:21.060]   typical television season or you have breaks hiatus.
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:23.580]   Yeah you have guest hosts that can come in and do stuff.
[02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:25.180]   You have support staff.
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:30.340]   In these cases like the person is the brand and they can't take the break.
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:32.620]   So you know they're putting all this into it.
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:38.100]   So I think on the one hand like I'm like it's wonderful that people are making all this
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:39.100]   money.
[02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:42.460]   On the other hand I feel like what hasn't always doesn't always get the attention when
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:45.740]   people see these big figures and they think oh I can I can get rich this way it'll be
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:52.300]   easy is a how much effort to involve and be how difficult it is to keep up on that grind.
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:57.260]   Because if you don't keep doing it there's no guarantee that you know if you take a few
[02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:00.300]   weeks or a few months off that the audience will be there when you get back.
[02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:01.300]   Yeah.
[02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:02.300]   I don't know.
[02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:04.420]   I can't imagine most people are surprised.
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:08.260]   I mean we know Marquez Brownlee makes millions.
[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:12.900]   Most people should not be surprised that there's money in this and I don't think most of
[02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:13.900]   your audience.
[02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:15.300]   Yeah I don't think most people would grudge it.
[02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:18.300]   Nobody ever said oh Johnny Carson earns way too much money.
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:19.300]   Jimmy Fallon's way.
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:20.300]   No you don't.
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:21.300]   No.
[02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:22.300]   We know you stand this.
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:27.420]   And in fact actually that's a great point like when you look at how much money Jimmy Fallon
[02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:32.100]   makes a year and if you look at how much work he puts into it versus some of the bigger
[02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:35.820]   streamers and bigger YouTubers like it's not even a comparison.
[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:40.300]   And actually when you look at audience size they're more similar than you might think.
[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:46.060]   But one has institutional investment and backing and massive massive advertisers and you know
[02:17:46.060 --> 02:17:48.860]   one is just coming up but I mean this is a real business.
[02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:53.220]   This is a real opportunity if anything I think it's like you should we should be happy that
[02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:54.820]   people are figuring these ways out.
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:18:00.940]   But to Daniel's point everyone thinks that they can do this you can't it's it's it's a
[02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:04.300]   lot of luck is involved but also it's just not something every every single person can
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:09.940]   do and even if you have a skill like if you're a grand master that may or may not translate
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:14.340]   well online and you may or may not want to take the time away from your gameplay and
[02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:17.180]   your other things to deal with all the stuff that goes into a stream.
[02:18:17.180 --> 02:18:20.540]   So you know I I I I I I don't we're doing it.
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:22.380]   I I know most people don't go graduate.
[02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:26.220]   It's the same story time Memorial is anything to do with media right I mean or I mean we
[02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:29.660]   heard a lot about this in the in the app Gold Rush as well where everyone's like oh I make
[02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:35.540]   an app I'll get rich it's like no it's hard right but anything books movies TV shows the
[02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:39.900]   money has always been there but a very small percentage of people can actually pull off
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:41.780]   the work needed to do that.
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:46.700]   Sub-stack you know is the new thing yeah exactly it's always to be and we always we always
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:49.580]   hear the stories of the people who make the most money what you don't see is that the
[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:51.380]   vast majority of streamers I'm sure.
[02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:52.380]   No absolutely nothing.
[02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:53.380]   I look at him.
[02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:55.380]   No not that they have no views.
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:19:01.500]   He'll take all day to I mean it is hard work and if you don't post one day you go oh crap
[02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:06.020]   I'm losing I'm losing I got to get out there it's it is really crazy.
[02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:08.660]   Wait I tell you guys what basketball players are getting.
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:13.500]   I know apparently you can make millions by bouncing balls.
[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:14.500]   Amazing.
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:19.580]   I know it's a crazy world but this video streaming is completely new and different.
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:21.580]   Yeah that's part of it.
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:24.260]   Let's hear about the burnout stuff is bad.
[02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:25.660]   That is a serious issue.
[02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:29.340]   But let's also face is social media as we talked about at the beginning of show is designed
[02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:34.500]   to express outrage so the people who are outraged are getting a disproportionate voice.
[02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:37.980]   The vast majority of people are going well speaking of outrage there's a lot of outrage
[02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:40.980]   among Twitch streamers and other gamers.
[02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:45.100]   e-sports players about the new coke campaign have you seen the ad?
[02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:46.100]   I'm going to play it for you.
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:51.580]   I hope the coke doesn't mind me playing their multi-billion dollar ad for free.
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:54.380]   For free coke I'm just pointing that out.
[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:58.300]   Apparently it's going to lead up to some big announcement but watch this this is actually
[02:19:58.300 --> 02:20:00.220]   kind of an interesting ad.
[02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:05.500]   It's about e-sports so they're all playing what is not world of Warcraft except it looks
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:07.780]   exactly like World of Warcraft.
[02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:14.060]   Some sort of battle royale you got your young young lady playing a bunch of other guys.
[02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:19.100]   She's got an orc that's just really dominant killing people right and left the crowds loving
[02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:20.900]   it then wait a minute.
[02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:22.100]   He gets knocked out.
[02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:23.100]   Oh no.
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:24.100]   He's down.
[02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:25.100]   Is she down?
[02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:26.100]   Is she out?
[02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:30.860]   She reaches over to her little mini fridge right next to her gaming station takes out a Coca-Cola
[02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:33.540]   drinks it and look what happens to the orc.
[02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:35.220]   It gets diabetes.
[02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:36.220]   Yeah right.
[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:38.180]   He knows he knows he's drinking coke.
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:43.580]   Yes apparently somehow knows she's drinking coke and changes his tune.
[02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:45.300]   This is wait a minute.
[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:49.980]   Why are we fighting this war?
[02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:51.900]   Why are we so angry?
[02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:53.940]   And he goes over.
[02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:58.220]   He throws his axe into the ground.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:00.020]   Says the hell with that.
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:04.020]   Goes over helps his opponent up.
[02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:05.580]   Wars over man.
[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:07.420]   Wars over.
[02:21:07.420 --> 02:21:08.420]   The gamers are waiting.
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:12.700]   Wait what the what what's going on?
[02:21:12.700 --> 02:21:14.620]   What's a new world?
[02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:17.460]   Peace has broken out.
[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:21.060]   They're taking off their helmets.
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:26.620]   Gamers all over the world are throwing down their mice.
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:29.820]   All because of Coca-Cola.
[02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:32.820]   It's a world.
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:33.820]   It's a world.
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:34.820]   It's a world news.
[02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:39.020]   I mean this is the long one by the way you won't see this on the Super Bowl but something
[02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:41.900]   like a little bit of what was the Pepsi ad from a couple of years ago.
[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:42.900]   For kittles.
[02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:45.020]   I was going to say this is better than the Pepsi ad.
[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:48.100]   They can they can feel better about that is less tone deaf than the Pepsi ad but only
[02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:49.100]   barely.
[02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.100]   Oh what's your name is handing a pepsid?
[02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:52.900]   We're kittles in our hands.
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:53.900]   Hands on the top.
[02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:57.540]   Yeah during a very just protest for peace.
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:03.100]   The motto of this is we are one coke away from one another.
[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:11.860]   And so yeah no admittedly it's sugar water designed to cause diabetes but that aside
[02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:13.980]   I mean it's a nice message.
[02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:16.220]   Gamers are pretty upset that there have been memes.
[02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:18.740]   I think they're getting the benefit of it.
[02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:23.180]   Oh yeah I mean they they've I mean it's a bad ad but if they're getting the memes from
[02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:26.740]   it then honestly coke is getting all their money's worth.
[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:30.580]   The Pepsi ad was tone deaf and terrible and they had to remove it.
[02:22:30.580 --> 02:22:32.980]   Kendall Jenner ad was so awful.
[02:22:32.980 --> 02:22:33.980]   I agree.
[02:22:33.980 --> 02:22:35.220]   That was genuinely bad.
[02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:39.660]   Like this is funny like this I'm like okay this is ridiculous in saccharin but if people
[02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:41.620]   are going to meme it then I kind of like it.
[02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:42.620]   Like the coke is like.
[02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:44.620]   And here's the other thing you should take away from.
[02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:45.620]   That was going to happen.
[02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:50.940]   Esports is now big enough that you can be a multi-billion dollar company buy and add on
[02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:54.700]   NFL football about esports and people get it.
[02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:55.700]   Yep yep.
[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.700]   They finally made it.
[02:22:57.700 --> 02:22:59.860]   It feels like I'm loited by companies.
[02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:00.860]   Modern corporations.
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:01.860]   Welcome.
[02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:05.100]   Feels like a modern version of the I'd like to buy the world a coke.
[02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:06.660]   I was thinking the exact same thing.
[02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:09.100]   I was like that's exactly what it is.
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:11.700]   I'm actually kind of sad they didn't tie that into the messaging.
[02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:13.900]   Like they should have like played.
[02:23:13.900 --> 02:23:18.060]   They should have played some of the tones of that just for like the few people you know
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:21.260]   in the target audience who would get that because it and that would at least be more
[02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:25.460]   tongue in cheek like we're aware of the ridiculousness here but like if they played a couple of
[02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:29.180]   the you know like like piano tunes of you know I'd like to buy the world a coke.
[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:33.140]   I mean like that theme song I mean it came out.
[02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:37.740]   Coke is often done all the soda companies have often done feel good ads.
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:38.740]   Always.
[02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:40.660]   That make you go aww.
[02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:41.980]   By the way what do you think.
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:44.180]   The Christmas, the Christmas that adds with the snow bears.
[02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:45.180]   The polar bears.
[02:23:45.180 --> 02:23:46.180]   Yeah yeah yeah.
[02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:47.180]   Aww.
[02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:52.460]   What do you think are her is her fingernail art on fleek Christina Warren or take a look
[02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:53.460]   at this here.
[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:56.580]   What do you think the little dots on there is that what all the sports gamers are going
[02:23:56.580 --> 02:23:58.260]   to be doing now.
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:23:59.260]   I mean I think it looks good.
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:00.260]   I actually like it.
[02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:01.260]   The gamers are going to do it but I like it.
[02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:02.260]   I think it's a good size.
[02:24:02.260 --> 02:24:04.460]   I'm not that at it.
[02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:10.140]   So Coke is getting they say ratioed because there are 12,000 thumbs down and only 1,000
[02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:14.980]   thumbs up but again that's a great way to get attention on YouTube.
[02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:16.780]   Speaking of getting that PR.
[02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:18.380]   Hello fellow kids meme.
[02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:21.820]   Hello fellow kids.
[02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:22.820]   Let's play a game.
[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:27.580]   Although I bet that the marketing and executive ad person who came up with that was probably
[02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:30.580]   closer to like being like a Gen Z age wise.
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:33.100]   I bet they had to fight to get that on the air.
[02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:34.100]   I'm sure they did.
[02:24:34.100 --> 02:24:36.980]   But I'm just saying like for that to be as detailed as it is and whatnot.
[02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:42.540]   I was like okay you had somebody who was younger who helped craft that message.
[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:45.940]   I would love to know the story behind the campaign and that regard.
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:52.700]   Now I mean like I said the Pepsi ad is a legitimately bad ad and funny for that reason.
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:57.900]   This if people meme it what they are doing unbeknownst to themselves getting so mad about
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:03.540]   the advertisement is they are literally just giving Coke the eyeballs and repeating the
[02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:06.300]   message over and over again which is all Coca-Cola once.
[02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:10.980]   Coca-Cola is the number one you know soft drink in the world by a massive margin because
[02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:12.540]   everybody knows Coca-Cola.
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:13.540]   Like that's that's the joke.
[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:17.580]   You can show anybody the logo in any language and people are like oh yes I know exactly what
[02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:18.580]   that is.
[02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:23.460]   So speaking of getting ratioed the most famous YouTube video getting ratioed was of course
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:25.620]   the yearly rewind.
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:30.580]   Which is now officially dead.
[02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:34.420]   They have youtubers said we are not going to do this ever again.
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:40.060]   They canceled the last year extensively due to COVID they said no you know what it's not
[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:42.780]   coming up not coming back.
[02:25:42.780 --> 02:25:45.060]   Rewind is gone.
[02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:49.340]   You know what else is gone this show it went by fast though thank you so much you three

[02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:35.220]   That sounds about right.
[02:27:35.220 --> 02:27:37.660]   Yeah it takes a lot of my day.
[02:27:37.660 --> 02:27:38.820]   Tell us about him.
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:39.820]   Sure.
[02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:44.300]   My co-host tech podcast called the rebound every week with a couple of my fellow Apple
[02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:48.860]   aficionados like Friedman and John Moltz we started taking a reverent look at the weeks
[02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:50.420]   news off an Apple and other stuff.
[02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:54.220]   I love Moltz does he admit now to being the.
[02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:56.220]   I won't say anything about this.
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:27:58.220]   Okay he wanted to.
[02:27:58.220 --> 02:27:59.620]   Okay we all know what I'm talking about.
[02:27:59.620 --> 02:28:01.620]   I can either confirm or deny.
[02:28:01.620 --> 02:28:02.620]   Yes okay.
[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:07.620]   And I of course say over at relay a family co-host clockwise with your pal Mike a sergeant my
[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:09.980]   pal Mike a sergeant every week which we do.
[02:28:09.980 --> 02:28:11.180]   But you had me on once.
[02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:12.180]   So much fun.
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:13.180]   Which have you back.
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:15.940]   I'm not used to doing short shows.
[02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:17.260]   It's a short show I know.
[02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:18.940]   This is a little bit of a trick.
[02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:20.420]   So it's a good show.
[02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:21.420]   It's tough for me.
[02:28:21.420 --> 02:28:22.420]   Yeah yeah.
[02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:23.420]   It's great to see you.
[02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:24.420]   Do a bunch of that.
[02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:25.420]   Thanks.
[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:27.220]   Yeah anything else did I get them all.
[02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:32.340]   Oh those are my main shows but also want to always pump my books I'm a sci-fi novel.
[02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:33.340]   Oh I forgot.
[02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:34.340]   Let the novels.
[02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:35.340]   Yes.
[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:36.340]   Yeah.
[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:41.540]   So I got two three out right now most recently the Alif extraction which is on sale and the
[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:46.420]   next one is coming next July the Nova incident pre-orders going up pretty soon.
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:51.700]   Has Apple Plus approached you yet for a serializing the Alif extraction.
[02:28:51.700 --> 02:28:56.260]   The galactors cross will see how see how foundation does I think that'll be a good.
[02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:57.260]   What do you think?
[02:28:57.260 --> 02:28:58.580]   Good intro.
[02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:00.060]   I like what I've seen.
[02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:01.820]   And I'm enjoying it.
[02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:06.380]   You got to remember that Isaac Asimov was never about people or characters.
[02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:07.380]   It was always about big ideas.
[02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:09.380]   Books are very dry.
[02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:12.900]   Like they have cool ideas but I think it was never going to make a TV show just one to
[02:29:12.900 --> 02:29:16.700]   one so I'm glad that they spent some time investing in character and all that stuff.
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:18.180]   They had to and people are going to play.
[02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:19.180]   Oh it's not like the novel.
[02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:20.180]   It couldn't be like the novel.
[02:29:20.180 --> 02:29:21.180]   You don't want to see the novel.
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:24.540]   And by the way still suffers from that kind of a little bit dry.
[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:27.820]   A little bit like I don't care about anybody yet but we'll see.
[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:28.820]   I'm watching it.
[02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:29.820]   I can't stop.
[02:29:29.820 --> 02:29:30.820]   It's so beautiful.
[02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:31.820]   I can't stop watching that.
[02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:32.820]   It's gorgeous.
[02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:33.820]   Yeah.
[02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:34.820]   Yeah.

[02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:45.540]   Are you excited about the new Animal Crossing?
[02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:47.380]   Are you back to playing it or no?
[02:29:47.380 --> 02:29:52.300]   Well I've taken a break but I think there's an event that's in a couple of days so I'm
[02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:54.940]   going to I'm hoping to kind of get sucked back in.
[02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:56.740]   I'm not getting the new Switch.
[02:29:56.740 --> 02:29:58.500]   You didn't get the OLED Switch?
[02:29:58.500 --> 02:29:59.500]   No.
[02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:01.500]   But it's going to someone else.
[02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:02.500]   Of course.
[02:30:02.500 --> 02:30:07.620]   Well no well they needed it and they who do you go to when you need a console?
[02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:08.620]   We know.
[02:30:08.620 --> 02:30:09.620]   To me.
[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:13.220]   And I've ordered it but Walmart is back ordered so they'll get it next week.
[02:30:13.220 --> 02:30:16.620]   I probably will wind up buying it but Christina needs it.
[02:30:16.620 --> 02:30:17.620]   Christina needs it.
[02:30:17.620 --> 02:30:19.660]   I have like she needs it.
[02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:21.220]   But I have like four switches.
[02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:22.220]   Oh.
[02:30:22.220 --> 02:30:23.220]   So it's stupid from.
[02:30:23.220 --> 02:30:24.220]   Okay.
[02:30:24.220 --> 02:30:25.220]   I don't need it.
[02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:26.220]   That's true.
[02:30:26.220 --> 02:30:27.220]   Then you're right.
[02:30:27.220 --> 02:30:28.220]   Honestly right.
[02:30:28.220 --> 02:30:29.220]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.

[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:43.220]   I'm not going to be a fan of it.
[02:32:43.220 --> 02:32:45.220]   I think this would be a great feature.
[02:32:45.220 --> 02:32:48.220]   Christina Warren, Snaker of the Week.
[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:49.220]   Thank you very much.
[02:32:49.220 --> 02:32:50.220]   I like that.
[02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:54.220]   I will credit you if I take that into a show.
[02:32:54.220 --> 02:32:55.220]   I like that.
[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:56.220]   I should do a show without it.
[02:32:56.220 --> 02:33:06.220]   Or do it on your show with Simonda Rush 4 and Brianna Wu, the fabulous Rocket Show.
[02:33:06.220 --> 02:33:08.220]   You can have the Rocket, Snaker of the Week.
[02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:09.220]   I like that.
[02:33:09.220 --> 02:33:10.220]   I like that.
[02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:11.220]   Thank you.
[02:33:11.220 --> 02:33:13.220]   I think you should do it and you can have it.
[02:33:13.220 --> 02:33:14.220]   I give it to you for free.
[02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:15.220]   Thank you, Leo.
[02:33:15.220 --> 02:33:16.220]   Appreciate it.
[02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:17.220]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:33:17.220 --> 02:33:18.220]   Great to have all three of you.
[02:33:18.220 --> 02:33:19.220]   Thank you all for watching.
[02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:21.220]   Twit is a show that we record.
[02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:23.220]   I think I don't know.
[02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:30.220]   You tell me if I'm wrong, but I think the longest-running, continuously-running tech podcast in the world.
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:33.220]   We started April 20, 2005.
[02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:38.220]   We are in our 16th plus year of operation.
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:40.220]   I think that's pretty good.
[02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:42.220]   I think we've kept up our standards.
[02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:44.220]   Maybe even got a little better over time.
[02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:46.220]   Certainly the quality's gotten better.
[02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:49.220]   We do the show every Sunday evening.
[02:33:49.220 --> 02:33:55.220]   It's about 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:59.220]   If you want to watch us do it live, you can hear the conversations before and after.
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:03.220]   For instance, we talked a lot about the framework laptop before the show.
[02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:05.220]   Tune in a little bit early.
[02:34:05.220 --> 02:34:07.220]   The live streams are at twit.tv/live.
[02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:09.220]   There's live audio and video.
[02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:14.220]   People who watch live or listen live often like to chat live with us at our IRC.
[02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:17.220]   That's IRC.twit.tv.
[02:34:17.220 --> 02:34:25.220]   If you're a member of ClubTwit, which is our paid tier, $7 a month to support us, that's the real reason to do it.
[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:26.220]   We appreciate it.
[02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:28.220]   But you also get access to our Discord.
[02:34:28.220 --> 02:34:31.220]   That is a fabulous place to hang out and chat all the time.
[02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:38.220]   You get free versions of all of our shows, not free $7 a month, but they're ad-free versions of all of our shows,
[02:34:38.220 --> 02:34:40.220]   ad-free and tracker-free.
[02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:43.220]   You get access to the Twit Plus feed really hot on the Twit Plus feed right now.
[02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:48.220]   Steve Gibson did not ask me anything on Friday and people are eating it up.
[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:50.220]   It's very, very popular.
[02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:55.220]   Even if you missed it on Friday, you can join the club now and download it.
[02:34:55.220 --> 02:34:59.220]   That's a twit.tv/clubtwit, thanks in advance.
[02:34:59.220 --> 02:35:04.220]   On-demand versions of the show available there, but also available on our website, twit.tv.
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:09.220]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated to every show has its own YouTube channel.
[02:35:09.220 --> 02:35:12.220]   You can go there and watch the videos.
[02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:16.220]   Best thing to do, probably be subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:18.220]   If you subscribe, you'll get it automatically.
[02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:24.220]   The minute it's done of a Sunday evening, get it before everybody else does just in time for your Monday morning commute.
[02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:29.220]   And if your podcast player supports reviews, would you do us a favor?
[02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:33.220]   There's one downside to being the longest running tech podcast in the world.
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:39.220]   People forget about us or never heard about us and we don't make it on the charts because we're not brand new.
[02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:41.220]   So leave us a five-star review.
[02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:46.220]   Kind of spread the word help the world know about this week in tech.
[02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:48.220]   Thank you everybody for being here. We'll see you next time.
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:51.220]   Another Twit is in the camp.
[02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:52.220]   Bye-bye.
[02:35:52.220 --> 02:35:53.220]   [Music]
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:36:03.220]   [Music]
