[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   I thought we'd go back and talk to some of the pioneers of the technology industry.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   We sometimes would call it our gray-haired Twit.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   Starting with this fellow here.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   I don't know what's going on with your camera, Jerry.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   It looks like you are coming to us from the Isle of Man space program.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   Jerry Pournell.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   Of course, a great columnist for Bite Magazine.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   We hope to see you in the new Bite.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   I've been talking to Gina Smith, the new editor in chief of Bite Magazine.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   She really wants chaos manner back.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   I hope we can get that.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   It's good to have you, Jerry.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   Hi.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   Yeah, it looks like Bite may be coming back.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Gina is really a ball of fire.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   She is.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   She's the greatest.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   She's also a doll.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   Well, more than that, we're hoping to do their podcast.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   We want to call it Bite Cast and have the Bite Editor's Roundtable on our network as soon as we get a roundtable.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   We're going to buy a roundtable just for it.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   Oh, terrific.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   But it's going to have to be done remotely.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   I'm not coming up to pedal.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   I haven't got much interest in arm wrestling.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   I'd like to come see you sometime, but that's a long trip.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   I'll explain.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   You can do it from right there in your library.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   By the way, Jerry, if you're watching the video is in his library and his home in Southern California.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   It's always a great shot to see all those books.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   I just love it.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   It's like a museum.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   The Dead Tree Edition.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   It speaks to the way it is.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   But I like Dead Trees because you can see their titles.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   Well, Jock's Barzen once described it as a scholar in his office being assaulted by his books.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   I love it.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   And that's just what it looks like.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   That's great.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   Well, and we also know that you'll be able to read them even decades from now.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Whereas with all of this electronic format stuff, we don't really have any guarantees that they'll be readable at some arbitrary point in the future.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   As a matter of fact, I could use some advice on how to read some old five and a quarter inch magneto optical this old worm drive.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   I have nothing that will read them anymore.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   Yeah, that voice, that other voice you hear is somebody you probably will recognize as the host of our Security Now podcast and my dear old friend Steve Gibson, who has also been doing podcasts with us since the very beginning and another writer.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   Did you have a right for Biden?
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   I know you were an info world.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Oh, just info world.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   And Steve's column.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   What was it called?
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   Tech Talk.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Tech Talk column.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   For many years, I read an info world magazine and sitting right next to him in the back page of info world magazine. That's this guy, John C. Devorak.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   Inside track.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   Inside track.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   He still does the inside track.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   It's PC mag still publishes it, right?
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   Well, I mean, it's online.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   Everything's online.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   Everything's going online.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   So, yeah.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   Yeah, that online thing.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   It's just a flash.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   I've heard about it.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   Everybody's probably forgotten, but I had the back page column in bite after, I mean, an info world after Devorak left it turned out that McGraw Hill had not properly drawn up its contract to make it exclusive against info world so they would.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   That's interesting.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   I think that was the best spot in the magazine was the inside back, but it's the facing to the actual, but you open the magazine from behind and it's what you look at. That's what John had for.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   You know, the reason that was considered prime real estate is because it was only for the writers because what it amounted to was that people who go to a newsstand flip open the back page read your stuff real quick and put the thing back.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   Skip the rest.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   It's easy to skip the body of the magazine.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   I don't know how prom that was.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   My job is to ask.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   Oh, no.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   I think it's true.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   I was on the other side of this guys.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   I was the guy who subscribed to info world in bite magazine and absolutely flipped right to the back page of info world every single week.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   Steve, with all due respect, it was inside track right away.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   Oh, I know.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   And my column was the next page in.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   And you know that advertisers are charged extra premium for the inside front and inside back covers.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   So it must be that it gets extra attention and you know, it's understood.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   Front of book back of book all of that.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   Yeah, all right.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   My job, Neil bite was carrying the back of the book.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   They put me in on page 240 is where my column started and they'd have it one column wide and about half a page deep and it wound through everything page in the back of the book.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   The whole way to the end, every end and people would say, why don't they put you up front in the feature position and I had to point out to them that I got paid more for being back in the back because I carried all those pages of ads for God's sake.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   That was why they were so dang long and rambled.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   That's when computer magazines had 236 pages in them still.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   There's robot catalog size.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   If anybody remembers what a series of robots.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   I don't think that's a reference that's going to resonate either.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   Go ahead.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   80%, 85% were ads.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.400]   I mean, they were just made the amount of revenue of those things generated.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   You know, it was the beginning of the end when you got the computer shopper and it must have been 10 pounds and you could make furniture out of this.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   If you had a year's worth of computer shopper, you had a nightstand ready made.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.400]   And build a house.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   No kidding.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   John, what were you going to say before I got started?
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   I'm going to say that probably the best example of that sort of thinking that Jerry was expressing is the cartoons in the back of the New Yorker.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   They're only there to keep you flipping through those pages so those ads can get some attention.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   No, you're right.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   Hey, just a word.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   This is the last episode of the fifth year of the Twit Network.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   Our very first Twit was April 17, 2005.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   We begin our sixth year next Sunday and we're going to bring back as best we can the hosts on episode one, Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Robert Heron.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   I think John, David Prager will join us.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   John, you weren't a part of Twit until maybe five or six episodes in.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   I think of episode five.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   So I'm out.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   Well, you can come if you want.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   You'll be the new guy.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.400]   Yeah, I would be a third wheel.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   Leo, it'd be really neat if it were possible to do sort of a time capsule that way and talk about how the Internet has changed in these five years because those guys were all part of it.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   Well, the big story this week is the House of Representatives on Friday overturning the FCC's Internet regulations.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   Their net neutrality regulations.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   Senate will have to vote on this.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   President Obama's already said that he will veto the bill should the Senate pass it.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   Senate is expected to pass it.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   And of course, this is always that big fight is should the government be involved in net neutrality.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   And if so, what is Obama right to veto this?
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   Let me start with you, Jerry.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   I know you have a pretty strong anti-government bias.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   It's not so much anti-government is that I think I'm not one of those people an anarchist.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   I'm not one of those people who thinks they ought not be a government.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   I just think it ought to mind its own business and I don't think this is the government's business.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   I haven't seen any abuses.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   John was telling me that we were going to have 200 ballot accounts because of this, but I haven't seen it happen yet.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   Does it scare you, John, that the net neutrality regulations are overturned?
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   No, but I do agree with Jerry that I don't like the idea of the FCC all of a sudden.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   My thinking is the following.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   Once the government starts getting involved with net neutrality, then they're going to get involved with regulation.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   Because it's like they can't back off.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   They just get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   I work for the government.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   I've seen this in action.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   Well, we talked about this before, but let me throw in the opposing point of view and then let you tell me why I'm wrong.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   I think this, I agree with you.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   The last thing I want to see is the government involved in the internet, but I think this is a mess government created.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   In fact, the FCC created when they allowed the duopoly of the cable companies and the phone companies to control the internet.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   If there were true internet competitiveness, if I could go to 10 different ISPs, I wouldn't be so worried about net neutrality,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   but Comcast says 250 gigabyte cap, AT&T just announced 150 gigabyte cap.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   That's a form of network discrimination.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   Isn't this the FCC fixing the problem that they created in the first place?
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   Don't we need this because we don't have true competition?
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   This is that situation where you create a problem and you fix it and mess something else up and then fix that and fix the next thing that you screw up and then you keep tracing it back.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   And the next thing you know, and I'm telling you, this is what's going to be word headed, you're going to have to be licensed to do this show.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   If that happens, I'm going to the Isle of Man.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   Leo, you still have about 10 terabytes of live broadcast every hour.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   And so maybe you need more than 150 gigabytes.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   If people know very many people who need that kind of bandwidth.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   Well, that's the argument AT&T gives that, oh, 99% of our customers don't use that much.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   This is to prevent bandwidth.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   But I disagree, Jerry.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   I think what they're doing is a preemptive strike against the day soon to come when we're watching Netflix,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   when we're downloading movies from iTunes and Amazon.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   This is to protect their phone businesses, to protect you, their television business.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   They're worried about me and everybody else taking over.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   Well, and remember, they're also protecting the MPAA and the RIAA.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   We're now seeing the government blasting web domains and arbitrarily deciding that, okay, these guys are copyright infringers.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   And suddenly, we can't access those domains because they're taken out of DNS.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   I mean, the government is definitely creeping into our internet.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   I do.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   I do think that is.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   But I don't think letting the FCC have at it with the, I mean, you know, Pranels, iron law bureaucracy says that
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   bureaucracies exist to fortify themselves and expand their own capabilities not to do what you think you set them up to do.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   But that's all right.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   But that's dog, Marjorie.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   What do we do if you don't have the government?
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   My observation.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   Okay, but what do you do about this particular problem?
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.400]   How do you solve this?
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   You know, we've got this situation where really the cable companies and the phone companies have an iron grip on our internet access.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   And if they choose to, as they seem to be, acting in their own business interests, not in the interests of the nation and the people of the nation, then what do we do?
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   How do we prevent that?
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   Set up another set of channels.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   You do, you compete with them, of course.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   Well, who?
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   Who's going to do that?
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.400]   You know, the century tells got their own system out there.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   Verizon's got one sprint net, has got the, you know, that wireless thing going on.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.400]   The Y Max, you can, you can subscribe to in many parts of the country.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   It's not a complete monopoly.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   No, no, it's a duopoly or...
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   No, that's a triopoly in some places.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   But it's beside the point, these other guys couldn't compete.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   They're all colluding with each other.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   They are, don't you, don't you believe in technology?
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   I do.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   I wish I, but the problem is there's already a mess made.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   You know, in the dial up era, you had many choices, but as soon as it became...
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   How does it hurt by the situation so far?
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   Because you're probably the one guy who could be.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   What's that around here?
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   This is, it's so far no problem.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.800]   However, I do fear when I see these bandwidth caps put on, there are, I'll tell you, I've
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.000]   been hurt outside the U.S. and countries like Canada and Australia, where they have much
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.480]   lower bandwidth caps, people, many of our viewers in Australia, can't watch the video
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.080]   because it would use up their bandwidth cap.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.080]   And I fear that that time is rapidly coming to the United States.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.040]   And it's, and it's, by the way, it's not an interest to protecting their constrained
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.120]   resources because, and John and I, you've had this fight many times with me over the
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.720]   cost of bits.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   I don't think it's that.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.320]   I think it's to protect their entrenched businesses, their, their cable premium cable channels.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.960]   Well, that could be Leo, but let's take another look at this.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.360]   What has the government done about all these antitrust deals?
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.240]   Every time an opportunity comes for them to say no to something like this AT&T upcoming
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   buyout.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.880]   People say no, they just, they encourage it.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.600]   So what is the government going to do if you put the FCC in charge?
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.040]   They're going to encourage more of this.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.560]   And then who's going to get the thing is there, I don't see that they're doing but
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.760]   anybody any good now.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.880]   The net neutrality is already hearing and it's all boiling down to the point where you're
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.480]   going to have to buy a license to do the show you're doing right now.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.200]   That's the only way it's where it's headed.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.920]   They haven't done anything any good for anybody.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.800]   They're not stopping this AT&T merger, which is a disaster with T-Mobile.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.040]   I don't want that.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   Nobody does.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   But what do we do?
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.200]   Do we, I mean, it's one thing to say start an ISP, Jerry, but I don't know if that's
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   a doable thing.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.620]   If you don't, there's a lot of copper in the ground and I can't start an ISP without the
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.560]   cooperation of the incumbent local carrier, the phone company or the cable company.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.280]   And in fact, the cable company is not even required to sell their access.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   They're the only one.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   Exactly.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.800]   Well, my problem for years was I couldn't get high speed access.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:32.880]   I was three miles from the switch so I couldn't get copper and the cable, my local cable company
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.680]   didn't at that time, don't I?
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.400]   But for a while there was in fact an internet outfit that did it.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:48.200]   It went down when the cables began to provide cheap high speed bandwidth, but it worked
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.600]   for a while as a wireless.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.320]   I built a little Linux box.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.960]   I set it there and I set it up and I had pretty good speed.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.840]   Then when that went away, EarthLink has satellites.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.280]   I was for a while getting my high speed access from a satellite.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.880]   Oh, that was terrible, Jerry.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.880]   You got to agree.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.400]   No, it wasn't terrible.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.560]   It was very fast through put.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:16.000]   It was slow response time because of the delay between here and there.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.520]   So websites that were designed to have 8 million calls to other places took forever
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.400]   alone, but a movie didn't take any time.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.400]   How about this?
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   How about this?
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.800]   What if the government finally released the restrictions on access to the cable and let
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.600]   internet service providers other than Comcast say use the Comcast cable to provide internet
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.440]   service as they've done over the phone lines.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.560]   If they promoted true competition over the phone lines, you know, right now if AT&T doesn't
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.720]   want an independent internet service provider to use their copper, they really can make
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   it pretty difficult.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.880]   I've talked to a lot of independent ISPs who say, "Hey, this is tough."
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.440]   What if they put some teeth in these regulations, really required access, then maybe we would
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   have some competition.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.600]   Admittedly, we only have two big pipes into the house, but at least we could have many
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.240]   service providers over those pipes.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.680]   I think the wireless business is going to put the cables out of business.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.680]   Well, that would be good.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.680]   I don't think...
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   I think wired connectivity is doomed.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:23.680]   Well, then I think the Google Verizon deal, which basically said, "Well, we'll have net
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.640]   neutrality unwired, but let's not stifle the brand new wireless business."
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.280]   It's really kind of is even more scary now.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.280]   They're basically...
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.320]   Just make it easy to get into the wireless business.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.680]   And besides when it's all done, the Isle of Man will put up a satellite and provide you
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   with satellite.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.200]   Let's talk about the Isle of Man space program.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.560]   And just a second, Jerry says, "Isle of Man is the next big superpower in space."
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.800]   I'm going to have to get a map out, Jerry.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.720]   I don't even know where they are.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.120]   Is that a .im domain?
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.600]   Oh, .im.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   Maybe it is.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.120]   I have a .im domain.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.120]   We have Twit.im.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.920]   I bet that's it.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920]   Yeah, I bet it is.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.920]   Well, let's take a break.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   We're going to come back.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.920]   Jerry Parnell is here.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.920]   Steve Gibson.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.640]   John C. Devorak.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.440]   If you're in the chat room, I'd love to get some questions for these guys.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.720]   I know you'd probably like to talk to them.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.160]   It's kind of fun to have some of the great legends of the tech journalism business on
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.160]   with us right now.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.040]   Before we go, though, back to our conversation.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.320]   Let me mention our friends at Citrix.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.040]   I know these guys know Citrix, Ed Yacobucci and his team.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.600]   Ed worked at IBM, came over to Microsoft to work on Windows NT.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.640]   And as a result, he was still working at IBM, but he just helped out Microsoft with
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.640]   Windows NT.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.120]   And as a result, nobody knew the inside guts of Windows better than Ed Yacobucci.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.880]   And Citrix was the result, a great company that does enterprise desktop sharing.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.120]   And of course, they have some great consumer products.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.240]   We talk about them a lot, including go to my PC.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.920]   I don't know if you've ever tried go to my PC.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:04.440]   I know there are a lot of choices when it comes to remote access to your desktop.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.200]   But I got to tell you, go to my PC is the fastest, the easiest to use.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   You'll set it up in minutes.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.120]   You don't need the IT department to do any port forwarding.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.920]   It's 128-bit SSL encrypted.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.440]   It's got NAT traversal, which I wouldn't know what that means, except for Mr. Gibson's
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.400]   explained it all to me in great detail.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.680]   Go to my PC and now on the iPad too.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.120]   So here's the deal.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.080]   You could try it free for 30 days right now.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.320]   Visit go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.840]   You install it on your Mac or PC.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.600]   Once you've got it installed, go to the iTunes store on your iPad.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:42.560]   Get the free client and now you can surf right over to go to my PC.com and enter your secure
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.520]   username and password and you're actually running Windows or Mac on the iPad.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.440]   It is actually mind boggling.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.480]   Remote access from your home, from vacation, from a hotel, anywhere you go.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.200]   As fast as if you're there, as easy to use, you can run any program, access any network
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.640]   resource, even send and receive email.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.600]   It's a true convenience and very affordable too.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   Thank you for the next 30 days.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:14.600]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.400]   Back we go to our Twitch panel.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.200]   Jerry's up and about looking for something.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   I don't know what he...
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:25.440]   I was hanging a tent that was trying to get that bright sun spots off of me, but I...
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.440]   I like it.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.440]   You're shining.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.440]   All right.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.440]   Tell us about there.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   Oh, I see it there.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.440]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.040]   Tell us what's this isleman thing?
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.400]   The isleman has a very high tech promotion.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:47.080]   I think they're trying to be a sort of Silicon Valley in the middle of the United Kingdom.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.040]   They are part of the United Kingdom.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.240]   The Queen is the sovereign, but they are not part of the outfit that's run by the Parliament
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.000]   at Westminster.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   They have their own Parliament.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.160]   In fact, I think they claim it's the oldest Parliament in Europe or something of the sort.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:10.720]   I thought the Icelandic Al thing was, but anyway, they seem to want to promote some
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:17.240]   of my old pro-technology lectures that I made back in the '70s in the doom period when
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.160]   everybody was saying that, you know, by the year 2005, we're going to evolve starve to
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.720]   death and there's going to be this mass die off of people.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.880]   And I basically said that isn't the case.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:36.640]   So they're trying to set me up to do my old lectures that I used to go around doing at
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.960]   colleges.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.000]   And I'm actually looking for trying to set up a technology situation.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.400]   And of course, we got the new bike coming.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.760]   Yeah, well, here it is.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.800]   Here's a video from the isleman.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.280]   I don't know who these guys are.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.680]   Chamber of Commerce promoting their new space program.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   You're right, Steve.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   They're dot I am.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.000]   We've had 33 people look at this video in the last year.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Oh.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.760]   And look at this.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:08.200]   The isleman is the fifth nation, they say, likely to return to the moon.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.560]   They're going to go to the moon.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.560]   Number two, three, and four.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.360]   US, Russia, China, Korea.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.240]   I don't know who else is going to the moon, but you wouldn't.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   Japanese.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   Japanese.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.240]   That's right.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   Alice.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   Alice.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   Is that a country?
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   No, Alice.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.520]   It's from the Jackie Gleason show.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.520]   Get it?
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.560]   Oh, I say I love man.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.600]   But the point is the Japanese are perfectly capable of putting up a.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   Should we go back to the moon?
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   Should man.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.920]   I mean, man space flight be back.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.840]   I know you're a big proponent of a civilian space travel, Jerry.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   Well, you're asking the wrong guy if you want an information answer because I'm very
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.480]   predictable on the subject.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.400]   Isn't information the unpredictable?
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.120]   I mean, obviously, I think we ought to go back.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.560]   I'm heck, I'm the chairman of the lunar society.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   But why?
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.720]   I'm very careful.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   First, why not?
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   But it's a perfectly good place.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   Because it's expensive.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.640]   Well, it can be very profitable.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.240]   The moon is made of a lot of things.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.040]   And we now know there's water there.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.320]   So there is nothing.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.920]   You don't have to import much in order to be able to live there.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:29.440]   It's an easier place to live than that say Iowa was in AP.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.440]   Or Oakland today.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.640]   I think it's a good billboard today.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.560]   The moon, easier than Iowa.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:42.760]   Well, Leo, the whole west was settled by pioneers in covered wagons.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:49.360]   What you probably don't know is that the cost of a covered wagon with a team of oxen
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:56.720]   and plows and rifles and axes and the whole outfit to go out and homestead delivered in
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:03.880]   Independence, Missouri in 1870 was about $100,000 in 1990 dollars.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.480]   In other words, these were upper middle class people deciding to get the heck away from
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.600]   Dodge because the government had got too impressive and they were looking for a place
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.800]   where they could have what they thought was freedom.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.320]   It was the original Tea Party.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   And if you're on the moon, could you do other than just jump real far?
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   What do you do here?
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.120]   What is your usual nature?
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:35.760]   If you're on my recreation among other things you can fly.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.120]   I mean fly with wings.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   How about Mars?
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.960]   There's no air.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:48.680]   Obviously, you have to put the air in.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.760]   I'm with you, Jerry.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.960]   But only because I read a lot of your books and other great science fiction literature
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.240]   and I just love the idea.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.320]   It seems like the future belongs out there.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:06.160]   Well, if the Arthur Clark said it probably better than anybody else, if the human race
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:13.240]   is to have a future, then for 90% of its existence the word ship will mean spaceship.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.200]   Because otherwise we have no future.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.760]   So if we were to terraform the moon, then I guess that would be a great place.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.400]   I don't know how to terraform the moon.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.160]   I know how to terraform Mars, but I don't know how to do it with today's technology.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:34.720]   I don't know how to do it in the sense that if an engineering project building a lunar
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.160]   colony is engineering, not science.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.600]   We know how to do that.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.960]   Yeah, but then you start to get it as science.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:47.720]   I don't know how to keep people alive for two years, which is about the past year, a
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.240]   year and a half or a year or even nine months.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.960]   And in space transit because of solar flares and various other things.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.880]   In space radiation environment is pretty bad.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:07.440]   And the one thing we're absolutely certain is that if you have something like, if you
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:17.080]   had 33 inches of water between you and, or if you have 14.7 pounds per square inch worth
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:23.520]   of medium Z materials between you and the space environment, you can survive.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.520]   How do we know?
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   Because that's what we have.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.320]   That's what what Earth has.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.760]   We've got the atmosphere between us and the space environment.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.120]   And that has taken care of the solar flares and all the rest of it.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.120]   But we don't know.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.640]   I don't know how to get people to Mars.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.080]   That doesn't mean that we won't learn how, but that's science and not just engineering.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:48.120]   But I do know how to put three and a half meters of lunar regolith between you and the
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.720]   space environment.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.120]   You just tunnel under it.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.320]   Dig a hole, right?
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.760]   Did you see that Richard Branson now wants to do a submarine?
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.760]   He's got one.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.960]   It's a beautiful looking thing too.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   It's pretty sweet.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.480]   So I guess in a way that's like space exploration.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.080]   There's all the deep ocean we know is little or less.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:14.200]   I used to be on the board of directors of the Ocean Living Society, which also wanted
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.120]   to build, be central to the ocean colonies.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:25.280]   So he's going to later this year, he's going to go to 36,000 feet below the surface, the
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.320]   Mariana Trench, the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   No one's ever been down there, obviously.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.040]   We don't know what's there at all.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.880]   It's a subduction zone.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   It's crazy.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.680]   Are you excited about that?
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   Well, it's a great place to put nuclear waste.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.320]   I guess.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.240]   Like kind of killed the conversation.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.040]   I wasn't thinking of it that way.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.880]   Maybe there's somebody, something down there might not like that so much.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.000]   I doubt there's much down there, but you never know.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   You don't know till you get there.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:09.160]   We certainly didn't know that there was a non-oxygen, no photosynthesis, life forms
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.880]   around volcanic vents under the ocean until a few decades ago.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:21.040]   We wouldn't want to really upset any super powerful life forms that were just tolerating
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.080]   us being up here on the crust.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:30.040]   Oh, and you don't want to upset big juju and the gods, but you got to take a chance sometimes.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:36.920]   The gods certainly you'll fall off of the edge of the earth if you try to get to the
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.040]   go west from Spain, you know?
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.920]   You got to admire Richard Branson.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.080]   I mean, here's a guy who just doesn't quit.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.960]   This is a crazy nutty idea.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.000]   How does this get to 36,000 feet?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.160]   I mean, doesn't it just, I mean, the pressure down there must be intense.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.880]   What keeps this thing from just squishing like a tin can?
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.520]   Same thing that keeps the diver from squishing like a tin can at 300 feet.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.120]   300 feet is 10 atmospheres, you know.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.800]   Well, what's 36,000 feet?
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   That must be 36,000.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.840]   Oh, divide by 33 feet.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.640]   What do they, they pressurize the inside?
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:21.720]   It did say that the submarine has a one single huge incredibly thick quartz window that they've
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.600]   been carefully polishing and milling.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.880]   I guess like any defect in it could cause a structural weakness in this, but it's going
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.240]   to have a big window on it.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.440]   It's incredibly brave.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   What is the deepest?
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.440]   Really neat.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.440]   What is the deepest we've gone?
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.320]   A manned, manned vessels have gone so far.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.640]   You do understand you balance the inside and the outside pressure.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.520]   You'd have to have as much pressure pushing out as pushing.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.600]   Leo, I think that the number you're looking for is classified.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.200]   Although it's known to be about 20,000, I think.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.800]   So only about half that distance.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.440]   Jiminy Christmas.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.760]   So you think that the military's gone deep, but we just don't know how deep.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.000]   You don't?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   You do?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.800]   I don't have to say.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.200]   Oh.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   Mm.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.640]   Come on, Jerry, you can tell us.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.840]   Tell us, Jerry, we won't tell.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   Nobody watches this.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.240]   Kevin Rose on the show.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.160]   Nobody watches this show anyway, Jerry.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   You're all right.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   You're safe.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.640]   Oh, that's old spooks like to, like to spook you.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.160]   So that's the old, they put the finger by the side of the nose.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.720]   Say I'll never tell.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:38.320]   So the Mariana Trench, deepest unexplored point on our planet, starts at 11,000 feet, but
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.040]   at the bottom of it goes all the way down.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   They're going to do five.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.320]   He's a brave fella.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.280]   I would not be, I'm not sure I'd get in line for this trip.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.280]   Would you?
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.920]   I think what's so fun is to take a camera down there.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   There's a bunch of freaky looking things down there.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   Oh, I see what's down there.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.920]   I mean, I'll be anything at that pressure.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   Who knows?
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.920]   But, yeah.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   I sure like to see.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:04.000]   Well, we know there are some very strange things at very deep depths because sometimes
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.400]   they get washed up.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.320]   Of course, they pretty well explode because they come up too fast.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:17.160]   You do understand that the whole thing about surviving in that kind of environment is the
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.720]   pressure inside and the pressure outside have to be the same.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.160]   And when you change it, that change has to be fairly gradual.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:30.200]   That's why if you scuba dive at 400 feet as I have, it takes longer to come up than you
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.360]   got to spin down there while you were there.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.840]   You just have one of the nice dives is off your maker because there's a mountain that
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:44.320]   comes up and you go down to the bottom and you spiral your way back up it, which is really
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.960]   kind of a nice dive because you have to come up slow.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.680]   If you come up fast, you'll explode.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.400]   That's probably not good for you.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.900]   No.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.320]   You want to keep the inside on the inside and the outside on the outside.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:06.280]   And of course, when you have that big window, there's a lot of square inches on that.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:12.760]   So when you're talking about 36,000 pounds per square inch of pressure, that's multiplied
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.240]   by the number of square inches on that window and you don't want much pressure differential
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.240]   between you and the outside.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.080]   The outside have to be balanced at all times.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:28.640]   Apparently, they're currently doing pressure tests and the sub is holding up.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:35.360]   So what you do is you take really compressed gases with you and you use that to pressurize
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:41.320]   the inside and then you let that out as you come up.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.760]   So I don't know what to make of this.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.160]   This is in slash dot today.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.560]   An investigator for the Air Force.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:54.400]   This is FBI releases document confirming the Roswell UFO.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.480]   Oh balls.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.480]   What?
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.160]   Yeah, what if it were anywhere other than slash dot?
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   It's not April Fool's.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.160]   Last dot.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.160]   I missed that part.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   Next.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.600]   No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.360]   They link back to the FBI dot gov website.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.640]   And the FBI dot gov website is going to show you that the Air Force picked up a whole bunch
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.720]   of junk at the crash site.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.680]   That's what crash was a mogul.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.000]   And mogul was a day.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.360]   You remember if you know anything about the Roswell case, they big thing they make about
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.640]   it is this substance that was hard to tear and flexible and metallic.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:47.480]   It was my aluminum my law, which nobody had in those days, but a balloon that was made
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.680]   of it crashed outside of Roswell.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.680]   It was a it was the mogul project, which was an acoustic.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.240]   It basically flew balloons over the Soviet Union and listened to what it came here on
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.760]   the way by.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.680]   And nobody wanted that to happen.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:06.680]   My first impression when I heard about the Roswell thing is I thought the bombardment
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:12.880]   group had laid an egg that is a loss of a nuclear weapon out there.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.320]   And the secrecy stuff came in real hard.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.720]   It didn't turn out to be that.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.000]   It turned out to be the mogul crush ever since then.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.960]   Roswell made a hell of a good living the entire city out of aliens and the Roswell story.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.080]   But in fact, there is not much to the story.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.000]   It's been a good morning.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   My friend Clara Flock, who was a real my friend Clara Flock was a real true believer.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.800]   He really believed in UFOs.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.080]   He would move on and all these other things.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:49.160]   He got a grant to go right the Roswell story and he dug into it and he dug up everything
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.400]   and he discovered that it was all explainable.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.480]   Poor guy, a damn near broke his heart.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   But it did.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.640]   All right, I'm a changed subject.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   Enough space.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.040]   By the way, I want to mention something.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   John Seed of work.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.800]   By the way, you have a new show X three.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.040]   Tell me about that.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:12.720]   X three is essentially a deconstruction of the old cranky geek show with a few changes.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   In other words, we just do one topic and then that's the show, but we do a bunch of them
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.120]   at once so you can watch a whole bunch.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.120]   It's really short.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.400]   Yeah, they're kind of short, but you can watch as many as you want because we do like 10
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.720]   every time we do them.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.440]   Now the thing that's changed is the same kind of the same set, but I've changed my thinking
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:35.320]   about having guests because I find it was annoying to book guests.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.520]   Yeah, it's too much work and I didn't feel like doing that.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.520]   Sorry.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.560]   I like the idea of a fixed group of guests.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.120]   So I got Andrew Eisner, who's a really smart guy and he knows everything and he works
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.320]   for retrieval and he used to be an editor for one of the big magazines.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:54.680]   And Joango, who's a super nerdy tech, you know, Apple oriented character who knows all
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.720]   kinds of weird stuff I never knew about.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.600]   And you know, he's a DNS guy.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.560]   And so we just have just our group of three and we take news stories and we discuss them
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.640]   and everybody's I don't have to worry about people.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.200]   They don't know what they're talking about and all the rest of it.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.640]   So it's slightly different showing go to X three dot me view.com if you want to watch
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   it.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   It's this is cool.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.880]   So three experts, one topic, right and an ad.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.800]   Three interesting experts, one tough.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.920]   Yeah, no, I like I like the guests.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.920]   Cool.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.240]   I think that's a great idea, John.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   I interrupted you.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.240]   I just wanted to ask you about that.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   Oh, another question.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.240]   Are you a ham?
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.760]   Oh, yeah, I've been a ham for a since November.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   I didn't believe it.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.920]   They told me because we're doing it.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.200]   We're going to start with you believe it.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.520]   It's not that hard to do.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.880]   Well, that's the only possible explain.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.160]   You don't have to learn more anymore.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.560]   No, but you took the test.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.840]   You got the basic thing.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.440]   Are you going to get a equipment and start broadcasting?
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.440]   I already have equipment.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.040]   I got all kinds of I've been collecting gear for a while.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   I got a bunch of gear.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   Yeah, I can broadcast.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.600]   Well, we're going to get you on our show.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.120]   We're doing a new show for Ham's called Ham Nation.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.320]   Ham Nation sounds like something you sound like a food show.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.240]   Ham Nation.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.000]   So no, the thing is I picked up this paranoid attitude some time ago about the fact that
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.800]   if everything goes, especially during Katrina, that if everything goes down, the guys who
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.640]   saved the day were the ham operators because they were on the air.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.400]   Well, nobody wears no power anyplace else.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.000]   You can have your own, but you have a battery.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.640]   You can start broadcasting.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:31.680]   And I came to the conclusion at some point, it's probably a good skill to own in a neighborhood.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.680]   Wow.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.720]   And I think a lot of younger people aren't exploring it.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.120]   And I would say right now that anybody out there listening to this, if you know the
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.840]   basic stuff about computer technology and how to build a machine, for example, you know
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:50.720]   about half of the ham license answers already for the initial license, the technician's
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   license.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.640]   And you can go, you know, it takes probably very little study.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.160]   There's all kinds of online help and lesson plans and testing you can do.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.080]   You can test over and over again until you get it and then you go take a test.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   It's not that difficult.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.560]   And I think more people should do it.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:11.280]   It also prevents guys like that Peter King in Congress who wants to steal all the amateur
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.000]   bands and use them for some commercial crap.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.080]   That's probably not going to do anybody any good.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.800]   When the hams, like I said, had saved the day at Katrina because the government wasn't
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.200]   doing anything.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   So I think this is important.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.920]   Well, if there's a disaster moving in with you.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.760]   Well, John's absolutely right.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:35.320]   One of the worst things that ever happened to this country was when we abolished the
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:41.440]   old civil defense network and set up a federal emergency management agency.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:48.720]   Civil defense was all local organized, local people, ham radio operators, retired firemen,

[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.600]   And it was all voluntary and each one was sort of dedicated to the disaster you're likely
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:04.480]   to have rather than having an agency in Washington that's supposed to be expert on hurricanes,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.000]   oil, well, explosions, earthquakes.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.200]   And you see what I'm getting at.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   It's just stupid.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.080]   There is no way to federalize emergency management.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:18.120]   John, Jerry, I'll bet you remember there was a book that I just worshiped when I was
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.920]   a kid and that was the ARRL handbook.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   Of course.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   Amateur.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.320]   I had a half license a long time ago.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   Radio did you?
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.320]   Yeah, I just don't have time anymore.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.080]   And Steve, are you a ham?
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.760]   Let me talk to you more.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.760]   It's code.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.320]   So I got one back in the days when it was really tough because you had to do 13 words
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:42.240]   a minute to get a ham license and a technology today is really beautiful.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.160]   The equipment.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.520]   John, do you have, have you put up a master?
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.760]   You're going to start broadcasting on the single side band?
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.760]   I mean, what are you?
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.760]   Are you single side bands?
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   Not what you do.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   I don't know.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.360]   I've been on the air a couple of times.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.200]   I've got a mobile rig right now, but I'll probably put an antenna up.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.120]   I've got a, you know, it's not that, it's not that hard to do the whole process.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.280]   It's just a little time consuming.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.200]   I have a, my problem is not so much doing all that.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.600]   I've got all the gear.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   It's just getting organized.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.960]   I'm a disorganized person.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.960]   It's just very annoying.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.960]   Well, that's why when they said John's a ham, I said, no, he's a disorganized person.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.960]   There's no way.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   What are you?
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.280]   10 meters?
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   I got, well, the.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   He's going to walk.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.280]   He's going to walk.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   He'd give him a break.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   No, no, I got.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.960]   I got, I said, all I have some VHF gear right now, but I'm getting some, some higher end
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   stuff.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.920]   A R R L. Amateur American amateur radio.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.720]   Relay, relay, relay, relay league.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   And I imagine you can still get that book.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   Steve, I bet you anything.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.920]   Oh, well, they put out a handbook still.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920]   I'm sure.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.920]   There you go.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.720]   The Ham Radio License Manual Vice Second Edition.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.640]   Yeah, but I mean, the ARRL handbook was, was a lot more than just the license manual.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.640]   Oh, it was a Bible of, of technology.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.400]   I'm sure it's still there somewhere.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.400]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   I got to find it.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   That's great.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.280]   We, I'm now you make me want to get a license.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.280]   I could just get it.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.360]   You know, Leo, you could get your, we take you a week.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.000]   Take you a week of study.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.800]   When they told me you got a license, I thought that must, this test must be so easy.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   Who knows the internet?
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.280]   I actually radio.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   I went to.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.280]   I went to.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   I think I'm an idiot.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   What are you saying this test must be so easy?
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.000]   He just thought there's no way John studied for and took a test.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   It had to be like just the simplest thing.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.640]   So I went to the test and it was hard.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   It was really hard.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.920]   So I, I honor you, John C. de Vorek.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.560]   Leo, you got to remember John used to be an engineer.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.080]   Oh, do you still have the hat?
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.240]   I always, I have my, you do you think in a train engineer?
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.920]   I think you're getting these things mixed up.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.320]   With the stripes.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.160]   John C.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.960]   Oh, you have a Dalmatian.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   That's right.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.760]   John, you should take the, dude, you should go take, do this.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.120]   I took the test on the air.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.720]   I took it right here on Twit Live and I just was horrible.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.200]   I mean, flunk it.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.000]   Not only did I flunk it, I had no idea even what they were asking.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.360]   Oh, don't tackle Jerry.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.360]   Nothing to laugh about.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:18.440]   If you go to ARRL.org, they have the whole, the whole thing so you can take the light.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.640]   They have tests, yeah, question, see this is what I did.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.720]   I did the question pool.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.120]   See, so you could take the questions and, and see, you got the technician class, right,
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   John?
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   Yep.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   That's the one for Dummies.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.840]   Yeah, it's the one for Dummies, but I'll get the general one when I feel like it.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   It's not that hard.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.240]   I'm already, I'm like two or three questions away from passing that.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   Wait a minute though.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.600]   The radio works even if you don't have a license, right?
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   Okay.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:47.120]   Yeah, but you're just seeing and the fine treatment of the person who has happened, you plug
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.000]   in and talk to somebody.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.800]   You could, but you'll be caught.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   There's a bunch of these.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.560]   Not if there's a disaster going on.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.720]   What are they going to do?
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.280]   Amongst his group of people, there's a whole bunch of these, I don't know how to describe
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.120]   them except maybe ankle biters or, or these very officious hall monitor types.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.080]   Who are basically monitoring 24/7.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.080]   Right.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.520]   Looking for guys like you trying to cheat the system and they will bust you and you will
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.600]   get fine and it will cost you a lot of money and it'll be a hassle.
