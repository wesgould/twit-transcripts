[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.800]   I'm surrounded by YouTube stars this week.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.240]   We'll talk about Facebook's F8 conference
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.600]   when anonymity isn't truly anonymous.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.800]   Twitter's tumble on the stock market,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800]   and Microsoft blinks.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.000]   It's all coming up next, don't do it.

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.040]   It's time for Twit this week in tech,
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.960]   the show where we covered the week's tech news
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080]   in all its Florida glory.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.440]   Speaking of Florida glory, Robert Scobull is here.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.280]   We're not one but two devices that
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.000]   could take pictures surreptitiously.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.560]   Hey, Robert, it's going to see you.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.520]   The Scobullizer is got a Google Glass.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.960]   And I recognize the narrative clip.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.440]   This is good because it's more stealth
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.800]   because it is a camera every 30 seconds it takes a picture.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.000]   And if you double tap it, it'll take you next time.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.360]   We'll talk about that.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.000]   Robert was also at the Facebook Developers Conference, F8.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.280]   We'll talk about that.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.600]   To his right, Mr. Brian Brushwood from Scam School
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.560]   and the new show NSFW is now called
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.240]   Night Attack at nightattack.tv.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.800]   And it's filtier than ever.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.880]   It's finally actually NSFW.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.240]   Not that we weren't extremely thankful
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.360]   for the platform of Twitch.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.400]   But man, do we use the F word a lot now.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.880]   - Really, that was your goal in life.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.040]   It's just somewhere, find a platform,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160]   somewhere that I can swear more.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.000]   - There was some clip where Bonnie walked in
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.840]   and we were playing it.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.160]   She goes, "Congratulations, Brian.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.760]   "Just wait till your daughter finds this."
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.880]   - So it was inside Amy Schumer that they did a kind of a du--
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.360]   Did you see this, the Dushy Scam School?
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.200]   I'm coming. - No.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.040]   - Central, have you seen this?
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   - Now, as we all know,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.560]   gravity goes down, yes?
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.120]   But we all focus.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.800]   Sometimes gravity can make things go up.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.880]   - Now, this is--
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.140]   (laughing)
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.520]   - That's what this guy does for a living.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.040]   - This reputation that magicians have,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.120]   they earned it, man.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.560]   That kind of thing doesn't come out of nowhere.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.280]   There's a billion of those guys actually out.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.200]   But yes, I agree.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.680]   Dushy's version escapes forever.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.080]   Hey, look who else is here, MKBHD,
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   Marquez Brownlee, great to have you once again.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.440]   Welcome back. - Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.320]   - I bet we have something that you don't have,
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.800]   but I should never say that.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.280]   But I see that Robert Scobel here has the new HTC One,
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   but everybody's got the HTC One MA.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.080]   But this is the new Sprint version,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   the Harmon Carton version they announced last week.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.280]   Have you played with that yet, Marquez?
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.200]   - I have not.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.040]   I have not.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.880]   - Yeah.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.320]   - I have the Google Play Edition One
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.560]   and I have the AT&T One.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.640]   - I'm a fan of the MA.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.480]   I just got the Nokia 1520 just to see
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.560]   what a six inch phone would be like.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.640]   And I like it enough,
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.240]   but it doesn't have enough Google services.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.520]   Now what's interesting about this one,
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.960]   and I know you just got it.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.480]   So you haven't played with it yet,
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.040]   is this is the so-called Harmon Carton edition.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.560]   It has the capability of playing back this high bit rate files,
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.880]   the 192.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.480]   - And they sent me a really nice Harmon Carton wireless speaker.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.640]   That's called Bribery.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.920]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.240]   - You don't get to keep it though.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.080]   I don't know.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.960]   - Yeah, if you don't ask, you do.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.040]   - Again, have a return shipping commitment.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.560]   - I think this is interesting because, you know,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.680]   Neil Young has made a lot of hay
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.240]   with his Pono player raised quite a bit of money
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.080]   on Kickstarter for basically the same idea,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.000]   a player that can play instead of the MP3s were used to,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.680]   which really, I mean, I think everybody agrees.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.000]   There's a, you give up a certain amount
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.720]   when you do an MP3, but even uncompressed flag files,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.280]   but even recorded at higher bit rates,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   the CD is 41 kilohertz, what is it, 41 kilohertz by 16 bits,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.840]   sample resolution. - Right.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   - And, you know, I asked Joe Walsh when he was on Ham Nation,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.960]   what do you record in?
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.800]   And he says, well, 44, 124.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.360]   'Cause I said, what, don't, why don't you do it higher?
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.080]   He says, 'cause it takes up too much disk space.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.800]   And nobody can hear the difference.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.640]   - That's not true.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.880]   - There's some debate over, you know,
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.080]   whether you can hear this high bit rate.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.920]   - You can actually, if you get into a double testing lab.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.760]   - Can you tell the difference?
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   - You can tell the difference.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.320]   Most people can actually.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.920]   - And so theoretically-- - Steeratically--
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.360]   - Olive down at Harmon.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.640]   - I think people can, but I don't know if I can,
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.680]   'cause I'm so old, but theoretically this phone will do,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.400]   if you have to have good headphones.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.480]   - Yeah, yeah, like these, that's why
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.560]   we brought the JBL headphones.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.400]   - Oh, okay.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.080]   - And do you know if there's 192.24 music on here?
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.320]   - I haven't seen it yet.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.200]   (laughs)
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.240]   - I'm literally the only person on this panel
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.280]   young enough to hear the difference is probably Marquette.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.320]   What do you think of the idea of how it is?
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.960]   - I like to scroll like the Coachella,
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.160]   so my hearing's all gone.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   - You're deaf now anyway.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.360]   (laughs)
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.240]   - I mean, I'm convinced that this is the age
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.640]   of music entering basically like wines.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.280]   You got fine wines, and yeah, there's like three dudes
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.720]   who can maybe taste the difference
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.000]   between this wine and that wine.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.960]   The rest of us, you know, can buy two buck chuck
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.120]   and think it's great and not have any idea.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.280]   I think that's, I'm pretty sure that's where we are
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.760]   with audio at this point.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.160]   - It's golden ears.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.800]   - Yeah, it's funny, it's Spotify inside the settings
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.760]   has a way to download higher bit, right?
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.960]   And it does sound better to my ears,
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.800]   but most people don't even--
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.640]   - Still not even three, so.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.160]   - But most people don't even know that's there, right?
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.120]   - And it'll be interesting to compare the Pono.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.040]   Also THX has a new format that surrounds sound audio.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.440]   That's sort of neat.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.280]   - Thank you.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.440]   - It'll be interesting to compare all these different formats.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.320]   - Don't be antihx keep pushing surround sound
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.920]   headphone stuff and it just never gets picked up.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.800]   It'll be picked up by the video game people.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.960]   - Right.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.800]   So Pono raised $6 million, they wanted 800,000,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.000]   they raised $6 million, 18,000 people, including me,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.520]   I bought one, but it won't be up till September.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.360]   But Marques, you're literally, you're the only guy
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.080]   with acute enough, you're young enough that you have
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.720]   acute enough hearing that you could tell a difference.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.520]   Have you listened to any of this high quality stuff?
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.000]   - I really do, I just have a lot of MP3s and a lot of WAV files.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.720]   And I don't record any higher.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   You see, kids today, your generation grew up with iPods
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.920]   and little earbuds and that's all you expect.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.960]   And what I'm recording, I'm uploading to the web
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.640]   just to YouTube, which compresses everything
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.480]   and no anyway.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.120]   So even if I did record and master at a way higher
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.160]   resolution, you wouldn't really hear the difference
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.000]   on YouTube.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.840]   - Well, it's the same thing for us.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.560]   I mean, we could shoot this at 1080p, but why?
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.720]   Do you shoot at 720 or 1080?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.240]   - I shoot at 2160p and you can get a higher,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.320]   YouTube will stream at a higher bit rate
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   when you shoot in 4K so I can upload in 45 megavits per second
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.720]   rather than, or export in 45 megavits per second
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.080]   rather than 10, which is the max for 1080p streaming.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.080]   So I do--
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   - So you shoot at 4K?
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.320]   - Yeah. - Wow.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.600]   - Master, the theory YouTube goes 4K,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.720]   but it's the same thing.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.920]   You have to compress it so much, you can't imagine it.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.720]   - I just don't have enough upload speed.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.120]   (laughing)
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.520]   - I'll be there all night, I'm floating one video.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.120]   - Yeah, and YouTube takes forever to process those files too,
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.000]   'cause if I'm uploading a 1080p five minute video,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.640]   it'll be done processing in five minutes,
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.840]   but if I upload this 4K video that's four gigs,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.760]   it takes YouTube like an hour or two to fully process,
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.080]   to actually show that resolution.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.000]   - So why do you upload MK4 HD video?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.720]   - I have a 4K monitor and I like high res video
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.040]   in the first place, so I'm just kind of
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.400]   future proofing it for now, for the day in maybe six years
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.360]   when someone's watching an older video.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   - I love being that one.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.840]   - And things say this looks good.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.960]   - You have, that's right, last time we talked about that,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.000]   but you did, did you get a 60 Hertz 4K monitor
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.560]   were you able to?
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.160]   - Yeah, I have the Asus PQ321Q.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.200]   - That's right.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.480]   - This place, so there--
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.960]   - That's the only 60 Hertz ones out there, as far as I know.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.320]   - Right, a Thunderbolt, yeah.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.400]   - Are you running a Mac Pro on that sucker?
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.120]   - Yes, sir, yes I am.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.800]   - Bastard.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.640]   (laughing)
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.200]   - YouTube, and everybody, good to me.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.240]   This is the guy I got 120,000 comments
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.400]   on one, on a single YouTube video.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.080]   - Yeah.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.920]   - But that was a giveaway, what were you giving away?
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.680]   - I give away the Nexus here, I can actually show it.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.120]   I give away another one of these,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.120]   it's the Nexus 5 with a skin on the back with my logo on it.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.560]   - MKBHD version.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.400]   - Right.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.240]   - Oh wow.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.280]   - You got 120,000 comments.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.760]   - Wow.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.320]   - Wow.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.600]   - All those entries.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.440]   - It's amazing.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.040]   - Let's see, what should we talk about?
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.880]   - It takes a lot to get--
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.720]   - What day is it, Leo?
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.560]   - Leo jealous of somebody else's numbers.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.400]   (laughing)
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.840]   - I'm very jealous of my kids.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.480]   - I'm very jealous of my kids.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   What day is it, it's March the 3rd.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.760]   No, I'm sorry, it's May the 4th be with you.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.600]   - March.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.360]   (dramatic music)
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   - A long time ago, in a podcast far, far away.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.560]   - This is fantastic, I love the copyright-free version
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.960]   of the Star Wars theme.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.160]   (laughing)
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.280]   - We didn't actually wanna play John Williams famous music,
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.920]   so you know what they do, they just turn it up a key,
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.000]   they take out a note and that's it.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.240]   (laughing)
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.560]   - Oh, God.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.400]   (laughing)
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.560]   - By the way, I misspoke, it was DTS, not THX on the--
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.440]   - DTS, right.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.360]   - Yeah.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   So, yeah, May the 4th--
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.200]   - Thanks.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.600]   - See, this is Star Wars day, there are people,
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.920]   in fact there's somebody in the audience right now
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.200]   who was watching all six Star Wars movies in sequence,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.240]   as is traditional on May the 4th,
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   you see, she's looking at you.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.400]   - Just promised me they're the disspecialized editions,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.160]   the only valid version.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.680]   - This is why people don't sit in the front row,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.280]   so a guy's here with his girlfriend,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.920]   long suffering girlfriend, right?
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.480]   No, wife?
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.680]   But just somebody you know?
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.520]   - Mistress.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.680]   - Old friend.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.200]   (laughing)
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.640]   Old friend.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   And I mention Star Wars day, and she looks at him and goes,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.840]   "Nah."
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.080]   - Yeah, so if you think that's the kind of thing he would do,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.200]   watch all six Star Wars movies one after the other,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.320]   without eating, yeah?
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.080]   - More like Lord of the Rings.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.000]   That's a pretty big commitment.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.800]   There's only three of them, but I feel like
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.000]   it's more time than six Star Wars movies.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.760]   It feels like it just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.960]   Anyway, happy Star Wars day.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.480]   Can you believe it's almost 40 years?
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.240]   It's 37 years since Star Wars.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.080]   - That's crazy.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.280]   - 37 years.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.080]   - I saw it 13 times in the first week.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.920]   You never were a guy to just kind of take it easy, were you?
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.760]   - No.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.600]   (laughing)
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.160]   I was in junior high, I think I was 13.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.920]   - 13 times?
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.760]   - Yeah.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.600]   - You just kept going back?
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.320]   - Since the best movie I'd ever seen.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.160]   (laughing)
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.000]   - But that was 13.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.840]   - 1977.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.160]   - Yeah.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.920]   No, I just went once.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.160]   So that was pretty good.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.960]   Well, anyway, happy Star Wars day.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.400]   So you went to the Facebook, actually, let's take a break.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.760]   And when we come back, we'll talk about F8
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.760]   and a lot more.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.600]   And who did that?
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   It was Anthony Nielsen did that fabulous--
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   - Yeah, that intro.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.640]   - Star Wars crawl.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.280]   And of course, you notice our, we call it in the trade
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.400]   lower third.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.600]   - Chiron in the trade.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.120]   - I'm sorry, pardon me.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.440]   (laughing)
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.800]   So Chiron.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.560]   - It's got big timed by Jen.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.400]   That was amazing.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.240]   - Woo!
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   - Yeah.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.080]   - Yes, I'm sorry.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.080]   I apologize.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.360]   The Chiron, well, he probably went to broadcasting school
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.000]   for an half semester.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.280]   (laughing)
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   Is in the star, is it a star?
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.200]   You know, I'm gonna say Star Trek before too long.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.040]   So I just stay in now.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.880]   Star Trek, I mean, Star Wars font.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.000]   I like it.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.680]   We maybe could keep this.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.040]   We could redo the whole thing.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.160]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.880]   Do not, whatever you do, go to the post office.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.800]   Well, you can't even go to the post office on Star Wars day.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.440]   Though all the clerks are home watching the movies.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.360]   But what if you needed a stamp, right?
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.640]   Well, Stamps.com, you could actually anytime.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.880]   24/7, print out legal US postage for any kind of package
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.120]   or letter, right from your computer and your printer.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.160]   And then tomorrow, the mail carrier comes to pick it up.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.480]   Take it away.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.320]   Stamps.com.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.200]   If you are eBay or Etsy seller, if you're a business
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.480]   and you wanna, you know, you don't want,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.520]   lick stamps and put them on the envelope.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.880]   The other day I got an envelope, 85 cent postage
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.120]   to envelope from a company that wanted me
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.320]   to review a product.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.600]   It's like that is a bad first impression
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.480]   that I have to pay 85 cents to review your product.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.160]   Don't be that guy.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.800]   Go to Stamps.com.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.960]   You can buy and print official postage.

[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.240]   for priority mail.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.720]   They'll automatically send an email to your recipient
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.040]   with the tracking code.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.840]   The whole thing, it makes it, it's professional fulfillment
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.560]   for anybody, for any small business.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.600]   We use it all the time here.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.680]   In fact, we have two accounts, we use it so much.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.360]   You don't have to buy special ink.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.080]   You don't have to buy a postage meter
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.520]   whenever the postage rate changes.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.680]   Postage meter companies will actually charge you money
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.680]   to update their postage meter, not with Stamps.com.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.040]   The postage rate is automatically updated.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   You get a USB scale, I'm gonna tell you how you can do that
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.560]   so you always have exactly the right postage.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.480]   You know more, not enough stamps.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.880]   Or worse, too many stamps.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.960]   You ever put too many stamps on to make sure it goes through,
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.360]   you don't get a postage due.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.200]   You don't wanna do that.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.040]   That's wasting money.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.840]   Stamps.com, you'll even save money
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.720]   because you'll get discounts
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.460]   you can't get at the post office.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.120]   Visit Stamps.com right now.

[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.000]   a $110 bonus offer.

[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.880]   You get activities, kit of stuff.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.120]   You get a postage, free postage, $55 worth of free postage
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.440]   that you can use over the first few months
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.280]   of your subscription.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.320]   It's worth all told $110, including of course,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.800]   30 days free of Stamps.com.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.120]   Go to Stamps.com before you do anything else.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.080]   Click the microphone at the top of the home page
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.960]   and type in twittstamps.com.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.040]   So FA this year, first of all, they haven't had
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.120]   a Facebook developer's conference in three years.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.960]   Something like that.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   It's a long time between conferences.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.800]   I think you look at Apple, you look at Google
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.520]   and their developer conferences are big deals.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.320]   It really is an important thing to get developers
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.880]   in your corner.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.600]   Facebook's obviously realized this.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   And I bought PARS last year.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.960]   Well, that's one of the things they showed, yeah.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.560]   So I, first of all, Mark Zuckerberg leads it off.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.400]   He looks great.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.480]   He's very much in command.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.320]   He's not the shy guy you've interviewed him many times.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.640]   He's almost 30.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.360]   He's grown up a lot.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.640]   Yeah, and he's confident and he's worldly now.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.840]   And he's a billionaire.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.000]   Well, he's not only a billionaire.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.600]   He's got 1.2 billion customers.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.720]   Active, that's an amazing thing.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.560]   So he did a couple of interesting things.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.640]   For a long time, Facebook's philosophy was kind of
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.920]   fail fast, break things early and fix them.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.440]   The hacker culture, he said, well, that served us well.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.880]   We want to be a platform now.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.840]   We want to be stable and consistent.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.320]   That's a big change for Facebook.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.040]   Yeah, which means he's going to move slowly.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.360]   The days of some 20 year old checking in some code
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.440]   without having a committee check it over first
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.240]   is probably over.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.000]   It strikes me that what they're saying is that,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.400]   well, I feel like this has happened.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.240]   You guys tell me that Facebook realized,
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.400]   as Google has realized and others have realized,
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.000]   that the monolithic portal page that you go to
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.120]   and everything's there is dead.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.400]   The mobile is where it's happening now, right?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.680]   I think Google knew this all along, it seems,
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.160]   that all Google said is, look, we'll just do
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.360]   all these different things, some of which you'll use,
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.240]   some of which you won't.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.760]   And we'll make sure that the information we gather
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.720]   about you is shared across all those platforms.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.360]   We have basically an ad network.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.040]   And when you use Google Docs or Google Voice
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.320]   or G+, or Google Mail or any of our services,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.200]   you'll see consistent ads across--
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.880]   New drive apps came out this week, right?
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.720]   So they did, they, and I think Facebook might have realized
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.000]   this with the acquisition of Instagram and then WhatsApp.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.880]   They don't need to fold those into Facebook.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.840]   In fact, it's better if they don't.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.280]   People wanna use apps for specific purposes.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.680]   And then Facebook is now gonna become the platform
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.040]   underneath, the ad platform underneath.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.120]   And to do that and to get developers to use it,
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.960]   you've got, you can't be changing every three minutes,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.520]   you can't have a 12 year old file.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.000]   No, one problem with apps is if you click a link
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.080]   on the Facebook app to maybe a SoundCloud, for instance,
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.040]   it takes you into the web page.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.880]   Right.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.720]   And they--
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.560]   They're gonna fix that.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.920]   They just announced a protocol that'll take you
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.320]   to the SoundCloud app.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.400]   Now, people aren't all that happy about some of these moves
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.360]   because they really are, if you look at it,
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.280]   frankly, they are taking over the app ecosystem.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.840]   Take them over the web.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.280]   Well, the app ecosystem, which is the new web, right?
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.120]   You know?
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.920]   I read on my mobile phone far more than I read
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.000]   on a desktop anymore.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Zuckerberg promised two years consistency in the API minimum.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.400]   So if there's an API call and you're as a developer,
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.880]   you're using it, you can be guaranteed,
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.640]   it'll be good for two years.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.280]   We're going to pay more attention to customers.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   We're trying to build, he says, a stable mobile platform.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.240]   This seems to be a big change.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.400]   The ad network is really the big thing.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.320]   And most people aren't gonna get crazy,
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.600]   passionate about an ad network,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.760]   but the numbers will start showing up
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.520]   in the next quarterly results.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.720]   And that's when we're gonna see the effect of that new network.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.040]   Most of the developers say it's really well done.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.640]   - I'll tell you what, man, that's all great for Facebook.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.920]   But as a consumer, there's only one thing I care about
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.560]   and that's the anonymous login.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.400]   - Right.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.160]   - It's weird because on the one hand,
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.440]   I applaud that he does it,
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.680]   but there's so much damned hypocrisy.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.520]   What was it?
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.560]   Quote, "I can sign in on my own terms."
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.320]   Quote, "We don't want anyone to ever be surprised
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.000]   "about how they're sharing on Facebook,"
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.160]   which is a very magnanimous statement
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.920]   from a man who built an empire
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.920]   by surprising people about what they're sharing on Facebook.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.640]   - Yeah, that's what I said.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.680]   He's starting to grow up.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.320]   He's starting to realize that
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.360]   changing all the time pisses people off.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.800]   And he's doing things to be more user-centric.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.640]   - But wait a minute.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.320]   - He's in Facebook.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.480]   - Anonymous login completely cynical
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.400]   because you're anonymous to the app developer,
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.720]   but you're exactly not anonymous to Facebook.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.440]   What the value to Facebook is
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.800]   is to get you to use all these different things
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.440]   and collect information about you across all of these platforms.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.760]   - There's a lot of ways to look at it as a sentence.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.520]   - First of all, the anonymous button
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.040]   takes away screen space that Amazon or Microsoft
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.880]   or Google could use. - Does you have
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.000]   the Facebook connect?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.240]   And then underneath it, Facebook anonymous link.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   That's the bar where Google+ would be.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.400]   - And there ain't that much space on a mobile phone.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.600]   So right there took away another button possibility
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.440]   from somebody else.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.280]   That's one we just saw.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.560]   - I didn't even think about this
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.280]   as being an insidious way to go like a second level deeper
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.440]   where you not only tell people that they're,
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.840]   man, that's dark where it's like you increase
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.600]   the likelihood of somebody using yours
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.440]   because you have the word anonymous in there.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.560]   And then in fact, it's totally not anonymous
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.240]   and they're just collecting even more data.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.800]   That's horrific.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.200]   - This is Brownlee. - But Mark gets Brownlee.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.400]   Will people notice that?
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.440]   I mean, will people see the word anonymous
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.520]   and just go, "Yeah, that's cool."
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.960]   - I don't know if anyone's gonna change.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.680]   I mean, the people who care about it will probably click it
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.880]   and hopefully it'll be doing what it says it's doing,
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.120]   but I personally probably wouldn't.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.680]   - So you're saying people aren't gonna ever trust Facebook
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.160]   whether it says anonymous or not?
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.680]   - That's absolutely not true in the stats.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.560]   The app developers, I know, say, man,
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.400]   a major proportion of their people
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.080]   are using Facebook to sign in
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.560]   because it saves you putting that damn username
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.680]   and password in for all these stupid apps.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.040]   And their pitch to the developers was
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.680]   if you put this anonymous button in,
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.240]   more people will try your app
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.840]   because they know that they won't give you any deep data.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.480]   And there is something to do--
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.880]   - Or a summation of most on your behalf or whatever.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.160]   - Right, because you click anonymous,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.240]   the app developer, the app doesn't know anything about me.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.520]   - But that's the only one who doesn't.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.000]   And will app developers give up that information?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.200]   You know what app developers do now.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.240]   You log in with Facebook and then they say,
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.360]   okay, now give us your email address, your password.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.200]   You still have to--
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.120]   - The worst one, in any case.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   - The best ones don't do that.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.400]   - Best one is friction free.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.600]   - Yeah, but you're giving up something as an app developer.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.560]   You're giving up access to your customers.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.640]   - Absolutely.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.720]   And they say that-- - And you're right.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.520]   Is Facebook so powerful that they'll do that?
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.400]   - I think so.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.800]   Based on talking to the developers in the audience,
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.000]   they say, yeah, we like this because it's yet another way
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.280]   to get people to sign into an app and try it
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:37.160]   without having to type in your username and password.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   And they know that they lose people
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.960]   on username and password.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.480]   I know I do it, I have to fill out a bunch of stuff.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.920]   When I first get an app, sometimes I go and do something else.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.400]   - Facebook feels a little creepy here
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.960]   'cause they're going to developers, they're saying,
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.840]   okay, we got this, we're gonna give you some money.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.320]   We'll help you with your dit-parsas
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.960]   about helping them with their database
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.840]   so that they'll provide back-end.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   So it feels a little bit like that creepy guy
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.120]   on the family guy.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.520]   Come here, little boy.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.520]   I just like your muscles, that's a nice app.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.040]   Would you mind if I can't--
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.560]   - I can't argue because at Rackspace I do the same thing.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.960]   I'm the drug plus your Rackspace.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.120]   - But the difference on Rackspace is
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.080]   it's first of all, it's open source software, right?
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.320]   It's an open stack.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.240]   And you're not really, Rackspace is not collecting information
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.640]   on my customers.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.160]   They're facilitating it.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.920]   Facebook's saying, hey, well, hey, forget the Rackspace,
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.080]   the Amazon web services, forget the Google code,
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.840]   we'll do all of that for you.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.880]   You'll be in our ecosystem, it'll be a good thing.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.080]   And I think that's tempting.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.120]   I mean, I even think for us as potential app developers
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.400]   we'd be tempted by that 'cause it's our customers.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.080]   - No, and they're not the only one doing it.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.960]   Google's out there with an identity play.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.720]   Twitter's out there with an identity play.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   And Microsoft is trying, but Microsoft is just not
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.000]   part of this world.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.120]   - What was really interesting too was I didn't see any
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.080]   Microsoft stuff on the Facebook stage.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.960]   - But you didn't see any Apple stuff, did you?
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.640]   - No, there was a lot of Apple talked about.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.960]   - Ah, interesting.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.880]   - Well, they know that iOS, they gotta be on iPhones.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.920]   iPhone and Android are the two platforms.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.280]   And they talk a lot about, no, not a single mention.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.640]   - Like I used--
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.480]   - No.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.320]   (laughing)
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.160]   - No.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.840]   - And that also matches all the startups I talk with, right?
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.680]   - No, I got it.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.560]   - Very few of 'em killed Windows phone apps.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.880]   - Robert, walk me through this,
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.360]   because if I'm an app developer, I understand the benefits
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.320]   of buying into the Facebook ecosystem for ease of acquisition
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.800]   of new members.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.440]   But it seems like an individual login
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.840]   and an email address would be much more valuable
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.400]   if what I wanna do is sell stuff down the road.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.520]   - It might be, but when you log in with Facebook,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.680]   first of all, your users don't churn because it's one click.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   - And then you get, if your users say yes,
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.840]   you get access to their birthday, to their friends.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.680]   - Facebook, yeah.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.040]   - So Facebook will lie--
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.560]   - Wait, but not if you use the anonymous one,
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.400]   you don't get this whole--
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.320]   - Not the anonymous one.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.160]   But you know how this is gonna work.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.720]   If I'm an app developer, I'm gonna offer anonymous,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.640]   and then at every turn, you're gonna try to do something
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   like comment on my--
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   - Oh gee, if I knew more about you, I'd help you.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.080]   - Yeah, yeah, will you please give us full access
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.160]   to your Facebook profile or sign in
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.200]   with a username and password, yeah?
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.880]   - You know how that's gonna play down, right?
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.280]   - So I think that overall,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.720]   what the most interesting thing here,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.440]   and I have to give credit to Mike Elgin,
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.040]   our news director in the host of TNT,
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.640]   for first highlighting this for me,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.840]   is this notion that the monolithic webpage is dead.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.440]   I think, in fact, I saw an article the other day
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.960]   that agrees with me, not only are we gonna post PC era,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.160]   we're in a post tablet era,
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.840]   we're in everything on the mobile phone era.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.680]   And so, the web experience on the mobile phone is tough,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.320]   it's too small a screen, it's apps are where it's at there.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.760]   We're in an era where, frankly,
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.720]   all of these big companies are gonna say,
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.600]   "We don't need to have one page,
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.280]   "we need to have as many apps as possible,
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.800]   "and if it could be our own apps,
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.400]   "it could be through a relationship with an app developer."
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.440]   But all of them using either the Google ad platform,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.880]   or the Facebook ad platform,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.320]   or the Microsoft ad platform, or the Yahoo ad platform.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.640]   - And that's where Andrid's way ahead.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.600]   If you use some of the newer app launchers,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.040]   the contextual app launchers,
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.320]   they will actually pull in apps onto your screen
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.440]   that you don't even have loaded yet.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.840]   And Apple just doesn't let developers do that.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.920]   And also, the app ecosystem on Andrid is more connected.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.680]   I can actually deep link into your app,
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.240]   which I can't do on iPhone.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.600]   And the fact that Facebook is now coming out with linking
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.880]   for apps tells me that Apple is in a bad position here.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.040]   They really should-- - Office-press Apple
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.280]   is gonna allow that.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.280]   - I would, doesn't Apple have the right to say no,
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.760]   you cannot click a link in an app and launch another app?
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.000]   - I'm shocked that Apple hasn't done it themselves,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   because if Apple doesn't keep its ecosystem up to date,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.800]   people will start switching.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.960]   And already 90% of the market's on Andrid,
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.600]   so it doesn't take a whole lot more to get us off of this iPhone.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.640]   - So, Marcus Brownlee, I just hate to keep using you
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.160]   as the young person.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.760]   But really, your usage is what everybody cares about.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.280]   They don't care how Scobler, I, or even Brian Brushwood
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.120]   uses stuff.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.840]   They care about how people in your age cohort use this stuff.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.680]   - Right.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.400]   - What do you and your cohort, how do you use this stuff?
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.840]   How, where are they, for instance,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.480]   that this is even going on?
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.280]   - As a college student, just looking around it,
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.720]   like the way people use apps and trying to,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.280]   I guess, sign in to stuff, it's obviously way easier
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.320]   to just sign in with your Facebook account,
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.920]   never worry about it again.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.480]   There's also apps that use Google+,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.920]   and if you have a Google+, I use that for SoundCloud
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.400]   every time I set it up, it's just one click, so that's easy.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.160]   - So, then they're not thinking about privacy, particularly,
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.000]   or anything like that?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.200]   - No, not a lot.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.400]   I mean, I have certain classes where it's sort of
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.160]   a vocal minority where everyone in the class is concerned
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.560]   about it because it's a class about security
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.360]   or a class about innovation policy or something,
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.800]   where we talk a lot about that stuff,
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.320]   but outside of that, it seems like not a whole lot of concern.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.600]   - So, I'm curious about Snapchat in that regard,
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.800]   Snapchat, which really did well out of the box
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.600]   because that was the app that you could take a picture
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.920]   and then say, and they can only look at it
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.720]   for 10 or 20 or 30 seconds, and it just took over the world.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.680]   In fact, they turned down a $3 billion offer.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.200]   Was it from Google or Facebook?
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.040]   I can't remember, I think Google,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.800]   saying, "No, we're gonna be worth more than that."
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.720]   My daughter, yesterday, she sat in the sofa,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.880]   she said, "Oh, dad, Snapchat just updated."
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.720]   I said, "Oh, really?"
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.720]   She said, "Yeah, they added phone calls and texting."
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.880]   And so, Snapchat clearly sees this as an opportunity.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   I think that could be a mistake, though.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.640]   An application that gets too complicated.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.600]   One of the reasons Snapchat was so popular
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.800]   is it was very straightforward.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.880]   - Well, we're seeing the same thing with Twitter, right?
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   Aren't they talking about kind of whisper conversations?
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.720]   - Disappearing tweets?
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.400]   - Yeah, what about like--
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.720]   - What about like the imply that they'd be doing it,
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.800]   they haven't done it yet.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   - The whispering, "Your classmates use Snapchat, right?"
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.000]   Mark has it?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.840]   - Yeah.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.680]   - Yeah.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.800]   - What was the reaction to the new app
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.560]   where they just kind of freaked?
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.440]   - I haven't seen the reaction to the new,
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.200]   actually I've seen one guy's reaction.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.880]   So when I first saw it, it came out.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.520]   All the coverage of it seemed to be very positive
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.080]   and glowing, but my initial impression was,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.440]   "Wow, that's a lot more complicated
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.880]   "than Snapchat was when it started out."
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.440]   So I wonder how are people even gonna try it
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.400]   to use this a lot or are they just gonna keep using it
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.640]   the same way they used it before?
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.400]   - My son is 20, he says they are using it
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.520]   and he really likes the--
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.840]   - 'Cause it's disappearing texts as well right now.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.160]   - Yeah.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.720]   - What did your friend say everybody was on Snapchat?
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.800]   - Yeah, but that was before the change.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.920]   What did your friend say, Mark, yes?
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.040]   - My friend didn't know how to use it.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.240]   He was like, "Oh, 'cause I got the update next to him."
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.800]   And he was like, "Oh, is that the new Snapchat?"
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.640]   I was like, "Yeah."
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   So he was like, "Okay, I'll grab the update."
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.860]   And he updated it and he was like,
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.120]   "Okay, I don't know what's going on anymore.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.360]   "There's more swipes than there's--"
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.640]   - Yeah, my daughter's the same thing.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.640]   She's 22. - Yeah.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.960]   - She said, "I don't, I--"
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.400]   (laughs)
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.240]   - I think a lot of people are gonna try to continue
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.560]   using it the way they were before
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.280]   and if they happen to stumble upon another thing
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.320]   that they kinda like, then, "Oh, hey, that's a bonus.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.560]   "I'll start using that more too."
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.240]   But I didn't really get any walkthrough
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.080]   or instructions of, "Hey, this is the new feature."
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.920]   You just got like a three--
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   - The video was really cool.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.480]   If you swipe down, it actually switches the camera
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.080]   to the front facing camera.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.000]   - Yeah, it does that now.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.040]   - And it's pretty well done.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.880]   - If you actually do play with it, it's pretty well done.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.560]   - But that's the question.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.920]   - Can we-- - Is it better to be an app
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.040]   that does one thing well,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.200]   which seems to be what Mark Zuckerberg's promoting,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.920]   do one thing well and will provide you
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.120]   with inter-app communications if you wanna do other things?
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.360]   - I mean, first of all, it seems to me
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.240]   like the Facebook angle is, you know,
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.200]   they obviously are sitting on a mountain of cash
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.120]   and goodwill.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.880]   However, they got there on a very fickle market.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   You know, all of Facebook was based on the fact that,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.680]   you know, at the flip of a switch,
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.320]   all the cool kids ran over to Facebook
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.360]   away from MySpace.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.120]   And it seems like now that they've got the cash,
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.000]   they're diversifying and buying stuff
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.920]   with massive potential, you know,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.360]   the Oculus Rift purchase and Instagram and so on.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.800]   And it makes sense for them to do this,
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.520]   but it makes me think of seeing the breaks
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.800]   on Twitter's growth, which is really shocking to me.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.320]   And of course, you know, Wall Street, of course,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.880]   taking a giant dump on the sock.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.800]   - Snapchat is saying me a Snapchat, Chad.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.720]   - I'm gonna call you Snapchat from now on.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.600]   - Snapchat, Snapchat.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.440]   - I'm Snapchat.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.480]   - Are you Snapchatting me?
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.200]   - I'm Snapchatting actually, just to remember young,
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.360]   just 'cause--
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.120]   - 'Cause he could use the Snapchat.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.960]   - Yeah, so--
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.800]   - But yeah, I mean, the general idea is now,
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.200]   instead of clicking on a chat
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.560]   and then clicking and holding to see something,
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.480]   all of your old stuff, you can actually swipe over
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.800]   and now you're in a chat.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.880]   So if I wanted to--
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.120]   - Oh, so if I have a picture from a girl,
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.320]   I can now chat with her.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.840]   So you just like to the left.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.960]   - Right, so you just swipe, yeah, yeah, or anyone really.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.560]   My position is if you need a tutorial,
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.640]   it's too complicated, you should stop.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.200]   - Well, you know what's funny, what they did was Snapchat
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.840]   actually sent everyone a big ol' snap,
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.320]   which explaining all of the features
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.760]   and it was over in your stories and stuff like that
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.600]   to see it.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.920]   But I mean, it's interesting, I think that I saved,
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.240]   I think I saved something from maybe Scott Johnson, did I?
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.320]   - No, so what you could do is win someone,
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.360]   sends you something that you like, or I can hear,
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.880]   let me go test something and so send something to
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.440]   West Wilson, how about that?
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.960]   And I'm just gonna say, hey--
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.160]   - I already watched me, I don't need it.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.080]   (laughing)
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.320]   - And you send it, you can, if you tap on it
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.200]   and it's see how it's bold now,
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.720]   now if I move away, it's gonna save that.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.000]   So you can actually save text.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.160]   - No, it's too complicated.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   - Dude, I hate to say it, man,
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.400]   but I tuned out halfway through that.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.800]   The mere fact that I'm not paying attention is about news.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.640]   - It's too hard.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.680]   - Simplicity reigns, man, convenience over fidelity.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.440]   - So here's my new Snapchat, I put it on here
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.960]   and I use it just to see what's going on
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.040]   and then I take it off 'cause I don't want anybody to think
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.880]   that I'm using Snapchat.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.360]   - You use Snapchat?
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.920]   - Yeah, that's a problem.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.640]   Okay, now I have to log in, wait a minute,
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.280]   I'll never mind for yet.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.200]   So I'm uninstalling it again.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.800]   I think that Facebook's making a very compelling argument
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.760]   to just do one thing, well, what's app?
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.800]   Don't add a lot of features to what's app.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.760]   Instagram, they didn't change it, did they?
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.640]   But we will provide the platform across which you can
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.480]   interact, you can be in an ecosystem
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.640]   where people are gonna use you.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.960]   'Cause really these app guys, it doesn't, they don't mind,
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.560]   the only thing they want is a user base, right?
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.240]   So they can make an exit.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   - So does this make Facebook's one most valuable asset
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.760]   basically a terms of service agreement
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.560]   that allows them to share information
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.440]   and have access to their walled garden?
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.560]   I mean, is that really the biggest benefit to Facebook,
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.600]   to everyone, is that yeah, we got your login
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   and we have all of your permission and your stuff?
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.560]   - No, it's infrastructure, it's ease of use,
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.600]   it's user base, everybody wants user base.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.440]   And if you can scale, if you can get it,
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.400]   look at what's app.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.720]   - If you can get to say a 300 million users,
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.600]   you're worth 16 billion dollars.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.040]   - That's all you need?
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.080]   - Facebook wants to know your emotional connection
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.480]   to people, places and things,
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.440]   so they can filter the feed out and addict you,
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.280]   which gets you to see the advertising.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.200]   It's an easy model to figure out.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.280]   - I'm just gonna snap.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.880]   - And the fact that they're building an ecosystem
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.040]   where your ads are gonna be shoved into apps
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.480]   and shoved into other places,
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.320]   and your identity system is gonna be used all over the web,
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.360]   that just ensures that they know what you're doing
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.520]   to serve you ads.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.840]   It's not that hard to figure out what they're doing.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.760]   - Well, this takes me to a Princeton professor
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   and sociologist who decided that she did not want big data
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.240]   to see what she was up to.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   She and her husband are expecting.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.640]   And she's decided that she doesn't want big data,
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.520]   whatever big data means to know.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.680]   Talking about Janet Vritessi,
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.520]   she's an assistant professor of sociology
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.600]   at Princeton University.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.640]   She said it was the hardest thing in the world,
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.080]   but you know what, she lost her credibility right away
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.320]   with me 'cause she said,
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.840]   "I am a conscientious objector to Google,
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.960]   "but I'm still on Facebook."
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.800]   - Yeah.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   (laughs)
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.560]   - So right there I go, well, ladies--
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.400]   - They all are studying who you are.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.760]   - They do what your behaviors are to serve you better.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.640]   - She says, "I've been on Facebook about 10 years
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.800]   "since the first open to the IVs.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.200]   "I got off Google two years ago
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.000]   "when they changed their privacy policies.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.440]   "So don't use any Google products.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.080]   "I was already a conscientious objector to Google,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.800]   "but I'm very active online."
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.080]   Strike two.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.240]   - Yeah.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.920]   - I'm not fearful of that technology.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.040]   It was really an experimental thing.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.440]   What would it look to try to do it?
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.720]   What would it look like to do it
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.800]   without walking away from Facebook or Twitter?
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.960]   So the first thing they said is,
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.920]   "Okay, we're expecting, but don't tell any,
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.080]   "don't put it on, don't mention it on social media."
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.400]   She told her friends, "Don't tweet it."
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.840]   She said, "We don't put it online.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.960]   "We're doing an experiment."
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.320]   Then she said, "Whenever we searched for anything baby related,
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.480]   "we did it on tour to the privacy network,
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.800]   "so nobody would know that it was her searching."
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.640]   - Yeah.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.080]   - And then when they bought something,
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.800]   they created a fake email account on Amazon,
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.960]   and when they would buy something,
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.840]   they'd have it delivered to an Amazon locker in Manhattan,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.720]   so they didn't have her home address.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.200]   And she says, "We stocked it with Amazon gift cards
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.120]   "that we bought with cash to draw a distinction
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.280]   "between our online lives and our offline lives."
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.120]   So--
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.960]   - Keep in mind, like if she really wanted to keep it quiet,
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.360]   all she had to do was pay cash for diapers,
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.840]   add Target, right?
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.680]   - Right, right.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.520]   - Don't go on the internet.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.080]   - This is an assistant to try, yeah, exactly.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.440]   - And don't do any searches about baby stuff.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.280]   - Right.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.360]   - And don't click on any baby ads on Facebook.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.280]   - Okay, so she says it was a lot of work
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.480]   and it expected to be this hard.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.200]   There was extremely impractical, very inconvenient,
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   but I, it's, this is the thing I would say.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.920]   What have you gained by all of this effort?
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.360]   What have you gained?
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.200]   - No, baby ads.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.880]   Well, don't you want baby ads?
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.800]   - No, no, no, but basically, basically,
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.880]   the thing they're trying to compete to do,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.480]   all of these businesses and people are like,
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.640]   "Oh, privacy, I don't want corporations doing."
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.480]   Why?
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.520]   Because the corporation's goal is to beat the other guys
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.720]   of offering you precisely what you need--
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.560]   - Yes!
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.640]   - At the exact moment that you need it.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.920]   - They don't want to give you power, Moer ads.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.040]   They want to give you diaper ads.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.120]   Well, is in that what you want?
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.040]   - Exactly.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.960]   I'm with you, man.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.720]   I'm an all in guy.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.240]   There's a lot of, there is a new digital divide.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.120]   There is a new digital divide though
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.240]   between people like this who are trying to stay offline.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.920]   Richard Stallman and I had dinner and he has a button
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.320]   say, "Pay cash for everything."
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.000]   And he certainly is not on Facebook.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.320]   - Stallman, of course, the creator of the GNU project.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.160]   - Yeah.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   - One of the original MIT hackers.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.240]   - But he doesn't use credit cards
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.560]   and he doesn't use Facebook.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.400]   - Well, fine.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.240]   Good for him.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.080]   - Yeah.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.560]   - But he's had a disadvantage to people like me
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.560]   who the system does that.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.920]   - I'm just saying, what is the penalty?
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.240]   The only way you can make a penalty,
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.280]   Dvorak does this every time,
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.360]   is if you imagine some draconian scenario,
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.040]   like, I don't know,
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.320]   Google gets taken over by Adolf Hitler.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.400]   And now he's got all the data.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.760]   Or Facebook is actually a front for the CIA.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.200]   And now they've got all the--
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.320]   But what is really happening?
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.760]   All they want to do,
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.080]   didn't your baby have to get a birth certificate?
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:44.920]   - At the hospital?
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.000]   - Yeah, by the way, I went from day one,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.600]   when Henry was born 19 years ago,
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.160]   we started getting offers because of the hospital,
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.440]   immediately sell the hospital,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.600]   sells your information immediately.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.440]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.280]   - And they give you a gift basket of the money.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.960]   And then from, we keep getting,
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.440]   and right up to when he was 18,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.240]   and then the Selective Service emailed him and said,
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.880]   now you have to register for the draft.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.960]   From, for 18 years, they knew exactly,
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.880]   they kept, they followed him, we moved three times,
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.120]   they followed him, he kept getting all those mail.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:11.960]   That's what they do.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.000]   And he didn't need Google or big data to do it.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.840]   - Well, you had--
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.080]   - But I asked you again, what is the horrible amount
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.040]   of deduction on your taxes, right?
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.880]   - Yeah.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.080]   - Yeah, so he's in the system somewhere.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.000]   - I don't care.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.080]   So what?
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.000]   He asked to register for the Selective Service,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.040]   not like an avoidant.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.200]   So what is exactly the harm?
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.640]   I understand people don't want to.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.800]   And you know what, you don't have to,
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.840]   don't use the internet,
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.960]   you gotta go to a lot of trouble,
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.980]   but you can do that.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.880]   I don't understand what they're so worried about.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.240]   - I think part of the thing is we want to believe
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.200]   that we are not creatures that are that predictable.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   We don't want to believe that we are the ones that get flipped.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.040]   But we are, yeah.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.400]   And as we've said on the show before,
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.920]   it's like, you know, you exist as a feedback loop, you know?
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.640]   Who you are is what you do is determines who you are.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.000]   And if you think about it,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.640]   the ability to know your past actions
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.840]   as a predictor of what you're about to do
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.320]   is really just the concept of reputation
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.240]   as much as people get misty-eyed
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.440]   and talk about, oh, why can't it be like it used to be
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.280]   when we'd all were in small towns
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.920]   and everybody knew who everyone was.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.680]   Guess what?
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.520]   We're coming back to those days
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.600]   and it's because of technology and the internet.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.240]   I don't know that it's terrible.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.960]   I've been driving my car around.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.360]   I bought a car like what, like seven years ago
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.320]   and it's getting old
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.920]   and I've been thinking about buying a new one.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.040]   Sure enough, I don't know where a car max sends me an email
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.400]   and I'll say, like, hey, man,
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.160]   we bet your car is getting kind of old.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.040]   Have you thought about buying a new one?
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.080]   And it's like, I don't know that that's terrible.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.200]   That is exactly as evil as thinking
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.480]   to call someone on their birthday
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.360]   and say you really value their friendship.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.040]   It's a matter of--
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.400]   I understand people want to control this data, I understand.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.200]   But it doesn't help to use scary words
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.680]   like targeting you or big data.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.320]   These are kind of scary, intentionally, I think,
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.880]   scary words to make you fear something
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.160]   and I'm not sure exactly I understand the real one.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.040]   When I talk about it, I use the scary words
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.040]   because it is true.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   If you're scared of a police state,
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   there's lots to be scared of with a police state.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.040]   Yeah, when I craft the Golden Gate Bridge on the way here,
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.040]   there's a robot taking a picture of my driver's license.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.040]   So what?
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.040]   My car license plate.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.040]   What are they going to do with that?
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.040]   Well, I know where you were on Friday the third of--
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   What, who cares?
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.040]   Seriously, what is the damage?
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   What is the harm here?
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.040]   For me, nothing.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.040]   Well, I'm just wondering--
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   I'm just wondering now, and you can do things.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.040]   As Professor Vertezi pointed out,
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.040]   it's a lot of work to stay out of these days.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.040]   I just-- and I understand that people wish they could control
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.040]   their privacy, et cetera.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.040]   But I'm just not sure what the--
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.040]   You know what is--
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.040]   Here's what I--
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.040]   Here's what I--
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.040]   Here's what I think it is.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.040]   And go ahead, you know, pencil me as being off the deep end on this,
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   but I think there's a deep-seated cultural desire for us
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.040]   to not believe that, with all apologies to Padre S.J.,
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   that the Catholics were right, that there really are an all-seeing eye
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.040]   that knows all the filthy, dirty things that we do to ourselves
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.040]   when nobody's looking.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   That has been, throughout all of human history,
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.040]   been a tool used by all religions in order to enforce people
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.040]   to be good, and now it's a reality.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.040]   It's a fact that if not--
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.040]   You woke up by the way.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   --seeing you to the actual deed,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.040]   we saw all the bits that led up to it,
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.040]   and we're pretty sure, Vertezi, you know,
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.040]   it's like, "Well, we're looking at your credit card bill.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   You sure did go to the liquor store 12 times last month,
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   so I think you got a problem."
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.040]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   We don't want to believe that.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.040]   We reject that idea.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.040]   We want to believe we're captains of our own lives,
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.040]   and to know that number one, our behaviors are predictable,
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   that they're so predictable that large corporations will bank money
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.040]   on the fact that it's like, "Well, he's done ABC&D.
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   He's definitely into F."
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   And then, which, for the record, I am into F.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.040]   Fine, you got this.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.040]   [ Laughter ]
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   You're a DTF, man.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.040]   So, it's interesting that--
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   You're watching the chat room, too, because people are like,
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.040]   "Oh, why don't you put some misinformation?"
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   No, that would screw up the ads you're going to get,
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.040]   and the offer's going to set people, you know?
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.040]   And this always comes down to this.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.040]   Well, yeah, but the Amazon recommendations are so bad.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.040]   They get upset because--
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.040]   That's the whole point.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.040]   It's not working well.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.040]   [ Laughter ]
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   Yes.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.040]   Plus, Google ads is good at one thing.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   Advertising crap, I just bought.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.040]   That's the reason you're sending me these ads.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.040]   Well, that's why--
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   Although, I will say,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.040]   it's fascinating to me, like, when I wanted to surprise my wife
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.040]   on her 40th with a ski vacation,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.040]   I had to do everything in incognito mode,
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.040]   because I knew if I just searched one thing,
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   ski equipment, Utah, or whatever,
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   then every ad was going to be like,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   "Hey, man, you going on a ski vacation in Utah?"
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.040]   Okay, there's a detriment.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   You have to think in that.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   You're found a detriment.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.040]   It's hard to hide gifts.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.040]   I had a similar thing where I was doing--
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   I was making a video specifically on the most overpriced things
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   on Amazon, so I would have the idea
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   to share this stuff with people and have the links and everything.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   And one thing that I found was a $120,000 paper shredder,
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   and I just kept coming back to that,
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.040]   because I kept sharing that link with people.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.040]   And soon enough, Amazon starts asking me, like, once a week,
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   "Hey, here's a bunch of paper shredders I figured you were interested
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.040]   in buying a paper shredder."
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   Because I visited that link one or two times making that video.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   So I feel like everyone who visited the link after watching that video
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   probably got an email about,
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.040]   "Hey, here's 12 paper shredders I want to check out."
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.040]   So the algorithm's kind of heavy.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   There needs to be an irony filter, like--
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.040]   Like the end of the world, though.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   I mean, so she got off Google two years ago
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.040]   because it knew she was engaged before anybody else's.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   So what happened?
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   It meant that she sent an email to somebody on Gmail
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   and they had the word engaged,
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   and so Google showed her a jewelry store.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   And she freaked out about that, like, there's this human
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   that knows that she's--
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.040]   No, there's no human.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.040]   You know, Google knows when I'm doing things before anybody else.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   Nobody knows nothing.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   Because I put them on my freaking calendar.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   It doesn't matter because it's a--
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   I mean, it's a shame.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.040]   I'm already married, so if I'm getting a divorce,
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   the first thing I'm going to do is post my meeting with my lawyer
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.040]   onto the Google calendar.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.040]   Google's got to know what I'm doing long.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   Oh my gosh, please.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   And that's where this is.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   Now you just stepped into it, Robert.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.040]   This is why people get freaked out about it,
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.040]   because when there's algorithms, they say,
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   "Huh, you just bought a sports car, huh?
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.040]   You're working out an awful lot."
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.040]   So, okay, so you're having an affair.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   It's life-grace.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.040]   You're going to get a divorce.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.040]   Let's go ahead and just follow our lawyers.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.040]   You're more than yours.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.040]   Yeah, exactly, right?
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.040]   I mean, that's what people don't want.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.040]   That's the-- in every way, the nightmare scenario.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.040]   It's here.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.040]   [CHEERING]
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.040]   It's here.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.040]   I mean, somebody in the chat mentioned the target finding out
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   that a girl--
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.040]   That's what she was pregnant before her father did.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   Right.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   And that-- it's here.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   This is our world, you know?
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.040]   And if we don't like that world, we have to figure out how to--
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.040]   I just don't see like it's that bad.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.040]   I don't see it as that bad either.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:08.040]   And people do a lot of, well, what if the insurance companies
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.040]   then-- there's a lot of the "what ifs," but I don't see any--
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.040]   I don't see any-- that's all hypotheticals.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.040]   Well, and plus also, here's the thing.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   You can get upset about all the "what ifs" once there is no alternative.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.040]   The fact is, there's so many alternatives.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   You could use Hushmail.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.040]   You can create individual accounts.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.040]   You can create pseudonyms.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.040]   You can go through all the steps of informational hygiene
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.040]   that it takes in order to protect your information.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   And all this story shows is, yes, it's a big pain in the butt
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.040]   for very little benefit.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.040]   And we all agree, yes, that's the case, in which case--
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.040]   but the fact that we still, absolutely, from beginning to end control
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.040]   all of this tells me that I'm with you, Leo.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.040]   I don't see that it's a big deal.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.040]   And I certainly-- if it's any kind of government entity,
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   I get very, very, you know, uppity.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   But as long as the end goal of the corporations is to figure out
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.040]   how to serve me better than the other guy,
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.040]   it's really hard for me to get fired up.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.040]   Okay, Google now, that is such a benefit that comes out of them
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.040]   knowing a lot about me.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.040]   Or take it into an app like TripIt.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.040]   A TripIt knows my-- I give TripIt access to my Gmail,
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.040]   which if we had been on Leo's show 15 years ago and said,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   oh, someday we're going to give emails or third-party apps access to our email.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   I would tell you not to do it.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   And now I have, like, 15 apps that have access to my Gmail.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   It's so useful.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   I know.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.040]   It's so useful.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.040]   I was in a plane in Chicago coming home.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   We were on the tarmac, and TripIt says,
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.040]   "Your plane's being canceled.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   Buy another ticket out of town.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.040]   I click on the ticket.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.040]   I buy one that was only three seats on the next plane."
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   And then two minutes later, the pilot comes on and says,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.040]   "We're going back to the gate."
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.040]   And so I'm in an all-in world where I'm going to use all this stuff
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   and I'm going to give it as much data as possible to help my life be better.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.040]   And people like this lady are going to stay all out,
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.040]   and she's going to have to stay in Chicago.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.040]   Sorry.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:55.040]   Google, though, must acknowledge this because they just announced that they're not going
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.040]   to scan student Gmail accounts for ads anymore.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.040]   This seems to me like such a bogus story.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:09.040]   Again, this is that same magnanimousness that Facebook just showed.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.040]   Like the fact that they're only holding it to,
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.040]   you're like, "Yes, it is creepy because of students.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.040]   Totally not creepy the rest of the time."
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.040]   It's just so much noise to me.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.040]   I didn't like this story.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:24.040]   First of all, I don't see Mary Mae ads in Gmail,
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.040]   and when I do, they're in the promotion folder,
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.040]   and they're not going to turn off the promotional folder,
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.040]   so they're still scanning your email.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   They're not going to put an ad on their screen.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   They're going to scan your email if you have any email service
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   that has spam protection and scanning your email.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.040]   That's just a small district.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   They're going to go to the school district and go,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   "Hey, you want to buy Chromebooks for all your students?"
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.040]   Well, that's why they do it.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.040]   Just $250, you get everything in.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.040]   30 million students use the free Google Apps for education.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.040]   I mean, I can understand why they would do that.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.040]   Don't you think that's a...
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.040]   And they're going to hit those students who have some rails on the...
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.040]   Yeah, no, yeah.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.040]   You don't even have to hit them with ads.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   Just get them to use Google, and then when they get out of school,
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   they can get them.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.040]   That's the thing, is Occam's razor here.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:12.040]   The only reason that they would give up 30 million abilities to scrub emails
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.040]   is if, compared to the whole pie, that's an infinitesimal.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.040]   It is.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:21.040]   They feel like they're getting 30 million scrubs worth of publicity out of this.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.040]   Somebody in the chat room said it's disturbing that all of us are so on board with this stuff.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.040]   I think it's disturbing when you guys are so stuck in the mud
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.040]   and not using this stuff and saying, "Oh, I'm not going to be on Facebook."
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.040]   What are you talking about?
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.040]   There's 1.1 billion people.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   You want to email Leo and get to Leo?
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.040]   I guarantee you can't get him on email.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.040]   You can get him on Facebook.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   Don't tell him that.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.040]   [laughter]
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   And also, well, and I'm going to differ with you on this, Robert.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.040]   I'm not a get-with-the-program kind of guy.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   Just because everyone else is doing it is not a good reason for you to do it as well.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:50:00.040]   But definitely, let me know what it is you're afraid of because that's the thing that I'm...
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.040]   that I don't get, and that's what I resonated with what Leo just said.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:10.040]   My only issue is I hope we don't lose services because of this kind of moral panic about the technology.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:16.040]   And people keep, Google says, "Well, for instance, Google Glass has face recognition,
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:21.040]   but we're not going to turn it on because people would get upset by that notion."
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.040]   And yet, that would be...
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.040]   I can do face recognition without using face recognition.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.040]   Well, it's your phone is going to have a beacon at Google.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.040]   I know they're going to announce beacons for Android.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:34.040]   So all I have to do is know that I'm aiming at your phone and your phone is going to be spitting a number into the air.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.040]   Three numbers actually.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.040]   It's always hygiene that they had to go through.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   I'm standing next to Leo LaPorte on my glass without doing face recognition.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   Facebook does that right now, right?
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.040]   It knows your Facebook who's nearby.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   Yep, that's a new feature.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.040]   But they have to tread so carefully because people are so...
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   I guess what I'm saying is...
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:54.040]   Look, you have the right to privacy and I'm not denying your right to privacy.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   And if you don't like it, you shouldn't use these services.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.040]   That's fine.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.040]   I'm not going to say anything against that.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.040]   That's completely within your power.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   But what I don't want people to do, people who have this fear of technology and this kind of moral panic,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.040]   is to keep the rest of us from using things like Google now or face recognition in a glass.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   Because those would be phenomenally useful.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   And if we don't feel like there's an issue with it, now I guess you can't use face recognition because you don't have the agreement of the person you're recognizing.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.040]   You can use eye beacons because I'd have to obviously turn it on on my phone.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.040]   Yep.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.040]   So I understand that.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   Somebody in the chat room just says, "I don't see all the possible down-front sides."
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   You didn't read my book.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.040]   There's lots of downsides.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   But none of you in the chat room have said a damn thing about what's the downsides of these things.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   Tell me what the length is.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   There's a lot of hypotheticals.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.040]   I'm going to get more ads.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   Let me ask you.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.040]   You're not going to get ads no matter what.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.040]   I could promise you that.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.040]   You're just going to get better ads.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.040]   Of course you want to add better content, by the way.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:57.040]   Facebook, the news feed is learning about where you are, who you're connected to.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.040]   And it algorithmically picks things that you might be interested in.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.040]   They are trying to addict you.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   That's what they're trying to do.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:07.040]   That's the real downside is addiction, which you guys didn't mention in the chat room.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.040]   And they're very good at it.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:15.040]   They want to put things in front of you that you are going to click like on or share, comment on or share with your friends.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.040]   And they're going to try to get rid of the noise.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   And therefore you're going to get addicted to this stuff.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.040]   And addiction does have deep implications for us.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   Let me pivot this just a little bit and ask a question specifically to Marquez.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:36.040]   Because what we're talking about in general is the emergence of persistent reputations in our online interactions.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.040]   That's what seems to disturb a lot of people.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:43.040]   And we see this trend where in the early days of the internet in the late 90s, everyone could say anything.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.040]   You could post anything.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   You didn't worry about it ever coming back to bite you in the butt.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.040]   But we've seen bit by bit that window closing.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:56.040]   And most recently over the last year, we saw a shift in the way YouTube handled their comments.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.040]   Because YouTube comments used to be, I used to ask people, which would you rather do?
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.040]   Get paper cuts on your eyeballs or read YouTube comments.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.040]   And universally everyone's blind because they have so many paper cuts on their eyes.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   But then the switch to Google plus as as as clumsily as that was handled.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:16.040]   And as much of a backlash as there was, how have you seen things change in the comments on your YouTube?
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.040]   Do you find it to be more civil now that more people are using their actual name?
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.040]   Or if not, they have a persistent reputation to account for?
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.040]   Okay.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:28.040]   So depends on where you look on YouTube.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.040]   Right?
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.040]   So obviously there's, I do tech videos, some like reviewing products.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.040]   So 80% of the comments are pretty civilized for the most part.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:41.040]   So I didn't necessarily see a big change in the way people commented on my videos.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.040]   The worst thing that would happen on my videos is people screaming fanboy.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.040]   Like you did typical reviewer comments that you would see on a tech website where,
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.040]   hey, I thought this was biased blah blah, but don't pay attention to my username.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:54:00.040]   But then there's the other side of YouTube, not the other side, but there's plenty of other niches in YouTube.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   Like comedy videos, for example, like people who leave comments like, oh, this isn't funny at all.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:13.040]   Or I just hated this so much.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:17.040]   And they would just hide behind a sort of an anonymous username.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:24.040]   And the people who did that got really mad about YouTube or Google+ comments now requiring you to use your name.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.040]   And that's something I bought at a lot of people.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:32.040]   But inevitably it's just what kind of stuff do you want to be tied to your name?
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.040]   Not a big problem, not a big change. Engagement didn't really spike or decrease or anything like that.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:43.040]   But I feel like I know there are parts of YouTube where people would be more tempted to leave more ridiculous comments
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.040]   or comments they wouldn't want to be associated with themselves.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:52.040]   They saw differences in maybe comedy videos or other genres that I'm not really as.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:57.040]   Well, and what's interesting is I know I read an article recently about the plight of girl gamers
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:03.040]   who get a lot of sexist hateful comments in their inbox after gaming sessions for Call of Duty or whatever.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   And it makes me wonder like what kind of comments are the ones that number one would be legitimate helpful comments
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.040]   that number two you wouldn't want associated with your name.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.040]   How often does that happen? Can you think of an example of that?
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:24.040]   Just in the tech videos I see people who are like, you know, trying to, half of them are people who are not making videos
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:29.040]   and they don't want people to know that they're just bashing on everything that they hate
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   so they can just feel free to lash out at anyone they want, take out any negative thoughts they want to have
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   and just put them wherever they want and no one will know it's them.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   So if you don't have that anonymity then you're not going to do that anymore.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.040]   You don't want that tied to your name forever because that's your Google account and you can't hide that.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:52.040]   I mean, I could think of a scenario. What if you work for Samsung
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:58.040]   and you wanted to say to Marquez, yeah, we really got a problem with this piece of hardware.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:03.040]   You're not going to do it. But that's a, I mean, so what? That's a minor loss.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:07.040]   Plus also there's an ecosystem for that, right? You've got stuff like what...
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.040]   That's always the secret app or whatever.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:17.040]   Yeah, secret. That's always the exception that people point out whistle blowers and the like Edward Snowden.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:23.040]   People who would like to speak truth to power but can't safely do it.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:27.040]   In this country it's a lot safer than it is in a lot of other countries.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.040]   So I understand there's a need for anonymity.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   But boy, the internet comments, chat rooms, places like that.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.040]   We allow people to use handles and chat rooms in our chat room.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:44.040]   I don't know. Maybe if you think if we made them use their real name, we'd have fewer troll problems.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:48.040]   Well, you see, I don't care what you call yourself as long as you keep calling yourself the same thing.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.040]   Well, but that's the point. You can hide behind a hand.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.040]   Yeah, sure. And there ain't nothing wrong with that. That's cool.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.040]   [laughter]
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   I do feel bad. If I were a female YouTuber, I would be very happy about this change.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:06.040]   YouTube comments were pretty horrendous for a long time.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   Well, and plus also think about this. If what we want is the web to be a legitimate place for business,
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   where real deals are secured and real losses.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   That's why Google and Facebook do it because they want real identity.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   Exactly.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   But that's for a commercial reason. I mean, there are reasons.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   And we're not the customer. We're the product. Right?
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:30.040]   Yeah, that's another example of things that people say, if you're not, you know,
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.040]   I'm paying for it. You're the product.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.040]   That's negative. We don't pay Facebook for anything.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   Everybody watches. You could say about Twitter that everybody watches Twitter is the product.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.040]   But that's the way that's sort of true.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   Yeah, but my point is that is a very simplifying kind of thing to say.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   I mean, it's not untrue, I guess. But that doesn't say the whole story, right?
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.040]   We do do it because we are interested in talking about this stuff because we want to give people this information.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:06.040]   We feel very strongly. The real truth about it is it's ad supported because that seemed to be the best way
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   to make it available to the widest possible audience.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   But if you say, and it isn't exactly untrue to say, well, if you didn't pay for Twitter, you're the product,
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   no, that's true. The reason we can make money, it's doing ads, is because people watch.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:24.040]   So your attention is of value to us. But it's not the only reason we do this.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:28.040]   It's not of... Right. And so that implies that people don't have the good content.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.040]   Nobody watches it.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   Well, it implies that you don't have advertising. Mark Zuckerberg did Facebook because he just wanted to use people
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   and make money off of them. Or we do Twitter just because we want to use people and make money.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:43.040]   And that's not the reason we do Twitter. And I'm going to give Mark some credit and assume that's not the reason he does Facebook.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:48.040]   So it's a very... I don't like that. I mean, I've said it and I've used it, but I don't like that idea
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   because I think it's oversimplifying the truth of it.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:56.040]   Yeah, I totally agree with this. And this is the problem that we have with Robert Barron's of all varieties,
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   is that it's easy to overstate like, well, they're getting rich.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   Therefore, they must be screwing us in some way. But in every single case, the way they're getting rich is by offering something cheaper, faster, better.
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:10.040]   That is of value to so many people that they make it happen. And even now...
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.040]   That's a very good point, actually.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:18.040]   I mean, that's... I mean, to be honest, that's part of the reason that we resent them is because they make it look so easy or whatever.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:25.040]   But I suspect that what is happening in general is only empowering more individuals.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:29.040]   And yes, it is weird to watch somebody profit obscenely.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:36.040]   And I think it's fine to say I've seen about a money, as I understand money, for it, for what seems like it should be obvious.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:41.040]   But all the greatest, all the most important discoveries always seem obvious in retrospect.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:44.040]   And they always seem like, well, why did that person deserve to make all that money?
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:49.040]   Because it turns out that there is a value to limiting interactions to only 140 characters.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   And for that, Twitter deserved to make a bajillionty dollars.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.040]   By the way, they're not making as bajillionty dollars as they used to.
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.040]   Oh my gosh. Yeah, no, we should talk about this.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.040]   In fact, we just made more money on Twitter than Twitter did in the same amount of time.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.040]   [laughter]
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.040]   Just want to point that out.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.040]   If you actually, wouldn't that be a great thing?
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.040]   Who makes the most money? Twitter or Twitter?
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   Twitter makes very little money, right?
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   They lost money last quarter.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.040]   Although, you know, I'm watching... What was I watching?
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.040]   What were you watching?
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.040]   Oh, Jimmy Fallon.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.040]   It's not late now anymore.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   It's a nice show.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.040]   And they use Twitter very effectively.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.040]   They use hashtags.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.040]   They do it like crazy.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:38.040]   And I imagine that that's good for their ratings, that there is promotion.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:42.040]   You know, he had a lip sync contest with Emma Stone.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.040]   And I saw a lot of social media action around it.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.040]   Lots of views on YouTube.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.040]   Lots of tweets about it.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.040]   That's probably good for their ratings, I would guess, and certainly makes it a more valuable show.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.040]   But Twitter is not seeming to see too much about it.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.040]   And as a result, the Twitter stock is sinking.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.040]   You know, I don't know if the stock market is a way to judge a company.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   No, in fact, I go nuts when we talk about stock, because all stock is, you know, an expectation put to numbers.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.040]   But however I will say...
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   But it does point a problem, which is that the growth is slowed.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   It's still growing.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   Yes.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.040]   So you got to be very clear.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.040]   It's still growing.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.040]   It's just not growing as fast.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.040]   Well, yeah.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.040]   The problem is Facebook has 1.1 billion people.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040]   Twitter has what?
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040]   $300 billion?
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040]   $255 million active users.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040]   A quarter of that.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:35.040]   And so Twitter should be growing faster than Facebook because they have more open ground to grow.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.040]   And they're not.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:44.040]   And that tells you something about how strong Facebook is, because Facebook has your real social graph, your friends.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.040]   Right.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:52.040]   And the connections to your friends are more emotional to most people, not some of you in the chat room,
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:02:00.040]   but to most people, a baby photo from my real family or friends is much more interesting to me than some news people.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   But Facebook doesn't seem to be doing that in their newsfeed.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.040]   They want to be a news source.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.040]   No, no, no.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   I don't see my friends post.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040]   Oh, I do all the time.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040]   Oh, I see some, but I don't see all.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   You don't see...
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.040]   I guarantee you, Robert, you do not see all of your friends post.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.040]   What I've done is put my family on the list so I can see all of your family.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.040]   Oh, you've worked a way around it.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040]   But most people don't do that.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040]   You go to your newsfeed.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.040]   No, but look at all the crap my family posts.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   And Facebook has decided that the newsfeed should be news, not my friends.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:36.040]   I guarantee you, if there's a baby that was born in your social graph, you're going to see that photo because Facebook is actually pretty good at putting good stuff up on your feed.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   Mostly my friends are dying, not having a face.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.040]   That's a whole other problem.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040]   That's a problem.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   We'll have to have a Twitter.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.040]   Pretty soon it'll be obituaries.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.040]   It starts with weddings, then babies, then the obituaries.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:58.040]   No, I mostly see like 15 forgotten movies you should watch, you know, 22 celebrities that look nothing alike.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.040]   That's what I see in my Facebook feed.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.040]   I would like to see some babies.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.040]   Some weddings.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.040]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.040]   We're going to really kill the subject there.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.040]   You want to see a dog in a cat dancing to happy by Pharrell?
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.040]   Heck yeah.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.040]   All right.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.040]   That's in my Facebook feed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.040]   Happy dogs and a cat in Australia.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:32.040]   And while we're watching this, this is going to get us pulled from YouTube for no reason.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.040]   Because this is stupid.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:39.040]   Well, then by all means, let's talk about an important sponsor instead.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:44.040]   Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I show today brought to you by friends at Citrix who do go to
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.040]   meeting with HD faces.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.040]   I know businesses because you know nowadays businesses are spread all out teams are in different
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.040]   locations, clients and even colleagues are, you know, across the globe.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.040]   Go to meeting, let's you stay together, stay in touch.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.040]   And I, you know, we're still humans.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040]   Face to face is still number one.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.040]   You got to see somebody face to face.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.040]   Go to meeting started by allowing you to share your screen so you could stay on the same page,
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.040]   literally see the documents, collaborate on the documents, you know, give you a PowerPoint.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.040]   But adding this HD faces now, this makes it like really like you're in person.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.040]   And I know teams who are distributed all over the world who keep go to meeting running all day.
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.040]   Because you pay one low flat monthly rate for as long as you want for as many meetings as you want.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.040]   So just keep it on all day.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040]   And they're working together.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   They're collaborating.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   It's great.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.040]   Anytime we do a conference call, sure we could just do the conference bridge.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   But I use go to meeting in case we want to tune on the video or we want to show a document.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   It's just it's really helpful to have go to meeting with HD faces from Citrix.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:51.040]   It is the powerfully simple way to meet in person online anywhere, anytime to brainstorm,
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:58.040]   to develop quality ideas, to solve, to cut the Gordian, not to just solve problems.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.040]   When you get elected to lieutenant governor, I want you to bring this to the state house
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:07.040]   and say, everybody, tell the assembly, we got to meet online.

[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.040]   I hope politicians start making this a place to come for your campaign.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040]   You could come on here.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.040]   You could talk.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040]   I think that's great.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:31.040]   I'm a candidate for California state lieutenant governor in studios we could tell because he's
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.040]   well dressed and the rest of you look like slobs.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.040]   No, you all look good.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.040]   But I think that's cool.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040]   I think that's cool.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:44.040]   I wonder, do you think politicians need to use social media, Facebook and Twitter effectively?
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.040]   Don't you think?
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040]   That's important.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.040]   Now, Robert, you're looking at your Facebook.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.040]   Now, what is that?
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.040]   A baby picture?
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.040]   No.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.040]   It's some stupid poster.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.040]   That's something friends said.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.040]   Tagged me in.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.040]   How about a cat video?
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.040]   I'll find a cat video.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.040]   I got one.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.040]   This is a cat dancing.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.560]   I feel like I failed the show just now because I ran to go to the bathroom and grab a soda
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.040]   and I come back just in time to hear how about a cat video and I feel like I failed you.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.040]   You couldn't have any amount of time.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.040]   Isn't that what you're known for is cat videos, Brian?
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.040]   Brian cat video brush.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.040]   That's what they say.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.040]   Don't have schwood on.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.040]   They'll bring his cat videos again.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.400]   I found a baby dancing video, but not a cat video.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.040]   Cat videos are hard to find on my feed because I keep hiding them.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.040]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.600]   Is Facebook here those signals?
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.360]   Facebook learns from what you do.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:38.040]   If you hide certain kinds of posts, you're not going to see them as often.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040]   All right.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   Nice of them to listen.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:46.240]   I mean, that's what people are freaking out about is the fact that a service provider
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.760]   listens and strives to provide exceptional service.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.160]   And yes, I know there's a million ways it could be abused before you guys send me emails
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.480]   and messages on it.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.640]   But so far, like we haven't seen those.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:02.120]   We haven't seen anybody totally victimized by big data manipulating them.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.040]   Instead, people are outraged like, ah, I got a coupon.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.040]   That's really useful.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.120]   That's exactly what I wanted today.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.920]   I found a cat video for you.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   A cat is joking.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   I was joking.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.920]   There's nothing that's going to stop me guys from looking at a goddamn cat video.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.720]   I don't want to see a cat hates the singing cat birthday card.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.760]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   Come on.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760]   It's entertainment.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.560]   A new MacBook is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.800]   And here's an interesting story.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.080]   It's $100 less has a faster processor.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:40.040]   But according to a benchmarks, it's got a way slow hard.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:44.840]   So I don't know if Apple's trying to save money by putting a much slower SSD in there,
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.440]   but it's like one.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.640]   It was one third as fast as last year's 11 inch MacBook Air for unzipping files.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.280]   That's painful.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.880]   That's not good.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   So just a word of warning.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.760]   Well, and this is difficult too, because if you're going to make your bones by having
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:07.320]   exquisitely fine hardware, you need to keep doing that because your reputation is going
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.720]   to get better every time.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.440]   It's now it's a shock when something gets worse.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.880]   I know it's a hundred bucks less.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.880]   But when it gets so much.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.320]   But again, but this is a case like think about it when they launched MacBook Air.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.120]   MacBook Air meant one thing.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   So thin.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.120]   It was like magic.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.720]   Like like it was the highest end of the high end.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.760]   And we all enjoyed reading stories of rich assholes throwing them away in the trash because
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.360]   they couldn't even know that they were there.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.960]   But wasn't that you?
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.440]   No, I wish.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:37.000]   Oh, no, it was clay Morris.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.160]   It was somebody though.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.760]   The MacBook Air just means the entry level base, whatever.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.280]   And it's I don't know, that's a real bummer to see that value of that brand drop.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.880]   But what it shows you is interesting because I mean, 899 is not a cheap computer by any
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.000]   regard, but it seems cheap from Apple, right?
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.200]   Wow, it's the lowest cost computer, except for the mini, but it's a cheap laptop.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.200]   The make.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:07.240]   So how 899, but you would but really in truth in the in the normal world, 899 is a fairly
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.320]   pricey computer and you don't expect a drop in performance.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.480]   So just a word of warning, I guess.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.720]   But if you're a student and you get told, right, you should get a you should get a MacBook,
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.720]   right, then you look up.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.160]   That's the one that's the one I can get.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.160]   That's going to be the one.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.760]   In fact, I think a lot of it, you know, I mentioned this when it when it was announced
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.720]   earlier this week, the high school that I can sell for stopped buying MacBooks because
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.680]   they didn't have anything low price stuff.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.680]   That's a one to one program.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.760]   So everybody going to the school gets a laptop.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.240]   They they use Lenovo.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.120]   There's Lenovo for education.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   Windows laptops are giving kids.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120]   They're not going to.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.120]   It just hurt me.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.640]   Well, you know, it seems like Chromebook is the right thing to do.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:51.200]   Yeah, frankly, most of the schools that I talked to are 21% now in schools is Chromebooks
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.440]   of holy cow.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.480]   You know, my daughter is in fourth grade and already they've they've centered everything
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.480]   on the the Google environment.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.760]   So she's got her Google ID uses Google Docs.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.760]   I just walked in.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.840]   She was writing a paper in Google Drive.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840]   It is.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.800]   It's a very smart move and it's a good.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.120]   We've talked about this before.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.080]   You know, we've talked about the movement to doing everything in the cloud seems dumb
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.960]   because what happens when there's no cloud?
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   Like those days are gone.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.800]   There's never going to be a day where there's no cloud.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.720]   It's like like having no cloud in 10 years will be as weird as the power going out.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.720]   Do you remember?
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:29.960]   Do you remember just like 30 years ago, who's not at all told for the power to go out?
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:35.640]   One minute and 20 seconds of my life every day is cloudless when I go through the tunnel.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.040]   You should pay.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.880]   You know what my friend pay attention to the road.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.080]   Stop tweeting in the tunnel.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080]   And I cashed all my Spotify.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.080]   Did you know that too?
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.360]   You can go to the right settings and cash all your Spotify.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.360]   I use Google Music.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360]   Same thing.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.360]   You pin it.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.440]   Can we talk about the only way this will go bad is if I don't know something where to
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440]   violate net neutrality.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.800]   Can we talk about this whole FCC situation?
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.040]   Yeah, we can talk about it.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.080]   We absolutely by the way, it was David Pogue who accidentally threw out his MacBook
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.080]   Air because it was so thin.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:06.120]   It was a stack of papers and threw it away.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.840]   Well, I take it back when I said, "A-hole," I meant delightful individual life.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.840]   That's the fault that I meant.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.680]   Singing fool, David Pogue.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.320]   This is actually a little bit of an old story.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.880]   We talked about it last week on Twitter.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.120]   I certainly don't mind bringing it up again because it ain't over till the FAT commissioner
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.600]   sings.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:32.440]   Tom Wheeler, who is a tame lobbyist for the National Cable Television Association, former
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.120]   president there, and the wireless industries.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.240]   He's in both halls of fame.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.720]   So he really gets around.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.600]   He's also oddly enough.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.480]   The chairman of the government group that's supposed to regulate these industries, I don't
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.360]   know how that could possibly.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.840]   That doesn't, seems like that would be a problem.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.880]   He's the chairman of the FCC and he's proposed new FCC rules, none of which we have seen.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:59.720]   Denise Hal pointed this out last week and apparently they still have, we still have
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.320]   not seen these.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.640]   The commissioners will be voting, I think, next week on these and then they'll be up
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   for comment.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:11.520]   They're saying, "Hey, you know what, this whole open Internet thing, it's nice, but the
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.840]   Telecommunications Act doesn't really allow us to do that.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.200]   So here's what we're going to do."
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.160]   Since the law says we can't regulate this, we're going to just stop.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:29.080]   And if you are an Internet service provider and you want to charge an edge provider like
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:34.520]   Twit or YouTube or Netscape to get to your customers, you go right ahead and do that.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.200]   Now, of course, that's really in violation of everything we hold near and dear.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:43.280]   And as Senator Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts tweeted, she said, "I don't think we know
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.080]   what the next big thing is going to be in the United States, but one thing we could
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.520]   be pretty sure of, it's going to be online and that startup isn't going to have the kind
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.640]   of money that a YouTube or it gives companies like Netflix and YouTube the power to pull
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.640]   up the ladder."
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.640]   Well, okay.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:03.040]   So, but before you say your thing and I'm going to let you, I will give you something
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:10.560]   you can do about it, the FCC has opened a mailbox for comment, open internet@fcc.gov.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.760]   So whether you love this or you hate it, you can let them know how you feel about it.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.920]   You know how I feel about it.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.920]   Go ahead.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:18.920]   Brian Brushwood.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.320]   Well, I am very conflicted over this whole thing.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.320]   And I honestly don't know.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:26.320]   I'm going to play the dumb card on this because on the one hand, you know, we're hearing so
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.360]   many of the right words come out of Wheeler.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360]   That's his name, right?
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.600]   Ralph, talking about the importance of competition and of doubling down, making sure everyone
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.600]   has access.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.080]   These are all things that we want to hear.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.520]   But then in the same breath, he's like, also, we should have a fast lane available for people
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.800]   who feel like paying with it, which makes me cringe.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.040]   But then I think about the whole breakdown of the peering agreements with Netflix.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.520]   Netflix in peak hours takes up a third of all internet traffic.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.920]   Netflix wants to work out a deal.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.920]   Okay.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.200]   I understand your concern and this you're confusing to issues.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.200]   Right.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.440]   And Netflix pays currently for peering.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.720]   And this is not what we're talking about.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.120]   That's different.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.720]   So Netflix and there is a big argument there.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.560]   God knows Netflix is not happy.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.800]   The fact Verizon is now saying, and by the way, you can give us some money too, but you
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.040]   could make the argument they are using a lot of bandwidth.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.600]   So maybe they should be paying for peering because it's not a symmetric relationship.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.040]   It's not what we're talking about.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.040]   What Wheeler's proposed rules would do is let edge providers.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:30.840]   It means everybody who provides content, Twit, you, Brian, everybody can now pay for improved
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.400]   access.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.320]   That's a different thing.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.640]   That's not a peering relationship.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.720]   That's just that means the cable companies and the phone companies.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.920]   Now why TT is already doing it with what do they call it?
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:51.000]   They allow a company to pay them so that it won't count against your bandwidth cap.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.960]   So that's the same thing.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960]   So they're already doing it.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:59.120]   Comcast will absolutely do this if these rules go through.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120]   That's different.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:03.920]   That's them going to each edge provider, each content creator and saying, oh, by the way,
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.560]   you have to pay us too.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:12.160]   Now this surprises me that you're so universally against it as the stated goal is to preserve.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.000]   Well, because let's say, let's say we didn't know that we were talking about the internet.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.360]   If I said there's a thing and the guy regulating the thing wants to regulate it to preserve
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.600]   competition and wants to know that he's lying.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.160]   No, no, no, you're buying your buying into wheelers.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.280]   You're buying into Wheeler's big lie.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.880]   The first thing he does is publish a blog post say, pay no attention.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.400]   This is no change in rules.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.600]   No, no, no, no.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.760]   It's all fine.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.160]   And enough people bought this.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.360]   I was shocked.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.680]   Companies like CNET published articles saying, oh, it's okay.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680]   But it's not.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.880]   It is a very big change in rules.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.880]   So don't get fooled by the big lie.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.160]   And remember who pays Tom Wheeler.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   It ain't.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:16:01.040]   It's a revolving door at the FCC and he will go right back to industry.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:06.960]   The current chairman of the National Cable Television Association is Michael Powell, the
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.600]   former chairman of the FCC.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.600]   It's a revolving door.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.920]   These guys are going to go right back in industry and they will be very much rewarded
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.120]   for changing the rules.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:22.880]   And if I'm at a cable company right now, I am scared to death because we are so close
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:29.240]   to getting what we need on internet connected devices to get rid of all of our cable.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.480]   We now are getting sports.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.320]   We are now getting good enough news.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.040]   And so what's left?
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040]   And we're getting-
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   Oh, you know what they do.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.040]   They raise-
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.040]   We're getting content.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.240]   We're getting custom content, right?
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:46.800]   The house of cards and Amazon has a series of shows, right, that they paid for.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.640]   So we're getting custom content on the internet.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.640]   We're getting the sports.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.480]   The cable companies are not stupid.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:55.600]   So what they're doing is they're raising the cost of internet alone to match the cost
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.280]   of cable plus internet.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.960]   They get you in the fold.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.800]   They've been very careful about doing that.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:01.800]   And if they can charge Netflix-
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.880]   Well, of course also, nowadays you can actually pay less for your cable if you accept-
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.520]   I'm sorry, you can pay less for your internet if you accept basic cable as well.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.000]   I mean, they are so concerned about maintaining this fig leaf that everything's fire.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   I'm not naive.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   The chat room is really-
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   Oh, don't pay attention to the-
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   Don't pay attention to the-
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   No, no, that's just some guy.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   That's not the audience.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   That's just some guy.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   Don't pay any attention.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   Don't worry about it.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   I'm not naive.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.640]   Why do you look at the Work Card and Internet hosting company?
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640]   Come on, I know who owns the-
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.360]   Oh, you are naive.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.040]   You think that there's still fairies in unicorns.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   I know.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040]   I do.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.800]   Well, I'll tell you this much.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.360]   As far as the net neutrality thing- and this goes all the way back to what?
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.240]   Three, four years ago, Leo, when I first came on the show, my hope is that- and it's not
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.040]   just my hope, it's the EFFs as well.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.760]   If you read the EFF stuff, they say stuff like, yes, it's important that we have universal
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.400]   access and that everyone get in.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.720]   No, we're not crazy about the idea of government being the one to make sure that that happens.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:02.360]   You know, I want to believe that net neutrality will remain this electrified third rail-
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360]   When you're a free market nutball-
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.520]   That nobody dare touch.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.600]   You're a free market nutball.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.120]   You believe that if there is true competition- and you're right, by the way- if there's true
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:14.920]   competition among- in other words, if I had a choice of 10 and a service providers, this
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:15.920]   would all work out.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.120]   You're right, but you don't, do you?
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.200]   And who was it that set that up?
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.200]   I mean, yes.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.440]   The FCC created duopoly.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.600]   At best, you have two choices in this country.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.600]   So there is no competition.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.600]   No, that's not even true.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.240]   So the government created the problem to begin with.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.480]   I'm not going to say that Austin is representative of everyone, but I will say that-
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.480]   Well, you have Google fiber, but that's-
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.000]   What's funny is I don't.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.200]   I'm six miles outside of the Austin city limits, which means I don't have Google fiber, and
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.400]   plus also Google fiber isn't even installed, but just the threat of Google fiber caused
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.480]   AT&T to come in and offer a gigabit service outside of Austin.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.360]   So they preemptively competed, which means I have, you know, AT&T Uverse.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.640]   I have, you know, Clear.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.960]   I have Time Warner cable.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.360]   I've got Direct PC.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.440]   I can even use as many people do.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.680]   We're seeing a lot of people not cutting the cable cord, but cutting their internet
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.080]   cord as they instead use their mobile devices.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.760]   So I can use AT&T wireless.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.680]   And again, this is not ideal and it's not as fast as we'd like.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.880]   But the fact is I have more choices than ever before.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.960]   Who are the companies you could choose internet from?
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.360]   Like I just said, there's your cable company and there's your phone company.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.360]   There's two competing cable companies.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.600]   Well, you have two cable companies.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.600]   That's very unusual.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.600]   That's correct.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.960]   There's two regions in the area.
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.960]   So you do have, you would do a phone company.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.440]   There's phone companies if I wanted DSL.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.440]   There's also satellite.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.640]   Wait, wait, you have more than one phone company?
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.640]   Yes.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.640]   Well, no, no, no.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.760]   I mean, what I'm saying is if what I want is data service, my total list, and this is
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.920]   just off the top of my head.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.400]   Forgive me if it's not all inclusive, we had Clear here in Austin.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.440]   We have Direct PC, which is the satellite.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:58.160]   We have AT&T wireless and of course Verizon wireless, all the wireless providers and their
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.840]   plans are much, much better now.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.640]   Right now we're on a shared 10 gigabyte plan for the family.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.960]   There's also two cable companies competing.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.720]   One of them fiber optic that this is what I'm on right now is the 300 megabit up and
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.880]   down.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:15.360]   And then on top of that, there's also for the fringes because there's a lot of rural
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.600]   areas outside.
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:20.080]   They have individual radio based services as well.
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.720]   So again, none of this is ideal and sure, if I wanted, if I could have more, I would
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:24.720]   have more.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.120]   What are the caps on the wireless that you have?
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.120]   My wireless like for AT&T.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:35.320]   I just say curiosity, your direct TV, your wireless caps, they are very low.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   Yes.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.320]   No, no, no.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.320]   You're not userbly high.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.320]   Absolutely.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.320]   Absolutely.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.320]   I don't think so.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.320]   Really?
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.120]   And you have an unusually good situation and it's still not that good.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:49.920]   Well, it's not as good as we'd like, but if you came to me 20 years ago and told me this
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.680]   is the future, I'd pee my pants, man.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:57.800]   I'd be a, you're talking to a guy who paid $150 a month for crappy satellite service
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:03.000]   that I set up in my apartment on two cinder blocks to just get this signal so I could
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.320]   get four times DSL.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:08.200]   I mean, the fact is it's undisputable that is getting better.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.200]   And yes, we all want to keep that.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.200]   I just wonder, okay.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.480]   So let's say that this goes through.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:16.560]   Do you think, see, you're not a situation, a much more typical situation here.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.440]   We have Comcast and we have DSL and the DSL will ride on AT&T's wires, but it might be
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.440]   a third party.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.760]   The DSL is too slow unless you're within two kilometers of the central office.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.240]   So I have Comcast.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:33.120]   Do you think if this goes through the Comcast will then give me tiered service?
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.200]   We'll say you want the bronze plan.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:42.400]   You can have access to my space, Yahoo and dig or you can have the silver plan.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:49.160]   We'll give you access to YouTube and Vivo and, you know, this is, this is why I'm not
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.520]   afraid of this is because the mere fact that you use this as an example, this is universally
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.160]   the nightmare scenario that everybody derides laughs at and says screw the whole system
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.680]   if this is what they offer us.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.800]   The mere fact that you can offer that knowing.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.720]   What would I do about it?
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.960]   To be honest, it's that what I do.
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.000]   What you would do is what it was because most people in that situation, what is your choice
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.680]   then?
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.800]   The answer is it's not about what you would do.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.640]   It's about what the entrepreneurial spirited competitor would do.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:23.960]   And they would recognize that nobody wants this and they would come into that area because
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.800]   they would see a tremendous market opportunity.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.360]   Why have they done that already?
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.040]   Isn't there an opportunity now?
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.440]   Well because nobody, because you just offered up a straw man that nobody's offering.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.080]   Nobody's offering this bronze silver service or whatever.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:40.840]   Well, I find you to be a little more careful than you are Brian Brushwood because if all
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:49.600]   of a sudden the providers who provide your stream for your show don't pay the fee.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.680]   And you can't, you get buffered to 90% of the United States.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.960]   How are you going to feel about that?
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.000]   Is that going to foster your business?
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.120]   Well, no, I certainly wouldn't like it.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.680]   And I would immediately hold up a fist full of cash and say, who can offer me not this?
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.680]   And that's what I'm hoping everyone would do.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.840]   No, no, no, because you're an edge provider.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.080]   You don't get a choice.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.080]   You don't get a choice.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.920]   You have to pay, you don't want a fist full of cash to who?
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.040]   To somebody who's going to give you point to point access to your customers.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.280]   You don't get a choice.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.280]   You're a provider.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:23.720]   I mean, again, all what I'm saying is that I have more choices than I've ever had before.
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.040]   You're talking about it as the end user.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:30.480]   I'm just pointing out that you should be worried as a content creator, even more than
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.800]   the end user.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:36.000]   Let's say you're right that somebody's going to march in and trench out to my house and
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.280]   give me in high speed internet.
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.280]   It ain't going to happen.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.040]   But let's say it's right.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.920]   This still doesn't solve your problem, Brian Brushwood, because you have to pay Comcast
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:50.640]   and AT&T and Verizon for access to their customers, or you're going to be buffering.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.880]   And you're not going to have a stream.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   So you can, I guess you can offer that.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:57.960]   I don't believe, I mean, yes, in your fantasy, that would be terrible and I would be against
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.960]   it.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960]   I also don't believe it's going to happen.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.360]   I believe that it would be suicide because it would be suicide for anyone to do this.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:08.840]   The mere fact that you're afraid of this scenario that not one person in the entire world would
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:09.840]   vote for.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840]   There's no-
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840]   There's no-
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840]   There's no-
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.840]   There's no-
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.840]   There's no precedent for it to go down the way you're describing.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.320]   And I don't believe it's going to happen.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.320]   There is a precedent.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.480]   I think that you try using Skype in Canada where Rogers after 15 minutes will disconnect
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.480]   you.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.480]   There is a precedent.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.880]   Is that the service provider?
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.880]   They use sand.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.840]   I can't remember the name of a sand vine.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.400]   How's that working out for them?
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.400]   Are they really excited?
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.400]   People complain about it.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.880]   People complain about it.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.920]   But Rogers tell, you know, as a result, Rogers VoIP does quite well.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   Watch.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.800]   Well, I mean, again, short term.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.040]   Short term benefit, long term, very foolish maneuver.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.240]   I don't think it's going to work out for them for the long term.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.240]   I don't feel right.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.240]   In general.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.240]   I mean, I-
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.600]   I understand your great fear is government regulation of the internet.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   I understand that.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.600]   Well, it's not even my great fear.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.400]   It's not- I don't even hate it.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:06.680]   I just think it's a- it's an unfortunately imprecise instrument to be used.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:12.600]   And all things being equal, I would rather the highly precise forces of market demand
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.400]   determine it and not the lazy bureaucratic hand of government.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.160]   I agree with you 100%.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.080]   I just don't feel like that's going to happen.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.280]   I'm more optimistic than you.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.840]   But that's that's always been our dynamic.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.240]   I mean, it would always be the case if market forces could operate freely in this case,
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.960]   but we know they can't.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.280]   It's highly regulated.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.280]   These are monopolies.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.680]   They are government and franchise monopolies.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.560]   So already you don't have a competition in the middle of the situation.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.160]   You're very lucky and I don't think you have a very competitive situation that even in
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160]   Austin.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:50.760]   Well, again, in general, my default position is always more competition, 100% across the
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:51.760]   board.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:56.360]   Even in my, you know, even in my, you know, swimming in soup situation here in Austin.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.360]   But, but I guess I'm not a-
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   That is super pretty good.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.160]   I have that.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.000]   The mere fact that every time this subject brings up, everybody goes up in arms.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.240]   I love it, dude.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:10.500]   Everybody pull out the pitchforks all the time because that's really what concerns
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.500]   all these guys.
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.220]   They're not where you think these guys are worried about government regulation.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:16.400]   These guys buy government officers all the time.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.800]   That's kind of a point, isn't it?
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   Exactly.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:23.360]   It's like the last thing I want is a entity that has a reputation for being easily to
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.440]   be easily profitable, easy to buy off.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.440]   The reason we get in charge of it.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:33.020]   Up in arms is because this, the system that we have as of today brought us all sorts of
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:40.040]   innovation in this country and a whole lot of startups that are employing people.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.880]   And those startups happen because it was a fair playing field and everybody could afford
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.600]   the entry fee to it.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   We were hoping to get-
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.320]   We were heading toward a world where if you have the money, you can pay for it.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.280]   But that means a small startup like Instagram when I met them was two people at a little
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.160]   picnic table.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:05.260]   And so is that startup going to have the same kind of access to the customer base they have
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.260]   today?
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.260]   I don't know.
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.580]   I mean, the answer is yes, they did.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.060]   And it turned out great for them.
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.060]   I mean, they did.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:18.500]   But the rules are changing now so that to get access to the Verizon customers or to the
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.740]   Comcast customers, you have to pay.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:28.980]   That means a whole lot of little 19 year old run companies that do not have the capital
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.120]   yet are going to be locked out.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.240]   I mean, and so we need government to hold their hands and make sure-
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.240]   No, it's government.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.240]   Government.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.240]   Government.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.240]   We can stop.
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.240]   We can stop.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.240]   We get everybody's point.
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.240]   The positions are now clear.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.240]   And let's, except for Marques, who's just sitting on the sidelines thinking, "God, I don't
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.520]   have to say anything."
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520]   Come on, Marques.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.020]   You want to pitch in at all?
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:53.100]   When you're remote, by the way, Marques, it's really hard to jump in.
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:54.100]   I know where-
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.100]   Just jump in.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.380]   I just wrote a paper.
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:01.820]   I had to write a collaborative paper on net neutrality for a final project.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:05.140]   So my brain is just kind of all worn out about it now.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:08.920]   I had to write like a sort of a PSA, like a public service announcement, giving like
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:14.820]   all the potential pros and cons for Internet users and service providers and blah blah
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:15.820]   blah.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.820]   So I've heard all the sides already.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:22.220]   Basically, I've read all the sides and I'm just-
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.020]   So where do you stand?
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:26.060]   What was the thesis of your paper?
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.980]   My thesis was that you should care.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:33.220]   And if it goes to the extreme and if legislation becomes really prominent, then you should really
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.180]   care and then vote with your wallet.
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:39.660]   But the whole point of the paper was to not take a side and be as neutral as possible
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:47.020]   and just inform the people reading it that the problems could potentially exist.
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:48.020]   I think it comes down.
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.940]   I mean, we don't need to go anymore because I think everybody understands everybody's
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:51.940]   point of view in here.
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:57.820]   But it does come down to how much you've believed that there is a free market in the
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:58.820]   United States.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.380]   I find it hard to believe that you think that there is.
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:03.380]   Maybe you think that there will be if there were-
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.380]   Let me go to this way.
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:08.220]   Whether there is, whether there is, and I guarantee you, there won't be more after a
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.020]   government comes in and sets the rules.
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:11.020]   You might be right.
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.020]   Absolutely.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.020]   100% bet my children on it.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:14.020]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:15.020]   Maybe.
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.020]   Yeah.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:21.860]   The revolution is, I think, for community internet, for municipalities and so forth.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:27.100]   But unfortunately, then what happens is the government comes in and prevents that.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:31.420]   As has happened in many states, they've gone through, I think, 30 of the 50 states because
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:34.820]   the telcos don't want competition from municipal internet.
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:35.820]   And prohibited.
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:39.660]   But that's H-forks is the answer.
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:43.980]   Are you sure today brought to you by Audible.com Audible?
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.420]   Well, we did talk about this in great extent last week, but I knew Brian that you had a
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:48.420]   different point of view.
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.300]   So I wanted to give you a chance to say something.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:54.140]   We were supposed to have Alexis Onhenian on the show today.
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.820]   He's on a plane, unfortunately.
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:57.060]   But he's got the right solution.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:03.540]   He's buying a billboard outside the FCC offices saying, "Don't touch the internet."
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:07.020]   That's good.
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.260]   Who can argue with that?
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.260]   Our show today brought to you-
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:14.300]   I have a new favorite audiobook, maybe of all time, Leo.
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:15.300]   Yes.
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:16.420]   And it's going to kill me if you've already read it.
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:17.420]   I have.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:18.420]   No.
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:19.420]   You probably have.
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:20.420]   No.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:21.900]   Tell me you've read The Martian by Andy Weir.
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.060]   No, I never even heard of it.
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:25.060]   Are you kidding me?
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:26.140]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.380]   I have a gift for you.
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.740]   And for everyone else, the last time I was this excited about a book was when it was
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.220]   Ready Player One by my buddy Ernie Klein.
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:37.300]   Somebody recommended they check out The Martian, takes place.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:40.740]   First of all, it's exquisitely well acted by the guy who reads it.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.100]   It takes place on the minor spoilers that you learn in the first few pages coming up.
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:49.220]   The opening line is, you know, log soul six.
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.980]   I'm pretty much effed.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:57.540]   And it's the log of a astronaut who's six days into their five-month mission.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.420]   The second mission ever to Mars, six days into the five-month mission, there's a storm
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:04.820]   that comes in that's so bad they have to scrub the mission.
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:09.140]   In the shuffle of getting from point A to point B, the communications dish breaks off
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:11.020]   and stabs him and knocks him.
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:15.820]   His readings show up as dead and depressurized.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.460]   They leave without him.
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:23.420]   He wakes up and realizes that he is alone and marooned on Mars.
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.180]   And all he's got is a few bits of pieces laying around.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:30.340]   He knows the next Mars mission is three years away, but he's only got five, you know, a
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:32.140]   year and a half worth of food.
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:33.780]   And it's how he makes his way.
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:35.940]   It's Robinson Caruso on Mars.
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:37.900]   The voice is exquisite.
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.420]   The story is so good.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:40.820]   I got my wife on it.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:43.900]   My wife is not a sci-fi nut, but she loved it.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:47.620]   And it was so exciting that we spent the last, I walked in and she had it on speaker and
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.900]   she was clearly in the last hour.
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:55.620]   I sat there in the dark in my bed holding Bonnie's hand, excitedly listening to the climactic
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:57.420]   conclusion for a second time.
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:00.660]   It's been forever since I've loved a book as much as I love the Martian.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:02.420]   Definitely, definitely, definitely try it.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.420]   I am.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:05.660]   So I want to show you what happens here at audible.com.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:06.660]   And this is going to happen to you.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:07.660]   I'm going to get two credits.
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.100]   I'll explain how you do it, but you add it to your cart and you'll look and you'll see,
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:13.980]   oh my goodness, this is amazing.
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.980]   The cost, nothing.
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:16.980]   Absolutely zero.
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.460]   That's a magic trick.
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.460]   It's a magic trick.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:21.660]   This is worthy of scam school.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:24.420]   Next step to absolutely not zero.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:30.660]   Next step, log in with your brand new platinum account on audible.com, download the book and
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:31.660]   start listening.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:34.740]   I'm going to complete the purchase because you just sold me on that book and I'm going
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:37.420]   to buy it right now, the Martian by Andy Weir.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:38.420]   And there you go.
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:39.420]   Total charge, nothing.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.420]   One credit applied.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.260]   I am golden.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:45.820]   You can do this twice if you go to audible.com/twitdo.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:48.140]   There are two books waiting for you.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:52.540]   Actually I turned chat onto a book and I'm sure you've read this, Brian, that he's really
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:53.540]   liking it.
[01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:55.220]   It's called the wind up girl, right?
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:56.620]   Yeah, the wind up girl.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:58.140]   I've been listening to it for now.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:01.620]   I think I'm close to an hour into it.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:03.540]   Brian, have you heard of this book?
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:04.540]   No.
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:05.540]   Yes, I think you would like it.
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:11.980]   Brian is the one who recommended that 1038, that weird Q230.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:16.180]   Well, what he's really going to be excited about is Brian, you love snow crash.
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:22.060]   And the world that Snow Crash painted and that's what me and Leo were talking about
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:29.540]   and he said the wind up girl and I'm already into it and it's absolutely that sort of dystopian,
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:32.300]   futuristic, commercial.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:38.780]   And by the way, this probably reflects on my crackpot bizarro views of the world where
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.700]   when you read Snow Crash, it's clearly meant to be a dystopian hellhole.
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:45.500]   But as I read it, I'm like, oh, that seems pretty good.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.980]   Yeah, everything go for grabs.
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:52.100]   You can have your own currency, your own citizenship in multiple franchises.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:53.700]   Yeah, no, I'm down for that.
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.860]   We do have a tradition.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:59.260]   I should mention that when we have an author in studio who has a book on audible, we also
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.260]   mentioned that.
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:03.780]   One of your books could be this, Robert Scobel's latest, he wrote it with Shell Israel, the
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:09.300]   age of context, mobile sensors, data and the future of privacy, talking about exactly
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.300]   these issues.
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:13.340]   Well, you know, this is the problem with Audible.
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:14.820]   There's so many great books.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:17.380]   We're going to give you an Audible account that's good for two books.
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:20.020]   Your first month is free at audible.com/twit2.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:22.580]   Those first two credits are free.
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.060]   That's usually two books.
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:26.340]   Some books are a little more.
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:29.340]   And you, you know, if you cancel in the first 30 days, you'll pay nothing.
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.820]   The books are always going to be yours.
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:35.060]   You also get the daily download of the Daily Digest of the New York Times of the Wall Street
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.060]   Journal.
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.060]   That's part of a subscription.
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.060]   I love Audible.
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.420]   We all listen to Audible like crazy.
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:42.300]   I love that it syncs up to the Kindle app.
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.980]   So if you read to page 49 and the Kindle, it's weird.
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:48.020]   And then you go in your car and start listening to the Audible book.
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:49.420]   It starts on page 49.
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:50.420]   It's really nice.
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:51.420]   Whisper sync.
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.420]   That's really a cool thing.
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.420]   Yeah.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:54.420]   Whisper sync for voice, I guess they call it.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:58.180]   So you can actually read and then listen and then read and then listen.
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:59.180]   We love Audible.
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:03.300]   Best readers, the best books, 150,000 strong.
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:04.300]   You know we're fans.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.300]   Brian's a big fan.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.540]   Brian's turned me on to so many great books.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.380]   I can't wait to listen to the Martian.
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:15.500]   Right now I'm listening to Flash Mob, the wonderful Michael Lewis book about high frequency
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:16.500]   traders.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.020]   That's an eye opener in the unfairness of Wall Street.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.780]   There's so many great books.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:23.580]   And it's like an education always in your brain.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.660]   Once you're at a school, Marcus, you'll realize that nobody's pouring anything in your brain
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:28.660]   anymore.
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:33.460]   You're going to have to find a new source of information into your brain.
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.700]   Flash Boys is at it.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   Flash Boys.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:36.700]   Sorry.
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:37.700]   Flash Mob.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.700]   Flash Boys.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:40.980]   Do you get to do any reading for pleasure, Marcus?
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.180]   You work all the time because you got school and then you do your things and...
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:45.180]   No time.
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:46.180]   No time.
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.180]   No time.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:49.300]   No books on that bedside table there.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.300]   Nothing.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:52.700]   There's an iPad over there.
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:54.100]   Do you read on the iPad?
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.700]   Those are all the textbooks.
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:58.700]   Where do you go to school?
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.300]   Stevens Tech in Hoboken.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.580]   And you are a major business major?
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:05.860]   Yeah, business and technology is the name of the major.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:10.900]   I am glad that they are teaching you about net neutrality and stuff like that.
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.900]   That's really good.
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:14.100]   I think one thing Brian and I both agree on it.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:15.100]   Let me see if I can...
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:16.420]   Let's try this.
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:19.140]   We should get the influence of money out of politics.
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.540]   Oh, sure.
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:21.540]   I think.
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:24.540]   I mean, the problem is like, what does that mean?
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.100]   Well, it's hard to do, isn't it?
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:30.500]   Because you can say that and say, which is why all ads should be banned.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:31.500]   Well, yeah.
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:35.460]   Or you can say, which is why anyone who owns a media station should never be allowed to
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.420]   talk without giving equal time to another.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:41.500]   I mean, the problem is we agree like money is a corrupting influence.
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.820]   But the question is, how do we get to fix it?
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:44.820]   Right.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:49.220]   Well, I have thoughts, but I don't think it's appropriate for this discussion.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.460]   So we're going to move on.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:52.860]   I know how we can get money out of politics.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.980]   Get Marissa Meyer to foot the bill.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:58.820]   She, she, I think got $200 million last year for her compensation.
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:03.420]   We were all feeling bad for her because they fired her number two and he got this big severance
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.420]   package.
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:05.420]   I don't feel too bad.
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:06.420]   I don't feel bad for Marissa.
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:08.420]   She's done all right.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:15.060]   According to an analysis by Equilar, as much perhaps as $214 million cash stock and options
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:16.060]   in Yahoo.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:21.060]   Although Marissa, just a tip, you might want to sell that Yahoo stock as fast as you can.
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.060]   Don't know.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.060]   Hold on.
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:24.900]   I mean, that's the catch 22, right?
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:25.900]   Yeah.
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:26.900]   She would exercise all that.
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:28.540]   It would not reflect well on her prospects.
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:31.660]   But Larry Allison is an example oracle CEO.
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:34.300]   78.4 million.
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.300]   Nothing.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.300]   A pittance.
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:37.300]   The poor guy.
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:41.100]   I don't know how he lives.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:42.420]   Is it, is it all?
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:45.860]   No, there's no way for me to say what I was going to say without starting another rabbit
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:46.860]   hole.
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:47.860]   Well, let's, let's move on to some of those.
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:52.460]   Well, and Rike de Castro, who was brought over from Google, Marissa brought him over
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:56.780]   to run ads advertising it at Yahoo was fired.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:02.700]   Got a severance package of $109 million, 15 months, COO, 15 months, $109 million.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:08.220]   I think that Yahoo is doing better than anybody thinks or either that or they're just hemorrhaging
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:10.020]   money to their executives.
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:12.580]   Amazon is open to wearable technology store.
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:18.780]   We got Scoble over here wearing two cameras, his Google Glass's narrative clip.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:24.580]   And Amazon is now bringing a store where you can buy all this crap.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.580]   What do you think?
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:30.140]   Well, it's, you know, we're all waiting for the Apple watch.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:32.940]   What do you think, Mark has the founder wearable?
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.540]   You were, were you were the Fitbit Flex?
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:40.060]   I was wearing the Pebble and then the Pebble steel by switch back to the original Pebble.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.460]   Ah, what's wrong with the steel?
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:46.300]   I just don't like the design as much as I thought I would actually prefer the thinner
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.500]   polyurethane band.
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.500]   It's just more versatile as a, as a wearable, I guess, for what I do instead of having
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:52.980]   a metal on my wrist all the time.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:54.700]   So I've been wearing the basis watch.
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.900]   So basis doesn't have any of the Pebble notification or calendar stuff.
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:58.900]   It's just a health watch.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:02.580]   It has a heart rate monitor steps.
[01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:07.980]   It syncs with the phone using low tower Bluetooth, which is nice.
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:09.060]   So it's a good health watch.
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:10.580]   It seems like there's three categories.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:14.980]   There's the health watches like Fitbit Flex, the basis.
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:21.300]   The extension of the phone watches like the Pebble.
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:24.140]   And then of course, Galaxy Gear Fit does both.
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:27.060]   So it's possible to combine the two.
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.500]   And then what was the third category?
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.180]   Seems like maybe we should have a watch that.
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:33.180]   Like isn't it independent?
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:35.060]   There's specialized ones for triathletes or something.
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:36.060]   It's independent.
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:38.260]   Like does it need a phone?
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:40.620]   It just does its own thing.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:43.060]   Yeah, but are you still down?
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:47.700]   Last time we talked about this, Leo, you were not so crazy about the Pebble.
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:48.700]   Whereas I love mine.
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:50.420]   I gave Chad my Pebble.
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:51.420]   Love in it.
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:52.420]   Really?
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.420]   He loves loving his.
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:55.020]   So you still wear the Pebble?
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:56.020]   Tell me.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.020]   Oh, yeah?
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:58.020]   No, I'm sure.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:59.020]   You wear the Pebble?
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:00.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.020]   No, right here.
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:05.180]   Keep in mind like the thing is if you receive, let's say, a hundred notifications of any
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:09.940]   variety a day and let's say conservatively it takes you four or five seconds to pull out
[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.620]   your phone and check or whatever.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:14.100]   You realize every single day you wear a Pebble, that's what?
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:17.780]   Five hundred seconds saved by just glancing instead of pulling the phone out.
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:18.780]   That's what?
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.780]   Five, ten minutes of free time.
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.500]   But I don't want to wear an ugly ass watch just to save a few minutes.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:27.780]   Well, it's ugly ass now, but this thing I said before, this is the Palm Pilot of the
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:28.780]   watch, right?
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:29.780]   And I was a big pilot.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:30.780]   The Newton came out.
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:32.860]   The Newton came out and it was hilarious.
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:36.660]   And then the Palm Pilot said, let's do less and do it better.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.140]   And it took off.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:39.980]   And I look forward to what's happened.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.900]   What's funny though, is I love wearing it.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.060]   I love my Pebble.
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:46.340]   Every time we shoot scam school, I take it off and put it in my pocket because I'm so
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:50.420]   aware of how hilarious it's going to look three or four years from now.
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.420]   Right.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.060]   Might as well have a giant phone that you talk on.
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.060]   Exactly.
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:56.460]   Marcus, what would be the per...
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:57.460]   So you're an athlete.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:59.540]   So Marcus plays ultimate Frisbee.
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.540]   Right.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:04.780]   So you're an athlete, but what would be the ultimate in a wearable for you?
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:05.780]   What do you think will happen?
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:08.580]   What do you look for?
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:13.740]   I don't usually wear my watch when I'm working out or practicing or anything, but when I
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:17.740]   have the Pebble on, like in class, it's for the same reason as Brian said, because I can
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:21.220]   just glance instead of pulling my phone in my pocket, which teachers apparently hate,
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:22.220]   by the way.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:25.940]   So if you're just, I guess, glancing at your watch might steal on the way.
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:26.940]   That's insulting.
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:27.940]   If you're a teacher.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.900]   It looks like you're going, when is this class going to be over?
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:32.340]   I'm just waiting, begging for the class to end.
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:36.740]   But I feel like it's a quicker glance and I cannot take as many seconds of attention away
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.980]   from whatever the class is about.
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:43.220]   So just as a student, I guess, I'm a fan of the Pebble on the notifications.
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.540]   That's one reason I never took to the Pebble, because when I'm sitting anywhere, my phone's
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:48.940]   right in front of me.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.340]   And on my car, I have a dashboard mount for my phone.
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:56.660]   So I don't need the glance ability that much.
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:57.660]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:00.460]   It's just that I have to take my phone out in my pocket.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:04.300]   And then if I was in school and I wasn't able to look at my phone because my teacher
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:07.620]   didn't like it, I totally got my own.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:11.620]   So Tim Cook here, calling from Apple for Marcus Brownlee.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.700]   Hey, Marcus, good talking to you.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:15.000]   Love your stuff.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.140]   What do you think we should do with the eye watch?
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.140]   What do you think?
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:19.340]   Just anything you say?
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:21.500]   Just tell me, wouldn't you?
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:22.820]   Wow.
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:25.260]   It should be light.
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:26.300]   It should not be...
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.860]   It's hard because I don't know.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:29.140]   I'm not a fashion designer.
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:34.260]   I just think the design of it is going to be extremely important for it.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:36.260]   The way it looks, the way it's designed.
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:40.740]   Yeah, I feel like it's too early for them to try to get away with any kind of design
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:43.500]   that looks felt or thin or try to sell us on it.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:49.980]   I say, own the thickness, own the blockiness for now, which I feel like Apple would be
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:50.980]   able to do.
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:54.380]   See, we keep seeing Moto 360 and then...
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:55.900]   I think that looks sweet.
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:57.620]   Don't you like the Moto 360?
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:42:58.620]   No, I do.
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:42:59.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:00.620]   That's what I'm looking forward to most.
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:03.620]   I can't wait till we actually get to physically have it.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:05.140]   And that's going to be at the summer, they say.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.140]   It looks like a watch.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.140]   It's round.
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.140]   Exactly.
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.140]   It's a little thick.
[01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:11.140]   It's got...
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:14.700]   I see to me, this is the closest thing that I've seen.
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:18.500]   I just have a couple of concerns about the display and the battery life.
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:19.500]   Right.
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:20.500]   Those two things.
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:23.420]   Just because it's obviously not that big, so it's going to have an LCD display that
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.860]   should be bright enough to view outdoors.
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:29.220]   But also, if it's a watch, it's always on, so you're just glancing at the time.
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:33.900]   So it's always on very bright LCD, in which case you're burning through battery constantly
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:36.820]   and have a really short life, or does it have a huge battery?
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:37.980]   I don't know how that's going to work.
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:39.340]   So I'm curious.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:42.780]   That is the one thing that I really adore about the Pebble is the fact that I really
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:46.060]   do only charge it once a week, basically.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.060]   That is...
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.060]   Everybody agrees.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:49.060]   That's one of the best things.
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:54.060]   So you interviewed the new CEO of Motorola yourself, Marques.
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.300]   Did you talk about any of this stuff?
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:57.500]   I interviewed...
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:03.380]   You hinted at the fact that they were working on wearables when I interviewed him.
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:04.380]   So did you...
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:05.740]   It wasn't Dennis Woodside.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:06.740]   You talked to the new guy.
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.740]   No, no, no.
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:08.740]   I talked to Dennis.
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:09.740]   You talked to Dennis.
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:10.740]   Okay.
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:12.740]   So he's no longer CEO.
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:13.740]   He's moved on.
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:18.540]   So he hinted at this.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:21.940]   But we now know, because they've announced it, this is not a guess.
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:22.940]   Right.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:23.940]   Right.
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:26.740]   Rick Osterlo has taken over for him as an interesting fellow.
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:30.180]   I like him a lot.
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:32.540]   He was the guy who designed blur.
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:40.140]   Motorola blur, which was among the worst of the carrier improvements on Android.
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.300]   And I said, "Rick, I'm sorry.
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.300]   That's a terrible thing.
[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:43.300]   Why did you do that?"
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:49.780]   He said, "We had to, because Android in the version 2 was so god awful that nobody would
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:50.780]   have bought it.
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:52.580]   We had to clean it up a little bit."
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:53.580]   But he says, "Now."
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.380]   And that's when Motorola X came out.
[01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:56.700]   He said, "Now we don't need to.
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:45:01.620]   It's a beautiful UI and a great OS and we don't have to modify it.
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:04.020]   I think the Moto 360 is my."
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:05.380]   But this is a notification watch.
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:06.380]   It's not a health watch.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:09.380]   It sounds like you don't have any interest in a health watch.
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:10.380]   No.
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:12.100]   I don't wear it for any fitness.
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:15.580]   I've never even bought a Fitbit or a Nike fuel band or anything.
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:16.580]   I just don't.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:17.580]   That's because you're fit.
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:18.580]   Where stuff when I work out.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:19.580]   No, I do work out.
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:23.380]   Like a pedometer seems like a cool idea, but I just don't have it turned on on my Galaxy
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:24.380]   S5.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:27.060]   I don't really care how many steps I take.
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:28.260]   I don't know.
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:30.980]   Well, and I do the stuff I do.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:31.980]   It never registers.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:34.780]   So I row for half an hour and I look and it says you took three steps.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:37.420]   It's like, "No."
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:39.060]   Then Lisa says, "Well, you know you rowed."
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:41.620]   I said, "Yes, but I want credit for it.
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.620]   I want credit.
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:43.620]   I want bar.
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:44.620]   I want points.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:45.780]   You know you rowed.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:46.780]   You rowed."
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:47.940]   No, but I didn't.
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:49.140]   I have to.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:50.540]   And how's Kevin Rose going to know?
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:54.700]   I don't show up on the leaderboard.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:57.420]   I don't get any credit for it.
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:45:58.420]   Do you like Marcus?
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:45:59.420]   Do you like that S5?
[01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:00.900]   Is that your daily driver?
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:04.420]   No, my daily driver is the one to meet Google Play.
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:05.420]   Yeah, baby.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:06.420]   Is that you too?
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:07.420]   Yeah.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:08.420]   Why don't you use a Google Play edition?
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:12.260]   I actually think that the stock HTC Sense is not so bad.
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.420]   I do like Sense 6, but I still prefer stock Android.
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:19.180]   So that's where I'm at right now with my daily driver.
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:21.060]   I'm testing a couple other phones.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:25.660]   How do you think the camera, oh, the one, you got the, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.420]   Hold that up again.
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:29.100]   You have a OnePlus one.
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:30.100]   One, yeah.
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:32.180]   This is a really exciting phone.
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:35.420]   You don't think that's a, so obviously for a long time I thought this is a scam.
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.420]   This is a fake.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.420]   They're never going to release anything.
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:38.420]   It's a real phone.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:39.780]   It works.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:40.780]   In the flesh, yeah.
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:44.180]   It's a living, breathing, cyan, gin, I turned it off.
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:46.020]   Cyan, gin, mod, phone.
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:51.020]   And of course I like stock Android so much so I'm a fan of the OS here, the interface.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.500]   The camera is very impressive.
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.420]   And the price is the most impressive part of it.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:56.420]   So I'm out of time.
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:57.420]   I think, what's that?
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:58.420]   What they're going to?
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:46:59.620]   This is the 16 gig.
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:00.620]   So it's 300.
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:01.620]   300.
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:06.900]   And then the 64 gig is in black and that'll be 350.
[01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:09.740]   So here's, so this is the reason I thought it was a scam.
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:13.380]   First of all, OnePlus one OPO and these guys came from Oppo.
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:14.380]   OPPO.
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:18.380]   So I thought it's really an Oppo phone, isn't it?
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.620]   I mean, yeah.
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:20.860]   I see a lot of the resemblance.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:23.620]   I see a lot of the same design language.
[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:27.260]   I have the fine 7A next to me too and it's very similar.
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:28.260]   Hold it up though.
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:29.260]   It looks pretty.
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:30.260]   It looks very thin.
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:31.420]   Let me see the one most one.
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:33.060]   It might even be the same panel.
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:35.700]   It's a 5.5 inch 1080p display.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.700]   It's a nice big phone.
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:38.380]   It's got the silver trim around it.
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:40.780]   I guess I prefer this design a little bit more.
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:45.580]   The back of the camera actually looks almost the exact same as the fine 7A.
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:51.300]   In fact, how can they sell this phone for 350 bucks though?
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:53.500]   This is impossible.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:54.500]   That's the question.
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:56.500]   Cost on these things are coming way down.
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:59.180]   Well, and they'll give it to you for a buck if you smash your phone.
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:00.180]   Did you see that?
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.180]   What do you think of that one?
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:03.060]   That I'm glad they turned back on that.
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.060]   Oh, they did?
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:05.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:08.260]   They got a clue that that wasn't the best idea.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:13.940]   So they were offering this contest, I guess, where they would you submit your phone and
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:19.820]   your idea for smashing it and they would pick 100 people and then you smash your phone.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:20.820]   You're right here.
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.820]   You want to get that?
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:22.820]   No.
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:24.620]   Every day there's a traffic jam at this exact hour.
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:25.820]   People love beeping their harm.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:26.820]   And people like to be.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:27.820]   What's wrong?
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:28.820]   It could possibly go wrong.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:29.820]   Go ahead.
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:30.820]   I'm sorry.
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:34.540]   So they turned back on it and now they're allowing the 100 winners that they did select to donate
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:36.460]   their phone instead of smashing it.
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:37.460]   Oh, good.
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:39.700]   Much better idea.
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:43.380]   Although you know those guys with a blender blend tech, they smash stuff all the time.
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:44.940]   Nobody says anything about it.
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:45.940]   It's true.
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:46.940]   Will it blend show?
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:48.980]   I visited them, but it wasn't 100 phones.
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:49.980]   Well, that's right.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:50.980]   These will be 100 phones.
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:57.100]   It'll be a and they really wanted you to take a video one take of you smashing it demonstrating
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:59.340]   not only that it was smashed, but it can no longer turn on.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.980]   So you have to turn it on, show it, hit it with a hammer, show it again, then it's not
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:04.980]   turning on now.
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:07.340]   It seems like a lot.
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:09.780]   I'm just searching my inbox to see if I got anything from him.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:10.780]   I guess not.
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:14.340]   So I guess I'm going to have to wait.
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.100]   Do you feel like this phone is ready?
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.700]   Is it buggy or is it reliable?
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.660]   So this one I have here is like super alpha.
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:25.740]   It doesn't actually have volume buttons, but they're sending me another one that's like
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.620]   finished packaging, finished product.
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:30.460]   But right now from the software, it's fine.
[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:32.460]   I mean, it's a sign engine mod entirely.
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:37.100]   It doesn't have any bugs or quirks once it's working.
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.500]   So I mean, I feel like it's working great.
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.100]   And you said you really like the camera.
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:42.100]   Tell me about the camera.
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:43.100]   I do.
[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:44.100]   I was impressed.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:45.260]   So it has this new camera app from signage and mod.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.180]   Of course, you can, you know, you can swipe in stock Android from the side.
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:52.580]   So you swipe in a little bit and it says, okay, well, open the camera.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:53.580]   That's cool.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:59.180]   It's the whole entire viewfinder, first of all, so I like that.
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:00.180]   It's really simple.
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:01.180]   It takes 4K video.
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:02.860]   It takes 1080p.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:08.220]   The slow mo HD video in 720p takes 13 megapixel photos, I believe.
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.220]   Wow.
[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:10.220]   And they look really good.
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:11.220]   Sweet dynamic range.
[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:13.460]   Better than your M8.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:14.460]   Definitely better than the M8.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:17.140]   I actually, I know the M8 is on like 4 megapixels.
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:19.460]   I think it looks, I like the camera pictures out of it.
[01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:24.700]   The Google play edition M8 doesn't take nearly as good pictures, unfortunately.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.020]   And I do like pixels.
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.500]   So I'm not a fan of it only being a 4 megapixel camera.
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.500]   I like the zoom in and pixel peep.
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.020]   I guess I'm not normal on that.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:37.580]   But when I'm looking at Galaxy S5 photos and iPhone 5S photos, I'm way more impressed.
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:41.140]   So I think this is a lot closer to those cameras, which is impressive because it's so cheap.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.580]   Is that what the kids are calling it now?
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:43.580]   Pixel peep?
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:46.460]   I'm maybe I'm weird that I have Pixel peep.
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.460]   I don't know.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:48.460]   That's what I call it.
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:49.460]   I like to check out.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.260]   Wait, wait, you zoom in on it and you're pixel peeping it?
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:52.780]   Yeah, on my own phone.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:57.500]   Just because if I'm taking a landscape shot and I'm literally comparing the quality of,
[01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:58.500]   you know, two different camera.
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:02.100]   And I took the same picture on both of these cameras that I'm trying to compare with.
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:03.100]   Looks better.
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:06.020]   So I'm zooming in on the edge of something and I look at one and it's softer here and
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:07.940]   it's sharper here.
[01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:09.940]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:11.940]   All right.
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:13.140]   Well, I thought it was a scam.
[01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:18.020]   So it's not and it'll be out this summer and will it be it really will be 300 to 350
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:19.020]   bucks.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:20.020]   That's what they're saying.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.420]   That's now you're talking to talking the Nexus 5 prices.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:27.100]   It'll be interesting to see what they hand out at Google I/O this year.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:30.540]   Now the rumor, I don't know if this is true, the rumor is that they're going to replace
[01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:33.940]   Nexus with the silver edition.
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:39.820]   This sounds awfully like what Microsoft did with their signature PCs, which nobody made
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:40.820]   Visio.
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:46.020]   I think it made the idea of being, God, you people are crapping up our Windows devices.
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:51.740]   So we're going to sell a signature PC that's pure Windows and none of the manufacturers
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:53.060]   bought bought it.
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:56.740]   They said, no, we need to make money off our crapware.
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:01.980]   And it feels like the silver edition is kind of the same idea.
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:03.540]   What do you think, Marcus?
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:05.820]   It reminds me of the Google play edition stuff.
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:06.820]   Right.
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.980]   I'm not sure how it's different.
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:10.780]   Originally, I saw no reason for it to exist at all.
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:15.900]   I'm still kind of, you know, I don't, I'm not sure what benefit it has to a company
[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.700]   that to have a Google play edition other than to be more developer friendly and have that
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:21.020]   relationship with Google.
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:25.220]   But when the Google play edition, Galaxy S5 first came out that blew my mind.
[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:30.380]   So it reminds me a lot of the same program and I'd be curious if that's an actual thing,
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:31.380]   not just a rumor.
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:32.380]   Yeah, we don't know.
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:38.100]   And they may still make the Nexus phones, which are made by Google to Google specs,
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:43.060]   as opposed to say, I'm going to take the Galaxy S5 or the HTC one and just make it
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:44.060]   a pure Android.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:48.220]   Because that's what I keep saying is the only reason or the main reason the Nexus exists
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:53.500]   is to show that Google spec like they keep, they move away from things like the SD cards
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:56.180]   and they move away from capacitive buttons.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:53:01.820]   And if they were to use the Galaxy S5 as a Google play edition, you still have the SD card
[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:04.860]   and the fiscal home button and all that stuff that you're trying to move away from.
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:10.300]   So Nexus serves to move at least software and hardware in the same direction Google wants.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:12.220]   Well, and you could thank Nexus for the new M8.
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:15.220]   They got rid of the, you know, they got that capacitive buttons.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:16.220]   They've got on-screen buttons.
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:20.820]   And then you know, I was a, not a fan at first and I actually think it's great.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:23.140]   This is, I see where Google was going with this thing.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:24.220]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:25.780]   Come up with more and just a bit.
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:26.780]   MKBHD is here.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:32.660]   Marcus Brownlee, Robert Scobel, the Scobelizer, Brian Brushwood, night train.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:33.900]   Brushwood, Isaac.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:36.260]   The Brushwood, Isaac.
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:42.180]   Is it night train or is that a fortified alcohol?
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:43.180]   Night attack.
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:44.180]   Night, night attack.
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:48.780]   I was really confused if you were still talking to me.
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:49.780]   Night attack.
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:50.780]   It's the name of the show.
[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:51.780]   Night train Thunderbirds.
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:53.780]   I don't want to do a night train show.
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:54.780]   It's amazing.
[01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:56.940]   Boone's Farm Strawberry is our new podcast.
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:57.940]   It's amazing.
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:00.500]   It's show brought to you by Night Train.
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.540]   Zima, our new podcast.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.140]   Good '11s.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:09.820]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:12.940]   The only one platform that makes it easy to create your own professional website, your
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:15.540]   online portfolio, your store.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:18.820]   I want you to visit squarespace.com.
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:19.820]   Let's take a look.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:21.340]   They are constantly improving the platform.
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:25.180]   If you haven't been there in a month, there's all new stuff.
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:30.980]   New features, new designs, better support, 25 fantastic designer templates.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:35.420]   Now, you might say, "Well, okay, but no, but there's something about these templates."
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:41.700]   First of all, this is the state of the art now in a web design.
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:44.100]   They're using state of the art CSS and JavaScript.
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:45.380]   They're mobile responsive.
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:48.380]   That means you don't have a mobile site that's separate from your main site.
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:50.100]   It just all looks great.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.100]   That's really important.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:55.020]   I think if you're going to do a website these days, it should just flow into the screen
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:59.300]   naturally whatever size screen you're using, even a four-inch iPhone screen.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:02.220]   There's e-commerce on all the templates now.
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:06.620]   Even for the $8 a month plan, you can get e-commerce, which means if you're doing a
[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:10.220]   benefit for a school, a fundraiser, if you want to...
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.540]   You can do that.
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:13.580]   Cash wedding registry.
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:20.380]   Email or chat support 24/7 right from the Squarespace offices in New York City.

[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:25.500]   video workshops.
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.300]   They do webinars.
[01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:31.180]   This is hosting plus software to give you the best possible experience.
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.260]   They even got apps.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:33.500]   They're so good.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:34.740]   Their developers are so good.
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:40.580]   They've got the Squarespace metric app, which lets you check your site stats like page
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:43.300]   views, unique visitors, social media followers.
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:45.180]   It's iPad and iPhone.
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:52.660]   They've got a blog app that makes it so easy to post, to moderate comments.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:53.660]   They've got the logo designer.
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:54.660]   I can go on and on.
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:56.940]   The best thing to do is just go to Squarespace.com.

[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:31.900]   Quick run through of the last few news stories.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:38.780]   Daily motion, the European YouTube says Google's cheating, serving up YouTube results instead
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:40.700]   of daily motion results.
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:45.100]   It was always the fear that Google would favor its own sites and I always thought Google
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:50.020]   shouldn't be in the content business for that reason.
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:55.420]   This is the first I've heard of actually somebody saying this is actually happening.
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:57:01.500]   I will say that I almost never catch a daily motion link when I do a Google search on any
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:02.500]   of this.
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:05.140]   I've got a new series.
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:07.180]   I'll see if I search for Mario Batali.
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:13.220]   They've got a new made here series of him cooking.
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.460]   No, I don't see a thing.
[01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:17.300]   I see Mario Batali YouTube.
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:22.940]   See, now I don't want to say that this is a nefarious anti-competitive practice on YouTube.
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:27.580]   Google would say, no, no, this is what people want.
[01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:28.580]   Right?
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:33.620]   Yeah, I would be curious to see how much of their secret sauce they could expose to justify
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:38.980]   it because I do agree that daily motion is definitely underrepresented considering the
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:41.300]   size of that site.
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:47.740]   It seems fairly credible, but we don't know.
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:50.180]   Let's see, Microsoft blinks.
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:51.540]   Is to work at Microsoft.
[01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:53.660]   They said we are not going to update Windows XP.
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:54.660]   That's it.
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:55.660]   It's over.
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:56.660]   April 8th.
[01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:57.660]   That's the last update.
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:02.820]   Well, it turns out there was a zero-day flood and an explored, affected all versions of Windows,
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:07.620]   including XP, so they sent out a patch last week.
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:08.620]   Does this mean?
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:10.060]   Wait, they went back?
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:11.900]   They patched the XP thing?
[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:13.900]   That's a bummer.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:15.860]   I feel like they should have stood firm.
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:17.460]   Stay firm, Microsoft.
[01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:18.460]   It's really...
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:22.540]   When I worked at Microsoft, the guy who runs the Internet Explorer team pulled me into
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:25.980]   his office and explained how life is for him.
[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:32.580]   They have so many customers with so many installs that if the CTO of XYZ big company calls
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:35.180]   you up and says, "You fixed this or I'm moving to Linux?"
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:38.260]   You decide to fix it.
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:40.620]   Yep.
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:45.620]   I thought this was an interesting story, free market story.
[01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:49.300]   In fact, it takes place in your neck of the woods, Mr. Brian Brushwood.
[01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:51.780]   There was a startup called Outbox.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:54.060]   Seemed like a great idea.
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:59:01.540]   A couple of guys, they said, "What we're going to do is you fill out a forwarding form
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:04.700]   at the post office and you forward all your mail to us.
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:07.260]   Don't even have it delivered to us, to yourself.
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:08.380]   Just forward to us.
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:09.900]   We will scan it.
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:12.700]   We will let you check boxes, say, "Deliver that, deliver that, don't deliver that, don't
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:13.700]   deliver that."
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:16.340]   It seemed like a great idea.
[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:17.340]   They launched in Austin.
[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:18.540]   I don't know if you've seen this.
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:19.860]   Outbox, have you seen it?
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:20.860]   No.
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:23.980]   What's funny is I saw this story and I didn't understand it and I remember thinking like,
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:24.980]   "I want Leo to explain this to me."
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:25.980]   I'll explain it.
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:26.980]   I'm hearing all this for the first time.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:29.860]   I'll explain it.
[01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:31.740]   They got funding.
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:33.940]   People got excited about it.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:34.940]   They wanted to expand.
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:38.220]   They went to San Francisco, started doing it in San Francisco.
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:39.220]   Everybody wants his.
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:42.300]   Nobody wants snail mail unless they want it.
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:44.500]   So much of his junk mail.
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:48.820]   They get called to meet with the Postmaster General.
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:51.100]   In Washington, D.C., they say, "Oh, this is exciting.
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:55.460]   Maybe the Post Office wants to partner with us because it's a better way."
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:59.020]   They go into the meeting and instead of just Patrick Donahue, the Postmaster General, there
[01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:03.220]   also is the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service and the Chief of Digital
[02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:04.220]   Strategy.
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:08.540]   I could tell this story turns out super great with everybody high-fiving and the customer
[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:12.300]   being happy.
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:15.100]   Evans, this is the story from Inside Sources.
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:24.020]   Evans says, "The Postmaster looked at us and said, 'We have a misunderstanding.
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:28.940]   You disrupt my service and we will never work with you.'"
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:29.940]   This is awful.
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.940]   This is the quote.
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:31.940]   This is the quote.
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:32.940]   This is the quote.
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:33.940]   You want the smoking now?
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:36.220]   This is just Evans recount.
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:41.100]   He says, "The Postmaster General, the guy charged the Postal Service says, 'You mentioned
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:45.700]   making the service better for our customers, but you need to understand the American citizens
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:47.300]   aren't our customers.
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:50.420]   About 400 junk mailers, that's our customers.
[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:55.460]   And your service hurts our ability to serve those customers by keeping that junk mail out
[02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:57.980]   of people's mailbox.
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:00:59.980]   You're putting us out of business."
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:04.980]   Okay, for the record, you were wondering why I'm the nut job who would prefer to not
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:25.860]   see government inject itself in the net-
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:32.860]   By case, your honor.
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:54.860]   You're not going to be a nut job.
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:02:01.860]   I'm not going to harp on it, but this is to me unacceptable.
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:04.860]   It's the reason for my default skepticism of injecting government in the net-
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.860]   All right.
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:06.860]   You know what?
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:07.860]   I'm going to give you this round.
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:08.860]   You're absolutely right.
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:12.100]   In their closing blog post saying, "We're going out of business," they said, "You may
[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:16.260]   think government organizations are completely, insanely backwards.
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:17.260]   You're wrong.
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:18.260]   They're worse."
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:22.660]   Well, look at Las Vegas, right?
[02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:28.900]   They build this new tram, this high-speed tram, and it stops a quarter-mile from the airport.
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:30.660]   Why did they do that?
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:38.660]   We'll catch at this and the same forces that brought that tap in means we don't get Uber
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:39.660]   in Vegas.
[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:44.860]   And you don't get Airbnb in San Francisco, practically banned in San Francisco because
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:48.060]   they don't pay hotel taxes.
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:50.460]   Yeah, you're right.
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:55.460]   I just feel like you're just rubbing my shoulders now, Leo.
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:58.460]   You're making me feel better with all my examples.
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:02:59.460]   I feel good, right?
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:04.260]   I mean, I hate when the world isn't black and white, it's sort of muddy.
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:06.380]   It's like, I mean, I love Airbnb.
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:08.460]   I love, what is it?
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:09.460]   Lyft.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:10.460]   I love Uber.
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:15.060]   I love all of these disruptive services, and it buns me out that people who are using
[02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:17.420]   the hammer of bureaucracy to shut them down.
[02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:18.420]   Yeah.
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:20.540]   Well, I think we should shut this thing down.
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:23.740]   Thank you, Brian Brushwood, for being the voice of reason and bringing that little bit
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:25.740]   of Texas into this show.
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:30.380]   Well, thank you for patronizing me and for putting up with my nonsense.
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.540]   Look, I'm 100% wrong about everything.
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:33.540]   I get that.
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:36.340]   It's just that I'm glad this felt very balanced, Leo.
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:37.780]   It all turned out really well.
[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:39.580]   Damn your eyes, Brushwood.
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:42.700]   Hey, can I tell you guys about a brand new thing?
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:45.420]   And I want to know if Marques thinks this is going to work.
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:48.100]   We launched a brand new series on scam school.
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:51.980]   It's only the second time we've launched something new on the channel.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:56.660]   But at some point, if you've ever watched scam school, every episode is very much modeled
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:58.100]   on a television show.
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:03.140]   Episodes are usually 10 to 15 minutes long, which in the YouTube world is like Lawrence
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:04.140]   of Arabia.
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:08.940]   We have a cold open, we have an intro sequence, we have an intro, and then finally we get into
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:12.500]   people tend to just jump forward, like, just get to the trick, just get to the trick.
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:17.260]   And meanwhile, we have this back catalog of like 300 past episodes of scam school with
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:20.740]   really good bar tricks and clever scams that you could pull on your friends.
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:27.020]   So we decided to try launching something new called scam school remix and the entire episode.
[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:31.420]   For example, the first episode we did, we just released the entire episode is 75 seconds
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:32.420]   long.
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:34.660]   And the idea is waste no time.
[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:39.580]   So 75 seconds, you will learn how to scam.
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:43.060]   Less than that, because the second half of it is all follow up.
[02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:44.620]   I think you learned the track here.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:51.620]   Watch us, you can see the trick right here.
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:05:07.300]   We're going to break your arm doing that.
[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:10.020]   We're 45 seconds in and we're already in to follow up.
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:12.460]   And then the wrap up is the last 30 seconds or so.
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:17.980]   So the idea is we've been like openly hostile to the things that make YouTube successful.
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:20.660]   So now we're trying to embrace it by shortening everything.
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:22.500]   You can't confuse Chad, didn't you?
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:24.260]   Chad thought you were the video.
[02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:26.060]   The video was you.
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:27.780]   You got confused.
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:29.540]   I think you did.
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:30.540]   That happens.
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:33.260]   But Mark has, here's my question to you.
[02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:36.580]   Mark has, how important is brevity in the YouTube world these days?
[02:05:36.580 --> 02:05:37.860]   But don't waste my time.
[02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:38.860]   Get to the point.
[02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:39.860]   Go, go, go.
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:42.300]   Is that, is that a leading factor in how you design your videos?
[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:46.700]   Uh, not necessarily for me, but for YouTube in general, and you have a series going on
[02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:50.340]   and when people are like finding a whole bunch of your stuff at the same time, it does get
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:53.540]   important that it's quick to get to the next point.
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:57.940]   So if someone were to find my, my channel, for example, and want to just browse cruise
[02:05:57.940 --> 02:06:01.700]   through 15 videos, my intro seven seconds long at the beginning, then I get right into
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:02.700]   the content.
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:05.900]   So I guess I do make a point to get right into things.
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:09.420]   But like you were saying, with a 15 minute episode where you're, you're kind of formatting
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:13.340]   after TV where it takes a while to get into what you're actually titling the video, people
[02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:14.900]   might just skip over that.
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:18.460]   And I guess it does make a lot of sense to just, just head right into what you're going to
[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:19.460]   do.
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:22.540]   Uh, if, if you have a title, a thumbnail and the first 10 seconds of the video, you're
[02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:24.500]   already into it, that's very satisfying.
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:25.700]   So when we clicked on it.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:30.460]   Well, I'm really excited that the idea is, and this was my pitch to the folks over at
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:33.860]   Discovery was let's weaponize previous videos.
[02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:39.940]   Let's make them viral gold by taking what was a 10 minute episode of making it 90 seconds.
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:41.540]   We'll see if that works out.
[02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:42.540]   Yeah.
[02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:44.100]   Awesome.
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:50.220]   You can find Marcus, of course, on YouTube, uh, M K B H D YouTube.com slash M K B H D just
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:51.220]   the one channel.
[02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:56.620]   You're not going to do an M K for H D M K B for H D or K now.
[02:06:56.620 --> 02:06:57.620]   Just, just this one.
[02:06:57.620 --> 02:06:58.620]   Just the one channel.
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:00.380]   That's it right there.
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:02.740]   It is awesome.
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:07.260]   And uh, Marcus, uh, Marcus has actually showed that people on YouTube will watch longer
[02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:09.580]   videos with more content.
[02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:10.660]   And I, that encourages me.
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:11.700]   I think that's really great.
[02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:12.700]   You do great stuff.
[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:13.700]   It's good to have you all.
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:14.700]   Appreciate it.
[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:19.420]   And yeah, your review of the, uh, one plus one is, uh, is right up there too.
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:20.420]   Was that a Tesla?
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:21.940]   Do you drive a Tesla to?
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:22.940]   I did.
[02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:25.580]   I drove the new, uh, Mercedes Benz electric.
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:26.580]   Yeah.
[02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:27.580]   I saw you at Marcus.
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:28.580]   You had an exclusive on that one.
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:29.580]   How'd you like that?
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:30.580]   I watched that video.
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:31.580]   It was pretty sweet.
[02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:32.580]   It was nice.
[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:37.260]   It, you know, I, uh, at South by Southwest BMW got me the I three, uh, which is, that's
[02:07:37.260 --> 02:07:40.660]   BMW's electric and it's, these are $40,000 cars.
[02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:41.660]   Right.
[02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:42.660]   $45,000.
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:45.220]   Um, the, the Mercedes is bigger.
[02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:46.220]   It's a little quieter.
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:47.220]   It's a Tesla.
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:48.220]   It's the one they get, isn't it?
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:53.220]   Yeah, but that's a hundred thousand dollars, you know, or 70,000 plus, you know, so out
[02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:54.700]   of my budget, right?
[02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:57.740]   I mean, 45, but even the I three is out of my budget.
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:07:58.740]   Would you consider that?
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:00.620]   I, I'm looking at it.
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:02.220]   My, my Prius is five years old now.
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:03.380]   So I'm definitely looking.
[02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:05.380]   I, I'm, you know what to watch out for?
[02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:09.940]   I'm hoping that my car lasts until the Tesla, the quarter, about the cost of electricity.
[02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:12.380]   Cause I know a number of people electric cars who say, you know what?
[02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:14.380]   I'm paying through the nose.
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:15.900]   It's very expensive.
[02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:16.900]   Interesting.
[02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:17.900]   Yeah.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:20.780]   I don't know if you actually save money.
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:22.180]   Cause the utilities have wised up.
[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:23.940]   They say, oh, you're using a lot of wattage there.
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:26.900]   I think we're going to have to put you in a new tier.
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:27.900]   I didn't.
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:28.900]   Yeah.
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:29.900]   Interesting.
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:30.900]   I'd like to know more about that.
[02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:31.900]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:38.140]   Uh, so we've got three YouTube stars here and me, but I did interview a YouTube star
[02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:39.140]   last night.
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:45.380]   A little, a little group called Pomplamoose and that'll be airing next tomorrow, I guess
[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:47.700]   we'll release that as our triangulation for the day.
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:52.700]   And then Jeff, uh, pover of, uh, Vonage, the main fan of Vonage and an early advocate
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:56.860]   for voice on the internet, uh, we'll be part of, uh, we'll be on triangulation tomorrow.
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:08:59.180]   I got to, I got to do something even better than the Mercedes last.
[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:00.180]   What's that?
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:04.860]   I interviewed David Hall, the guy who builds the spinning thing on top of the Google self-driving
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:07.460]   car, the, uh, dine, Lidar.
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:08.460]   Yeah.
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:10.660]   And then our self-driving car uses his product.
[02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:11.660]   Wow.
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:12.660]   And he's a prequel.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:13.660]   The Lidar King.
[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:19.940]   And where we find those videos, uh, YouTube, YouTube somewhere, YouTube.com/scovalizer.
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:22.460]   You gotta work on the plug.
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:23.460]   These guys got it done.
[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:25.300]   You paid attention to that.
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:29.700]   Branding, you know, YouTube.com/theadazer, YouTube.com/building43.
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:30.700]   There you go.
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:31.700]   YouTube.com/rackspace.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:32.700]   So there you go.
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:33.700]   All right.
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:34.700]   Hey, did you, did you see any shows from this?
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:36.100]   We had some, we had some good show.
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:39.340]   What's, if you missed a little bit of Twitter this week, here's a little rundown of everything
[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:40.340]   you saw.
[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:41.340]   The new weaponized version.
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.340]   Previously.
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:43.340]   Yeah, there it is.
[02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:44.340]   Weaponized today.
[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:45.340]   And we're going to work on that.
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:46.700]   Will consumers understand the distinction?
[02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:50.460]   I mean, anonymous sounds anonymous, but in fact what you're doing is you're, you're,
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:52.540]   you're giving Facebook all the signals it wants.
[02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:56.260]   The vocal influencers will understand it and there's, they're the ones who would kill
[02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:57.700]   it if you didn't do it right.
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:09:58.700]   This week in law.
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:01.620]   Do we give our data to third parties?
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:03.300]   Are real and they are compelling.
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:10.140]   Because for most people, the biggest security risk is not the NSA or the Chinese government
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:12.260]   or cyber criminals.
[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:13.940]   It's, I lost this stuff.
[02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:14.940]   Yeah.
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:15.940]   This week in enterprise tech.
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:20.180]   Our second blip is all about a new zero day bug found in internet export.
[02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:25.620]   This one actually has the department of Homeland Security issuing a security alert to stop
[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:27.180]   using IE.
[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:28.180]   All about Android.
[02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:32.020]   Those that want to look at every single app we've ever featured on the show, you can
[02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:36.180]   go to wiki.twit.tv search for the all about Android wiki and you'll find the list in
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:37.180]   there to it.
[02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:39.500]   Thousands of hours of high quality dribble.
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.500]   I'm a huge loser.
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:47.940]   In 2011, I came in last 2013 Aaron Nukem beat me.
[02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:51.140]   Ooh, for Ron Richards.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:56.340]   And what's coming up next week, Mr. Mike Elgin of TNT fame.
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:59.820]   Coming up this week, TechCrunch disrupt hits New York tomorrow, May 5th.
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:03.220]   We also have a couple of mystery Google announcements to contend with.
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:07.380]   Google and Intel will unveil something about Chromebooks in the Chrome OS on Tuesday, May
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:08.380]   6th.
[02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:12.660]   And finally, Google has summoned Google Glass users to what they're calling a Glass Explorer
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:17.100]   celebration on Friday, May 9th at Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum.
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:20.980]   They accepted only the first 100 people who replied to the invite.
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:24.140]   The event is some kind of announcement, but nobody outside Google knows what it's all
[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:25.140]   about.
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:26.900]   And that's what's coming up this week.
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:27.900]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:11:27.900 --> 02:11:28.900]   Thank you, Mike.
[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:32.380]   I'm going to take a look at the
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:33.380]   last few weeks.
[02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:36.380]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:38.820]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.

[02:11:57.060 --> 02:11:59.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:01.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:03.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:05.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:08.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:11.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:14.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:16.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:18.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:20.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:22.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:24.060]   I'm going to take a look at the last few weeks.
