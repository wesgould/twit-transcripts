[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.920]   Time for Tweth this week at Tech.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.440]   The show we cover the week's tech news
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.320]   and what a week this has been.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.560]   But unfortunately we have a panel that is up
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.400]   to the task Erin Griffith is here
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.440]   from Fortune Magazine where she writes boom with a view.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.120]   Is that how you pronounce that?
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.960]   - Sure.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.800]   - Boom.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.880]   - I like the enthusiasm.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.520]   - You talk about the tech movement.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.240]   Of course you write a lot of feature stories
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.280]   about other subjects as well.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.800]   It's great to have you back.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.480]   You and your bike.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.320]   - Oh yeah.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.160]   - Yeah.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.000]   - Bikes.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.040]   - Bikes or Brooklyn bikes.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.160]   Also with us from, in fact I think we've got
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.080]   an all these coast team this week.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.240]   Steve Kovac is also here from Business Insider.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.960]   Do you live in Brooklyn Steve?
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.800]   - Manhattan.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.720]   - Manhattan.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.760]   Oh he's an urbanite.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.000]   Big city dweller.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.440]   - All right.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.160]   People who live in Petaloma as I do think of Brooklyn
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.380]   as pretty big city.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.460]   - It's huge.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.300]   - Huge.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.860]   - 2.5 million people.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.820]   - It's huge.
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.580]   Also David Pogue are you back east or you back here?
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.620]   You were by coastal I think.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.180]   - I am back east to the moment.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.020]   - Great.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.100]   So all of you will be staying up past your bedtime.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.940]   Welcome.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.460]   David Pogue with the Yahoo of course where he is
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.220]   a tech columnist for Yahoo Finance at Pogue
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.380]   and a long time friend of this show.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.900]   And it's always great to see you David.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.740]   Thank you.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.740]   - I've been tweeting a while.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.740]   - Thank you.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.740]   - Yeah.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.740]   - So I think that you won.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.740]   - Oh wow.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.740]   - A while.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.140]   So I think the big story this week was the Fridays DDoS
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.340]   distributed denial of service attack that slowed
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.940]   or brought down sites like Netflix and Twitter
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.620]   and GitHub and a lot of sites.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.860]   And I think the real story is that this attack
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.580]   was not your traditional DDoS.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.020]   It came from pretty much Internet of Things devices
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.580]   particularly Internet of Things devices
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.940]   by made by one Chinese manufacturer cameras and DVRs
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.060]   made by was it Xiang Mi and then branded by others.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.740]   The problem with these Internet of Things devices is
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.780]   they often have default passwords which can't be changed.
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.780]   And so bad guys scan the Internet for them.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.580]   This case the virus, there's a couple of viruses
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.580]   but this one was Mirai.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.620]   M-I-R-A-I.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.940]   It scans, it looks for the device, finds it,
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.700]   logs in with the default password, puts itself in memory.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.460]   And now you're on a botnet and your device, your camera,
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.500]   will be used to send false packets.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.660]   In this case to Dine DNS which is a DNS provider
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.260]   that apparently was used by these other sites
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.780]   and so brought them down.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.660]   Mirai is, well, according to Brian Krebs
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.580]   was originally written by somebody, a hacker with the handle
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.340]   on a senpai but on a senpai has released,
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.860]   was in the DDoS industry and writes,
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.580]   greets everybody when I first got in,
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.660]   go in DDoS industry, I wasn't planning on staying in it long.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.900]   I made my money, there's lots of eyes looking at IOT now.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.660]   So he or she released, it's time to GTFO, which you probably
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.180]   can figure out what that means.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.820]   So he or she released the source code from Mirai.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.580]   Brian Krebs posits that maybe the police were hot on her tail
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.060]   and so she preserved plausible deniability
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.220]   by making sure everybody else had the code.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.340]   So she could just say, oh, I don't know,
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.940]   I just downloaded this thing, I didn't write it.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.140]   Krebs was brought down last month with a 620 gigabit per second
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.140]   attack, such a nasty attack that he,
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.300]   was he on Akamai, his provider actually
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.580]   pulled the plug on his site.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.460]   But most of this came from generic routing encapsulation,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.260]   a particular kind of data packet used
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.420]   to direct, established direct P2P connection between network
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.660]   nodes from Internet of Things devices that
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.660]   had been hacked by Mirai.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.540]   Here's the worst news, even if you have been hacked
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.380]   and your service slows down, maybe that's
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.060]   why you keep getting knocked off air and I don't know.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.220]   Let's say you unplug that.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.180]   I wouldn't know it, right?
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.140]   You wouldn't know.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.780]   But let's say you said maybe and you unplug the device,
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.340]   but it's the virus is stored in RAM.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.660]   So you're off the botnet, but since you plug it in within minutes,
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.740]   you'll be reinfected.
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.780]   That's how bad it is.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.340]   So I'm just going to be responsible for this outage on Friday.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.860]   It's all your fault.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.980]   No, of course it's interesting that the company you
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.540]   who made a lot of these Internet of Things things
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.500]   is shong me because when I found out that both the New York
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.620]   Times and Spotify had been knocked off,
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.940]   that's exactly what I said.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.020]   Shong me!
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.460]   Me!
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.780]   Was the New York Times also down?
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.420]   I didn't know that.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.260]   Wow.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.860]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.020]   A lot of business insider was down too.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.020]   Was it?
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.940]   Yeah, we went down for a while.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.260]   I'm not sure I understand exactly that point.
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.540]   Why would one-- why would dying going down
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.820]   affect all these other sites?
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.100]   They're not customers of dying DNS.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.140]   I'm not exactly sure.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.340]   I just know that our IT guys were sending out frantic emails
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.260]   saying, it's not our fault, it's Dines' fault.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.700]   We're waiting for them to fix it.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.220]   Wow.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.380]   And I think it was only--
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.780]   And you didn't just see that.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.980]   What?
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.660]   Sorry.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.660]   I mean, it couldn't just be that whoever your web host is
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.220]   is a customer of Dine.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:32.580]   Maybe.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.380]   That's probably what it is.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.580]   Maybe, yeah.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.940]   We used for AWS.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.180]   Oh, AWS was brought down as well.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.620]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.540]   That's probably what it was, because we use AWS.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.100]   We use AWS, but we have a bunch of different interlocking
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.740]   things because we've been DDoS before.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.020]   In fact, we used AWS for DDoS protection.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.900]   The only real way to fight a denial of service attack
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.340]   is to just add more bandwidth.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.380]   Because you can't-- there's too many IP addresses to say,
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.620]   we'll block that camera, but then there's
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.620]   a 100,000 more somewhere else.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.940]   Here's the scary part.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.500]   According to Gartner, there are-- what was it?
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.980]   6.5 billion IoT devices in use this year.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.860]   And oh, I wish I don't have the number in front of me.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.180]   It was something like half a million more going on.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.700]   Let me see here.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.180]   I'll find it right here.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.620]   Gartner estimates that there are the 6.4 billion connected
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.980]   things worldwide, up 30%.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.980]   This is the one that scared me.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.540]   In 2016, 5 and 1/2 million new IoT devices
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.140]   are connected every day.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.220]   OK, I'd like to know what those are.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.180]   I mean, I've seen the Internet of Things-- water bottle,
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.100]   the Internet of Things, toilet paper, dispenser--
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.300]   That's what they are.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.420]   --is an Internet of Things dog dish display.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.500]   Even the things that make sort of sense,
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.900]   like an Internet of Things doorbell camera,
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.300]   I don't know anyone with those things.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.580]   You're telling these 6 billion people, I don't buy it.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.060]   What are we talking about here?
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.260]   Well, it's actually countable.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.700]   So I mean--
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.940]   Yeah, so your nest thermostat, there's a couple million there.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.060]   There's a lot of--
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.060]   Keep adding to the--
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.060]   Well, you have to--
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.060]   Yeah, you have to--
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.540]   How do you get a 6 billion out of that?
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.700]   All right, maybe Gartner's wrong.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.820]   I should have been more skeptical.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.500]   2 million thermostats you're saying,
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.900]   and all the rest are water bottles.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.460]   Well--
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.060]   And toothbrushes.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.940]   Most everything's connected now to the Internet.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.980]   Think of all those wemo and Belkin light switches,
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.700]   the hue lights--
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.940]   A lot of echoes.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.340]   The Amazon echoes, they've sold millions of those.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.100]   There's a lot of devices there.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.380]   The problem is, I'm sure the Amazon echo is fairly secure.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.060]   I'm sure Amazon knows what it's doing,
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.780]   and it doesn't have a default password which can't be changed,
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.540]   that the firmware gets updated by Amazon, one would hope.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.460]   What about TVs or TVs included in that?
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.220]   Because that would be huge.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:56.700]   Absolutely.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.060]   TV?
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.580]   Absolutely.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.060]   Absolutely.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.060]   That's not a massive smart TV.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.580]   Sure, anything that's connected to the Internet
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.940]   that's not a general purpose computer or a phone,
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.620]   I guess, would be an IoT device, right?
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.220]   Oh, OK.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.140]   Well, usually when people are hitting me up with PR pitches
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.500]   for an Internet of Things device,
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.940]   it's an ordinarily un-networked device
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.900]   that they have now added a phone app for,
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.700]   like a coffee maker or a refrigerator or--
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.660]   TV counts, right?
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.300]   I mean--
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.900]   OK, well, there you go.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.660]   TV wasn't connected to the Internet until recently.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.900]   What about phones?
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.500]   Does that count?
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.300]   No, I think that's a computer, right?
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.300]   Anyway, the real problem is with these cheap Internet
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.540]   of Things devices that are not designed with security
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.580]   in mind at all.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.980]   They're just being put online.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.620]   And I would bet you that every home has a couple or three
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.780]   of them, that you don't even-- the TV-- I've
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.540]   got how many TVs?
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.060]   Three TVs hooked up.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.500]   I've got--
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.700]   You can't buy a not smart TV anymore,
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.220]   if you like.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.140]   Every TV you buy is Netflix installed or whatever.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.220]   So that makes sense.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.460]   Cameras?
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.620]   Security cameras, spy cams.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.940]   They're a lot of-- but you're right.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.020]   That seems like a large number, five and a half million
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.180]   new ones a day.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.680]   Wow.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.260]   Not buying it.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.740]   You're not buying it?
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.740]   So let's say it's $1 billion, David.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.300]   Can you get behind $1 billion?
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.300]   Maybe if you include China and TVs.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.460]   Well, you have to.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.740]   You have to clue it all, right?
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.740]   Because all of these can be used maliciously,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.180]   if they don't have proper security.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.180]   And so are we--
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.580]   And so are we--
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.260]   Are we paying routers?
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.500]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.060]   Actually, we absolutely routers.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.100]   In fact, this has been a problem for some time.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.940]   Last Christmas, a year-- more than a year ago.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.980]   Remember when the Sony PlayStation network was brought
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.380]   down and the Xbox network was brought down on Christmas Day,
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.780]   it was brought down by the Lizard Squad using routers.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.780]   Hacked routers.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.780]   And the problem is companies are putting this stuff out
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.780]   and they're not patching it.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.780]   They're not keeping it up to date.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.780]   A router is such a cheap commoditized device
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.780]   that the companies don't update them.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.780]   Their attitude is, "Ah, you should buy a new one."
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.780]   I guess it really isn't much commentary on this,
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.780]   except that--
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.780]   Wow.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.780]   Terrell.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.780]   It's amazing.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.780]   There's just not a standard yet.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.780]   And it's amazing.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.780]   Apple is dipping their toe in.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.780]   They have their own standard.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.780]   Well, it's also-- there are so many standards, right?
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.780]   There's the HomeKit standard.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.780]   There's whatever Google has with Nest.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.780]   Wemo-- you name it.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.780]   There's a new standard of smart things.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.780]   So that makes sense.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.780]   Yeah, it's a big piece.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.780]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.780]   Right.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.780]   So I mean, that's the problem when it's just so fragmented
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.780]   that one of these is going to have a flaw or a hole in it
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.780]   that someone can exploit.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.780]   Are you playing pinball, Erin?
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.780]   I think somebody's trying to deliver a package for--
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.780]   Go ahead.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.780]   Go ahead.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.780]   Go ahead.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.780]   Go get it.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.780]   Don't problem.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.780]   No problem.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.780]   I like it.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.780]   You get Sunday night delivery in Brooklyn.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.780]   Man, I want to move there.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.780]   That is awesome.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.780]   That's Amazon Prime at work.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.780]   You know who it is.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.780]   They use the US Postal Service on the weekends.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.780]   Oh, really?
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.780]   The Postal Service trucks and many of their employees
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.780]   aren't working on Sunday,
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.780]   so they use contract employees,
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.780]   Postal Service trucks.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   So if you're getting Amazon deliveries on Sunday,
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.780]   often it's from the USPS, believe it or not.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.780]   Oh, thank you.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.780]   I think we've all learned something today.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.780]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.780]   [laughter]
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.780]   Well, I picked a bad starting topic.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.780]   I thought there'd be something to talk about,
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.780]   but as I think about it, besides the fact that, you know,
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.780]   what are all these devices,
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.780]   there really isn't that much to say, is there?
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.780]   I have a commentary.
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.780]   I have a commentary.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.780]   I have a commentary.
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.780]   This isn't something I cover super closely,
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.780]   but my question is, is this just an arms race
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.780]   that we will constantly be losing?
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.780]   Good question.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.780]   David, you have a thought?
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.780]   Yes, I have a commentary.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.780]   So part of it is you have the wrong guess.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.780]   None of us are security experts.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.780]   We all cover it, but we don't know it.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.780]   Right?
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.780]   We couldn't defend a government computer or hack into one.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.780]   Right.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.780]   But the thing that's so frustrating to me about this
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.780]   is almost any other problem in the world,
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.780]   there are steps we can take in progress that's being made.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.780]   Right?
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.780]   There are people attacking climate change,
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.780]   right?
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.780]   On the state level, moving to solar and greener programs.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.780]   With health, there are programs to dissuade you from smoking
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.780]   and getting more exercise.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.780]   Like every other problem in the world,
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.780]   but this one, like people ask me,
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.780]   and I'm like, I got nothing.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.780]   If Sony and Target,
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.780]   and the biggest, smartest companies in the world,
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.780]   with professional staffs,
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.780]   get hacked routinely,
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.780]   we have zero chance at our level.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.780]   Zero.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:47.780]   It's a problem.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.780]   The answer is we're screwed.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.780]   Is that why?
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.780]   Basically.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.780]   I have nothing to offer my readers.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.780]   I got nothing.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.780]   Well, there's nothing better.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.780]   No, it won't.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.780]   It's only going to get worse.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.780]   And it doesn't matter if you change your password and make it
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.780]   complicated and don't duplicate it.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.780]   It doesn't matter.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.780]   It'll still get stolen.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.780]   Well, because you also have these.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780]   Do you think, though,
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.780]   that any kind of regulation could,
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.780]   like, you know,
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.780]   forcing the companies that are making these cheap,
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.780]   kind of crappy connected devices to, like,
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.780]   go up to a certain standard?
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.780]   Do you think that would make a difference at all?
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.780]   Or is that just, like,
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.780]   already too little too late?
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.780]   No, it will make a difference.
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.780]   In fact, that's the,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.780]   I mean, there's a simple fix,
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.780]   which is to require that all of these devices have
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.780]   updateable firmware and that the companies are responsible
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.780]   for making sure that if they're, I mean,
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.780]   look, you can't make software without a flaw.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.780]   But if you look at the example of Microsoft,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.780]   Apple, Google,
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.780]   when the flaws are found,
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.780]   they patch these flaws.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.780]   So what should, what really is an issue is that
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.780]   companies are irresponsibly making devices that are
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.780]   A, not fixable and B, not being fixed.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.780]   So step one is to make sure that all devices can
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.780]   be updated and step two is to require companies,
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.780]   make somehow make companies responsible if they don't
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.780]   keep their devices secure.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.780]   I'm not sure it's a,
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.780]   it's a panacea, though.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.780]   I mean, that's- No, it's far from it.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.780]   That's a start, but I mean,
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.780]   my employer, Yahoo, you know, gave 500 million addresses
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.780]   to the government.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.780]   There was no hack there, but people were upset about that
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.780]   because the government wanted it and,
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.780]   and Target was an inside job by an employee, you know,
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.780]   no amount of good housekeeping and good protocols
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.780]   would have saved them.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.780]   You know, there's, it's always going to be a thing.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.780]   Right.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.780]   Well, it's never going to go away,
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.780]   but I think that there are things we should be doing to,
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.780]   to fight it.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.780]   I mean, I shouldn't just say, okay, throw up your hands or what,
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.780]   or just maybe don't have any Internet of Things devices anymore.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.780]   This is why we can't have nice things.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.780]   It's stuff, stuff cash in your mattress.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.780]   Stuff cash in your mattress.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.780]   Don't use banks.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.780]   Don't use anything.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.780]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.780]   No, I think it's all.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.780]   I think the problem is that here's,
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.780]   there's, it's problems twofold.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.780]   One, there's huge demand for the cheapest possible web cams
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.780]   and routers and all of that price driven down.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.780]   And then you have manufacturers all outside of the U.S. who are
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.780]   making cheap products.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.780]   That's, so problem one, we got to stop buying those and we got
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.780]   to start making rules about those.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.780]   That's not going to stop them being sold in other countries,
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.780]   right?
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.780]   And I don't think China is ever going to do anything about this.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.780]   So, and, and by the way, a Chinese device can bring down
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.780]   DNS, dying DNS just as easily as a U.S. device.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.780]   So in that sense, I don't know.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.780]   We'd have to have global regulation about this.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.780]   That doesn't seem likely.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.780]   No.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.780]   We're screwed.
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.780]   We can't even ignore the regulation for climate change.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.780]   We can't even figure that out.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.780]   You know, and we've seen this coming.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.780]   We've known this was going to be coming.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.780]   Brian Krebs wrote an article saying he's seeing, and others
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.780]   have noted this, probes from state actors into various
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.780]   infrastructure and internet infrastructure to see what the
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.780]   defenses are, what the security is.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.780]   He has anticipated, and I think he's right, we're going to see
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.780]   massive cyber attacks.
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.780]   You probably saw a couple of weeks ago and meet the press,
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:15.780]   Vice President Biden saying we're going to cyber attack Russia
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.780]   with a proportionate response to retaliate for their hacking the
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.780]   DNC.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.780]   This is not going to get worse.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.780]   That's, that's, that kind of commerce, that kind of dialogue
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.780]   escalates it, right?
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.780]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.780]   We're doing it too.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.780]   We're doing it just as much as China and Russia and Bulgaria or
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.780]   wherever it's coming from.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.780]   We're doing it just as bad to them as well.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:43.780]   So it's kind of like a cold war again in cyberspace or whatever.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.780]   David, you and I have been covering this for a long time.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.780]   And I think, I vividly remember in the mid 90s when the
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.780]   internet, you know, when Mosaic came out and then fire and
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.780]   death, Netscape and the internet became widespread use, kind of
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.780]   this met, this utopian sense that we're going to see the
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.780]   democratization of the world.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.780]   Everybody's going to be able to talk.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.780]   We're going to see an amazing thriving economy grow out of it.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.780]   I was very, and I'm sure you were too.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.780]   And I think we all were very almost utopian about this.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.780]   And it's turned into a dystopian in some ways, hasn't it?
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.780]   It's, it's both.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.780]   I mean, the, the good happened, but we didn't anticipate just how
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.780]   bad the bad would happen.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.780]   I mean, the bottom line is anyone who's been with the internet
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.780]   long enough, the bottom line is there are a lot of people who
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.780]   are really terrible people.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.780]   I mean, just not just the hackers, but the cyber bullies and the
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.780]   people who leave comments and.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.780]   Well, and, but, but that's what's interesting is this
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:48.780]   democratization is also given a bull horn to a tiny fraction.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.780]   I think most people are good.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.780]   Most people are not hacking IOT devices.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.780]   This is a small fraction, but all it takes is a small fraction
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.780]   because they are using the internet's leverage to have massive
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.780]   impact.
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.780]   That's right.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.780]   That's right.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.780]   That's terrible.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.780]   By the way, the more, the more we try to defend against it,
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.780]   the more complicated it gets.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.780]   So I was writing about this new feature of the Apple Watch that
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.780]   lets you unlock your laptop just by approaching it.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.780]   But to do that, you have to turn on two factor authentication.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:25.780]   Which if you can believe this is not the same thing as two step
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.780]   verification, which Apple asked last year.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.780]   So two factor authentication replaces two step verification.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.780]   Oh, Lord.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.780]   Like anyone is supposed to be able to understand any of this.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.780]   So I did it.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.780]   I get, well, first of all, you try to turn on two factor authentication
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.780]   and it says, I'm sorry, your iCloud address is not available
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.780]   for this feature yet.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.780]   Apparently they're rolling it out.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.780]   So Apple tech support escalated it and they agreed to turn it on
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:00.780]   for me, which was great, except that now everything disappeared
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.780]   from my calendar.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.780]   Because every program that taps into your iCloud account has
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.780]   to be updated with the two factor thing.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.780]   And I called Apple support and they didn't know.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.780]   They said, well, escalate it, but the guy won't be back until
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.780]   Monday.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.780]   So I decided I'll turn two factor authentication off.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.780]   And at that point, I was cut out completely from all iCloud
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.780]   services.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.780]   So at this moment, can I get texts?
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.780]   I cannot watch any of my movies or listen to my music or get
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.780]   into iCloud.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.780]   Nothing.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.780]   And of course, my calendar is blank.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.780]   So I mean, good protection comes with it.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.780]   Complication.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.780]   And we're going to see that happening more and more too.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.780]   The bigger, the more complex the defense is, the more inconvenient
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.780]   to be for the little guy.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.780]   If I may call myself.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.780]   My story is much better, but it's pretty bad still.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.780]   I wanted to do the same thing.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.780]   And then it said, OK, well, you have to answer your security
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.780]   questions, which good Lord, I don't remember what the questions,
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.780]   the answers were.
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.780]   I must have done this 10 years ago.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.780]   I hate security questions.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:05.780]   Couldn't figure it out.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.780]   So I called Apple and they said, oh, yes, no, it's not.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.780]   Of course, we'll reset your, we'll verify your identity.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.780]   They did.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.780]   They asked some other questions and verify my,
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.780]   they said, I reset my security questions.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.780]   Then I went back to turn on two factor and it said, oh, well,
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.780]   you've changed your account.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.780]   You can't turn on two factor for 30 days now.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.780]   I like it.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.780]   So, so in the process of setting up two factor, I actually
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.780]   disabled two factor, but now that I hear your story, David,
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.780]   I think I was blessed.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.780]   Wait, were you doing two step verification?
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.780]   I don't know.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.780]   I was turning on the new thing so I could unlock my gosh, darn
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.780]   Mac with my watch.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.780]   That's all I was trying to do.
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.780]   And I actually went online to research this to see what other
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.780]   journalists in the tech world have written about it.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.780]   And guess what?
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.780]   The tech people get the two terms confused.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.780]   I didn't know which one they were writing about.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.780]   What's the difference?
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.780]   Oh, there's a big difference.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.780]   One of them.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.780]   I can't remember.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.780]   So two steps.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.780]   So the idea of two factor is there are three, you need to
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.780]   authenticate yourself.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.780]   There's three ways to do it.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.780]   Something you know, something you have, something you are,
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.780]   something you are as biometrics, something you have as your phone,
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.780]   something you know as your password.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.780]   Two factor would be using two of those three, thereby making it
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.780]   harder for somebody to impersonate you.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.780]   Two step sounds like you have to know a password and a security
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.780]   and like the security questions.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.780]   That's two step.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.780]   It's not two factors.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.780]   Both of them are something you know.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.780]   Well, but both of these Apple things involved every time you try
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.780]   to use a new device or log in in a new browser or use a new Apple
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.780]   service, they would text you a six digit code, which you then
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.780]   must then, yeah.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.780]   So that's two factor.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.780]   Okay.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.780]   Well, that's, that's, I thought two step because that's having,
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.780]   that's something their password, which you already know.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.780]   That's something you won't know.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.780]   And then something you have, you have to have your smartphone
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.780]   for that to work.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   However, as we've learned, the weak link in all this is it's
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.780]   really trivial to impersonate somebody and take over their
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.780]   smartphone number.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.780]   So in fact, I just read an article by a security expert who
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.780]   said actually having a phone number attached to your Google
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:13.780]   account creates a security flaw because it's a matter of social
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.780]   engineering for a bad guy.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.780]   If they're targeting you, there you go.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.780]   If they're, if they're targeting you, they can call your phone
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.780]   company and say hello, this is Leo Laport.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.780]   They need to change my phone.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.780]   Can you send me a sim?
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.780]   And they send me a sim, send him a sim and now he has my phone
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.780]   number and can reset my Google account.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.780]   Wait a minute, so two factor authentication is complicated.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.780]   Is it is that is not the answer?
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.780]   It may get worse.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.780]   Well, and even the National Institute for Standards and
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:50.780]   Time NIST has issued a warning that text messages are not a good
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.780]   form of two factor.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.780]   And despite the fact that every bank, every financial institution,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:01.780]   Apple and Google all use it because SMS messages, that's a weak
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.780]   link.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.780]   How do you feel about fingerprints?
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.780]   Because the new laptop.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.780]   I like that.
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.780]   Supposedly the new MacBooks have a fingerprint reader just like
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.780]   the iPhone.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.780]   Yeah, that's a better way to go because that's something you are,
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.780]   right?
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.780]   Biometrics is something you are.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.780]   You're an iris or your fingerprint or, you know, the shape of
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.780]   your bottom, whatever it is.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.780]   That's something you are.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.780]   It's not looking.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.780]   None of this is perfect.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:29.780]   The idea is to have a speed bump.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.780]   So the hacker can get, okay, let's say I steal your target.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.780]   I get your password from your target account, but I still
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.780]   would need one more step.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.780]   By the way, as long as we're talking about this, had Colin
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.780]   Powell or John Podesta used two factor authentication on their
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.780]   Google account, they would not have been hacked.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.780]   Did you read?
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.780]   What year was those emails though?
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.780]   Was that very recent?
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.780]   This year.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.780]   Yeah, Podesta was, Podesta was in the last year.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.780]   It was all from this campaign.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.780]   This is a great article, by the way, from Vice, from Motherboard
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:07.780]   and Kudos to Lorenzo Franceski Bikari, who wrote it.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:13.780]   Now, I find this interesting, but apparently what happened is both
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.780]   Colin Powell and John Podesta got a message we've all gotten from
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.780]   Google or looking to be from Google.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.780]   Someone has your password.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.780]   Someone just used your password, signing your Google account,
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.780]   blue button, change password.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.780]   You click that.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.780]   It does not, of course, lead to gmail.com.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.780]   It leads to, well, it's a Bitly link.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.780]   And the reason we know this is they did not, they neglected to make it
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.780]   private.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.780]   You can have private Bitly links.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.780]   This Bitly link was clicked twice in March.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.780]   That's all.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:46.780]   By John Podesta twice, it was a link to, well, this looks pretty good.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.780]   Myaccount.google.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.780]   Oh, here's the problem.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.780]   com-securitysettingpage.tk.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.780]   That's the real URL.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.780]   But if you only, if you only stop at myaccount.google.com, you go,
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.780]   yeah, yeah, couple of, couple of warnings.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.780]   There's no HTTPS.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.780]   That tells you it's not really Google, but also you're going to
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.780]   com-securitysettingpage.tk.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.780]   When they clicked that link, it took them to a page that looked
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.780]   like a gmail account and they logged in.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.780]   Now had they had second factor, wouldn't have made any difference,
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.780]   right?
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.780]   Because you still need to get a text message.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.780]   The bad guy would have had to steal John Podesta's phone number
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.780]   or Colin Powell's phone number.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.780]   Again, not perfect, but a, but additional speed bump.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   So yeah, now we know how, uh, Podesta's email was hacked.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.780]   The interesting thing is, uh, this, this bitly account is tied to
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.780]   Fancy Bear.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.780]   I know you're happy to hear that.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.780]   Fancy Bear is, according to our intelligence agencies, a Russian
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.780]   state hacker.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.780]   But I'm thinking it's a little bit suspicious that Fancy Bear
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.780]   neglected to cover his tracks and didn't do the easiest thing
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.780]   possible, which is make this bitly account and this bitly link
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.780]   private.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:04.780]   So, hey, I, unlike some others, am not saying I know more than the
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.780]   seven U.S. intelligence agencies who have all concluded
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.780]   apparently that was Russians and probably they have other
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.780]   evidence.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:18.780]   But, uh, Fancy Bear left some, uh, breadcrumbs.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.780]   So turn on two factor, even if it's not perfect.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.780]   That gets, that's the point, even if it's not perfect, it's
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.780]   better than nothing.
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.780]   And, and I actually, whenever I write about fingerprints, I always
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.780]   get blasted on Twitter for suggesting that, that fingerprints
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.780]   are good, that the argument is always, yeah, but if somebody
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.780]   compromises your fingerprint and I don't know how that's supposed
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.780]   to happen and cut off your finger when you're sleeping, you
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.780]   can't change it.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.780]   Right.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.780]   Like you can a password.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:44.780]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.780]   A fingerprint is something, but you know what?
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.780]   I think a fingerprint's fine.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.780]   I really do.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.780]   I think the bigger, uh, the bigger issue for some people with
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.780]   fingerprints is that courts have held you could be forced to
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   give the law enforcement your fingerprint.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.780]   What's just happened a couple of weeks ago?
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.780]   Oh, right.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.780]   Like people are in jail and then they like make them unlock their
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.780]   phone so they can indict themselves, basically.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.780]   They, it's not, it's, it's not self incriminating, any more
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.780]   than it is to give a regular fingerprint or a straight of
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.780]   hair in the same way that telling them your password is
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.780]   self incriminating.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.780]   Courts seem to have agreed on that.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.780]   But, but recently the FBI, what was it?
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:31.780]   They wanted a warrant to march into somewhere and force people
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.780]   to unlock their phones.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.780]   The Department of Justice got a warrant specifically saying
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.780]   when you search these premises, you can then force, I think
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.780]   it was drug dealers, these drug dealers to unlock their
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.780]   phones that warrant said that there it is.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.780]   DOJ warrant to force people to use fingerprints.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.780]   Again, I think the motto of this show is we're screwed.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.780]   I was going to say Leo, do you have a?
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.780]   I got to get to tie.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.780]   I have to find something to her.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.780]   Let's take a break.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.780]   I'm going to search.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.780]   Oh my God.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.780]   This is terrible.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.780]   I'm depressed.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.780]   The cops have to wake up tomorrow with zero dollars in
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.780]   her bank account.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.780]   I know.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.780]   Wired magazine says there is a law enforcement database with
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.780]   117 million American faces in it.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.780]   What about half of all U.S. adults?
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.780]   This actually comes from the Center for Privacy and
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.780]   Technology at Georgetown University Law School.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.780]   And there's no restrictions on how they can use it.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.780]   It's widely available to national biometric database, mostly
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.780]   law-abiding people because it comes from driver's license
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.780]   photos.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:46.780]   And there's no real restrictions on how you can use it.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.780]   It's available to state and local level police.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.780]   So that wasn't the Cheery story that I was looking for, was it?
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.780]   Here's one that'll cheer you up.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.780]   Larry Lessig, I got to pat him on the back.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.780]   He's been on this show.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   Speaking of the Podesta emails, maybe you saw this.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.780]   Larry is a classy guy.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.780]   Law professor at Harvard.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.780]   He is the Creative Creative Commons.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.780]   Really smart fella.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:15.780]   He ran for president.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.780]   You may or may not remember this.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.780]   In this cycle, his plan was, he said nothing's ever going to
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.780]   happen unless we get campaign finance reform.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.780]   But no incumbent is ever going to support campaigns finance
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.780]   reform because that's how they get the money to become the
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.780]   incumbent.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.780]   So I'm going to run for president.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.780]   I'm going to pick a really good vice president.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.780]   When I get elected, I am going to initiate campaign finance
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.780]   reform.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.780]   As soon as it's done, I'll resign, let the really good vice
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.780]   president run the country.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.780]   All fixed.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.780]   Didn't work, obviously.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.780]   But apparently it was bad enough to annoy John Podesta, the
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.780]   Clinton campaign chairman, who referred to the smugness of Larry
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.780]   Lessig, and then in a email correspondence with Nira
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.780]   and then you're a responded.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.780]   I effing hate that guy.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.780]   She's talking about Lessig.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.780]   Like, I'd like to kick the crap out of him on Twitter, but I
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.780]   know that's dumb.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.780]   This was leaked.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.780]   Lessig, who could reasonably have taken Umbridge, instead
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.780]   posted on his blog, "I'm on my way from Iceland to my parents
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.780]   to see my dad.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.780]   He's not doing well.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:21.780]   Sorry, Larry."
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.780]   Laning in JFK, my inbox flooded with questions about this
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.780]   leak.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.780]   Here's a single and my only response.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.780]   I'm a big believer in leaks for the public interest.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.780]   That's why I support Snowden and why I believe the president
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.780]   should pardon him.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.780]   But I can't for the life of me see the public good in a leak
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.780]   like this, at least one that reveals no crime or violation of
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.780]   any important public policy.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   We all does.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.780]   He's arguing for the privacy of the two people who slimed him.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.780]   We all deserve privacy.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.780]   The burdens of public service are insane enough without the
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.780]   perpetual threat that every thought shared with a friend becomes
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.780]   Twitter fodder.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.780]   Nira has only ever served in the public and public interest
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.780]   sector.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.780]   Her work has always and only been devoted to advancing her
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.780]   vision of the public good.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.780]   It's not right.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.780]   She should bear the burden of this sort of breach.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:10.780]   He basically apologized to her for the leak.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.780]   Now, is that it up?
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.780]   Beat enough?
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.780]   No.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.780]   Now you're just saying that none of our emails are ever going to
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.780]   be secured either.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.780]   Nothing safe, my friend.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.780]   All utterances are public, whether you think so or no so or not.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.780]   Maybe Scott McNeely had something there when he said privacy is
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.780]   over.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.780]   Get over it.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.780]   God, I'm so sorry.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.780]   Look, let's talk about -- we've got a happier thing.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.780]   There's an Apple event coming up on Thursday.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.780]   Are you flying out for that, David?
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.780]   I am.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.780]   All right.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.780]   So we'll get some speculation on that.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   It's funny, Microsoft, knowing that there would be an Apple
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.780]   event in October, but not knowing the date because Apple -- I
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   think kind of mean-spiritedly won't tell anybody to the week
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.780]   before forcing you to buy the most expensive ticket possible.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.780]   They're doing an event in New York.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.780]   They're having a satellite thing here.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:00.780]   Apple is?
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.780]   I'm staying here.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.780]   Oh, you could stay there.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.780]   I didn't know.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.780]   That's nice.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.780]   But Microsoft says we want to have an event too.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.780]   We've got new hardware to announce.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.780]   Last thing we want to do is announce the same day Apple does.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.780]   That's the kiss of death or even the day after because they're going
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.780]   to own the news cycle for a while.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.780]   And they didn't know.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.780]   So they just threw a pin in the calendar, the dart at the
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.780]   calendar.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   And they said, "Will Apple moved?
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:30.780]   It's quarterly analyst call from Thursday to Tuesday."
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.780]   So probably that means Thursday is the event.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.780]   So we're going to do our event on Wednesday.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.780]   So Microsoft's event on Wednesday.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.780]   And when Apple said the invitation, they went, "Whew, we
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.780]   got it right."
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.780]   So we can talk about that.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   That makes me really sad.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   I feel like Microsoft should just stop trying to plan their
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.780]   lives around Apple.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.780]   I think they should be able to.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.780]   But realistically, don't you think that that's...
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.780]   With the whole narrative of Apple is losing its fizzle,
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.780]   though, couldn't Microsoft kind of usurp them with something
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.780]   really exciting?
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.780]   That's harder to do than just moving the date.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.780]   You do it before.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.780]   You rush to beat Apple's announcement at your peril.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.780]   As we have learned.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.780]   Samsung.
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.780]   Samsung raced to get the Note 7 into the marketplace before the
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.780]   iPhone 7 announcement.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.780]   And that plan sort of blew up on them.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.780]   Not good.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.780]   What's your take on that?
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:33.780]   Do you think that Samsung did something really wrong?
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.780]   What happened there?
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.780]   So I actually, although I'm a terrible security expert for your
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   first segment, I'm a very good exploding battery guy.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.780]   Because for a year now, I have been traveling with Nova,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.780]   the PBS science show I sometimes host, making a special called
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.780]   The Search for the Super Battery, about batteries.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.780]   Oh.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.780]   Batteries are so...
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.780]   I mean, they're not like double A's for our toys anymore.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.780]   And they're not even just our gadgets.
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.780]   Batteries are the key to everything.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.780]   I mean, electric cars, of course, but the grid.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.780]   Like everyone says, "Oh, there'll be solar and there'll be wind."
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.780]   But what you don't understand is that...
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.780]   You got a store...
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.780]   Solar and wind.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.780]   There's no electricity from the wall when that's not shining or blowing.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.780]   Right.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.780]   You got a store?
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.780]   It's not like a faucet where the water's just waiting for you to turn it on.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.780]   Electricity when you turn a lamp on is generated now.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.780]   Let's take a break.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.780]   We're going to talk about that when we come back and talk about the Microsoft event.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.780]   First, I have to talk about my new luggage with...
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.780]   A battery in it.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.780]   Oh.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.780]   No, this is a good battery.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.780]   This is the away luggage.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.780]   It's actually really nice, high quality, smart suitcase.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.780]   It starts at $225.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:45.780]   They have a carry-on.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.780]   That's what this is.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.780]   The medium and the large.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.780]   It's all under $300.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.780]   But I love this.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.780]   If you look under the...
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.780]   First of all, it's a four-way roller, which I don't buy bags now that aren't four-way.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.780]   You got to have four wheels.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.780]   They call them spinners, right?
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.780]   And it's so much easier.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.780]   You walk into the airport and you just roll it in.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.780]   But also, look under the handle.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.780]   There's two USB ports, a USB 3, USB 2 charging port.
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.780]   And a little 10,000 mAh battery in here.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.780]   It doesn't really add to the way, which is nice.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.780]   It's a very lightweight luggage.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   So that...
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.780]   I mean, how many times you see people searching for a plug at the airport?
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.780]   And how often do you find it?
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.780]   And if you find it, how many times are there 18 other people plugged into that same plug?
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   Now you got...
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.780]   Don't show anybody, but you got your own charger right here.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.780]   TSA approved combination lock, of course, to prevent theft.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:38.780]   And patent pending interior compression system, and I really like, that really saves you space.
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:45.780]   You can get a week or two even worth of clothes in this with the compression system and still carry it on.
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   And any professional traveler knows the only way to fly is carry on.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.780]   You do not want to check baggage of any kind.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:59.780]   So the compression system means you can over pack and fit it all in without having to sit on your luggage.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.780]   There is inside a removable laundry bag.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.780]   Said that's washable so you can keep your dirty clothes in there.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.780]   This is a really, really nice luggage lifetime warranty.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:15.780]   And, as with a lot of the stuff we saw on the internet these days, a 100 day trial period, I think that's great.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.780]   You can return it after any time in the 100 days and get your money back.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.780]   A way as a special offer, just for you, just for you, Twit listeners, $20 off your order.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:30.780]   If you go to awaytravel.com/twit and use the promo code TWIT at checkout.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.780]   And it's, as I said, risk free for 100 days.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.780]   If at any time you say, "Yeah, it's not for me."

[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.780]   So there's no risk.

[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.780]   Use the promo code TWIT at checkout for $20 off your order.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:52.780]   This is the only bag I carry now because I don't, I, now a days phones just don't get through it today.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.780]   And I also now have to charge my headphones too.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:05.780]   And my watch, you need a battery everywhere you go, as David was saying, awaytravel.com/twit.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.780]   We thank him for their support of this week in tech.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.780]   So you, you're lucky.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:16.780]   So has Apple done this before with a satellite event, Stephen, so that you don't have to go to California?
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.780]   I think so, or at least not recently.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.780]   I don't remember them yet.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.780]   I mean, we, we just watch the stream.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.780]   I'm really glad Apple streams it now.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:30.780]   Yeah, I'm going to watch the stream and then they have like a little showcase thingy somewhere else here in the city.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   And that's the reason there's two reasons to go to an event, one to see all your buddies like David.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.780]   Right.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.780]   And the other to touch the stuff.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:37.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.780]   So that's, I saved myself a trip across the country this week.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   So David, you, you probably already have it.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.780]   So what is it?
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.780]   Oh, he's on it right now.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.780]   You're using it right now, aren't you?
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.780]   It's called Siri thought recognition.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:58.780]   And, no, I know nothing more than you do other than the rumors.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.780]   It's, it's new Max.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:06.780]   Yeah, I'm excited actually because it's been over a year since we've had the new MacBook Pro.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.780]   More than that.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.780]   Yeah, long time, right?
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.780]   We're due.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.780]   It's been a couple of years since they really significantly did anything with the Pro.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:20.780]   Surprisingly, Ming Chico who usually is pretty good on this stuff, he's at KGI securities.
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.780]   I think because he has access to the supply chain, right?
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.780]   You're never going to get anybody in Cupertino to tell you nothing.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.780]   But how is Apple going to manufacture this stuff in China without somebody saying something?
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:38.780]   So he says Apple will have a new MacBook as well.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.780]   That's the thin one.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.780]   That they are dumping the MacBook Air, which kind of makes sense.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.780]   The MacBook, really?
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:48.780]   You're not happy about that?
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   I live on the MacBook Air.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.780]   Well, I think the idea is that the MacBook replaces the Air, they're going to have a new 13 inch MacBook.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.780]   And I need my jacks.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.780]   I can't, I can't get by one jack.
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.780]   I know, I don't like that.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.780]   And I also own four of the power adapters.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.780]   I'm not buying four more E-dollar power adapters.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.780]   Yes, you are, David.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.780]   No, I'm not.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.780]   How many headphone adapters did you buy?
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.780]   I bought four just so I wouldn't run out.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.780]   Right?
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.780]   They're only nine bucks.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.780]   Can I tell you my brilliant idea?
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.780]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.780]   This is totally off topic.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.780]   So Apple has their AirPods, right?
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.780]   And no one's been allowed to review them yet because they're not out yet.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.780]   But in principle, they seem like a great solution.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.780]   They work for your phone, they switch seamlessly to your Mac.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.780]   The only time you're screwed when you have those wireless headphones, earbuds of any type,
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:48.780]   is when it's like the airline seat back or your car or you have a jack.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:59.780]   So why does an Apple or somebody sell a button, a little transmitter button that snaps into any jack you ever find and transmits to your AirPods?
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.780]   Is that not brilliant?
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:02.780]   That's actually a good idea.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.780]   Therefore, you never are caught out ever anywhere you go.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:12.780]   And it could have all the different jack configurations for however you have to do it.
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.780]   There is a business opportunity for them.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.780]   That's a good idea.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.780]   Somebody Griffin could do that.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.780]   It's a good idea.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.780]   It's just a Bluetooth dongle really, the transmitter, right?
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:22.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:29.780]   And some people have the AirPods because I've seen people review, but they always say it's a pre-production.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.780]   You have a pre-production unit, right?
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.780]   These are the pre-production unit right here.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:34.780]   Oh, let me see.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.780]   There they are.
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:36.780]   Show off.
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.780]   You're allowed to show those?
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.780]   Oh.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:47.780]   So my understanding is the same hardware is in the AirPods that they sell, the wired AirPods they sell.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.780]   So the sound shouldn't be better.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:50.780]   Is it better?
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:54.780]   Yeah, it sounds almost the same as the ones that come with the wired ones.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.780]   Yeah, about the same.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:01.780]   Yeah, but at that price it should be, I mean, that seems like it's a premium price headphone.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:02.780]   Yeah, it's, what is it?
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.780]   I forgot what it is, 150, right?
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.780]   Yeah, 140, 160.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.780]   160.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.780]   160.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.780]   Geez.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:15.020]   But I got to tell you, since I guess we're allowed to talk about it, I also have been using
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.020]   impaired the pre-production.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.020]   Oh, wow.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.900]   You, we caught you.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.300]   You said no one had them.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.780]   No one, no one has the real ones.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.780]   Oh, the real ones.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.780]   I thought I had to speak.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.380]   I actually don't review pre-production because you don't know what it's going to be like when
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.940]   it comes out.
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.260]   But I think this is pretty close probably, right?
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:37.140]   And pre-production, and by the way, I was among the ones who mocked these things when
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.140]   they were announced.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.060]   Well, you look like you're, you look like your ears dribbling something.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.900]   Like, like you got something coming out of your ear.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.260]   I don't like that look.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.420]   But you know what?
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.660]   I am, I am a convert.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.780]   So the whole thing about you pull it out of your ear and your music or your movie stops.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.780]   That's smart.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.860]   I mean, it's brilliant.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.220]   So, oh yes, I'll have the sirloin.
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.220]   Thank you.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.780]   You know, and then you put it back and it continues.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.780]   Brilliant.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.820]   And Phil Schiller said something weird at the Apple event.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:11.300]   He's like, and if you use one at a time, that's 10 hours of playback charge per thing.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.660]   I'm like, why are you counting it like that?
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.820]   And I realized it's actually great to listen to just one.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.500]   Like you're on a plane, you're on a job.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   I mean, it's long enough.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.940]   For music, but for books or for speaking on a phone.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.660]   For watching YouTube videos and...
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.660]   All right.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.660]   Mono content.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.660]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.620]   Because that way you're still clued into the world around you.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:35.500]   And then of course you put them back into the dental floss box and they have 24 more hours
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.500]   of charge to them.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:37.500]   So when are these going to be out?
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.500]   They said this month.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.940]   I bet on Thursday that they say it's on sale.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.500]   We're running out of October, aren't we?
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.500]   It's not me.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.460]   They waited until the last possible minute for all of this.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.380]   My guess is there's brilliant AirPods.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.940]   We told you about last month they're on sale today.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.940]   Right.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.940]   You know, something like that.
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:55.940]   Right.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.500]   Well, the MacBooks, the new MacBook, the MacBook Pros, will those be on sale pretty quickly?
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.500]   Why they have to be if you're going to get them to the market?
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.500]   Probably.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.540]   I imagine with the next week or two.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.580]   So and Aaron, do you have AirPods too?
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.340]   Am I the only one who doesn't have them?
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.340]   No, I'm not.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.500]   I'm not a gadget reviewer.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.500]   All right.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.140]   I pretty much don't write about all of the announcements.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.620]   I'm more of a corporate narrative person.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:25.780]   So I'll talk about how this changes the future of listening or something.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.900]   They're not sending them to me.
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.500]   Well, Steve, Steve, are you a gadget person?
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.500]   Yeah, I do all the reviews for VIA.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.500]   Okay.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.300]   So that means you're, I don't know.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.300]   Good.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   All right.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.020]   The thing that bothers me about them though is the volume control.
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.460]   So you know, on the wired headphones, you have that little dongle where you can, you
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:50.580]   know, answer the phone or adjust the volume or switch tracks or pause and play with these.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.580]   You can't do that.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.580]   You have to use Siri for everything.
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.980]   So if I want to turn up the volume, I have to tap it.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.980]   It really activates.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:00.500]   And then I say, my music pauses.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.180]   And then I say, raise the volume or lower the volume.
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:07.540]   And then my music resumes, which is just a terrible experience.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.740]   I think they really mess that one up.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:14.340]   You're not like if you're running or like your hands are occupied.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.380]   It's a, it's a very awkward.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.780]   Well, frankly, Siri is not always responsive.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:20.980]   I mean, how often do you get?
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:21.980]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.980]   I can't connect to the network.
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.820]   And does that mean I'm not going to be able to turn my headphones down because I can't
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.820]   hear the volume.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:28.820]   What do I do on a plane?
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.820]   You have to take one out.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.900]   You have to take one out or you press it on the phone, the volume control.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.900]   Oh, okay.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.900]   So you can't do it there.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.900]   But if you're done, okay, that's fine.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.580]   Then I, I could live with that.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.060]   And of course everybody said you're going to lose them.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.740]   I don't know if you're going to lose them.
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.740]   160 bucks.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:45.740]   I haven't lost mine.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.740]   I haven't lost mine yet.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:47.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:48.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.740]   I don't think you are.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.740]   I think that's overblown.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:55.180]   As a matter of fact, I noticed that it takes me less time to get these things in and out
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:59.580]   of my laptop bag and into my ears and getting going, then it does to pull out the traditional
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.220]   earbud cord that I have to untangle and plug into things.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.220]   Yes.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.220]   No, I agree with you.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.700]   Untangling a headphone cord should be a thing of the past.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.780]   Well, I actually think the price point is, is good in that way because like when you
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.980]   buy a crappy pair of sunglasses, you're, you're inevitably going to sit on them or leave them
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.980]   somewhere.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.420]   But if you have a really nice expensive pair, you're going to bring the case along with you
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.420]   wherever you go and like make sure that you remember them and you don't put them on your
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.420]   head and stretch them out.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.940]   Like, I actually think that people will take a little extra care because of how expensive
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.940]   they are.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.940]   How's the microphone sound?
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.940]   When you make phone calls as a sound, there are people.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.100]   It sounds totally normal.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:42.020]   And what's interesting is that these air pods for the first time make it possible to do
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.980]   phone calls with the Apple Watch, which I'm not a fan of.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.500]   I don't own one, but I mean, right now you can make phone calls with it by holding it
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.220]   up to your head like an idiot.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.900]   But now at least you can walk down the street with the air pods communicating with the watch,
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.900]   communicating with the phone.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   Okay.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:04.180]   So new, new Mac book, 13 inch MacBook Pro, 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.180]   We're to see the arrival of Thunderbolt three, which makes sense.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:14.700]   The new Intel chipsets, the newer Intel chipsets support those.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:21.020]   Ming Chi Quosang Skylake, even though KB Lake is imminent, better resolution.
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:24.420]   The biggest change will be, of course, the OLED touch bar, right?
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   Which I like.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.420]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:34.220]   Replacing the function key row with a programmable screen means that your apps, your applications
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.980]   can have custom function keys.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.980]   I like that idea.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:38.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:40.220]   That just makes sense too.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.860]   How old are the function keys to it?
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.100]   I mean, who uses F1, F2, maybe some, you know, Photoshop nerds or something?
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:52.820]   It'll be interesting to see how that adapts and how easy it is for developers to make
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.420]   it change for what you need to do.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:00.060]   Quo does say that don't expect the new 5K cinema display.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:07.460]   That will be next year, new iMacs next year, and is notably silent on any Mac Pro.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.940]   The Mac Pro is, of course, really superannuated.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.580]   It's three years old now.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.580]   I bet you know.
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.340]   I'm how many people own Mac Pros?
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.340]   Nobody buys that thing.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:21.780]   I mean, like, you know, high-end video editors and, yeah, okay, you have one.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.780]   We have a better office.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.740]   Our video team has them, but I mean, like, normal people.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.060]   No, I actually gave mine away.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.060]   Oh.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:34.380]   I know I get on Christmas list.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.380]   Just be on the show.
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.740]   You gave away my $10,000 computer.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.460]   Well, yeah, I didn't want it.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:41.220]   I gave it to some poor guy who works for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.380]   How much money could he have?
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.460]   No, I gave it to Nathan Oliveris Giles.
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:47.620]   He said, "Boy, really?"
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.300]   Yeah, well, he said, "I really want a Mac Pro for editing."
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.940]   He's doing a lot more video editing.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:57.340]   I said, "Mine is literally a doorstop, literally holding the door open in my office."
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:01.780]   So you would be doing me a favor if you would just take it off my hands.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.820]   You're just swimming in expensive gadgets.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.300]   But that's my job, right?
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.700]   That's what I'm supposed to do is buy and try so you don't have to.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.820]   I think I was pretty clear from day one, you should not get the new Mac Pro.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:22.380]   Apparently, Apple feels the same way because they haven't updated it.
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:25.420]   It's completely un-upgradable.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.620]   It's just the way it is.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.300]   It's just a perfect little snowflake.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.220]   All right, Apple event.
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:38.500]   Apparently, Microsoft event the day before will also be new Surface hardware.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.980]   Not sure exactly what.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.980]   It's the All-in-One.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.860]   It's their iMac competitor.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.940]   You think that's what they'll do?
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.940]   Is it iMac?
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.100]   Yeah, that's what it sounds like.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:53.020]   It sounds like even the Surface Pro and the Surface Book won't really get a big update
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.180]   if at all.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.860]   It's not going to be like the Surface Pro 5.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:02.980]   It's just going to be this All-in-One Windows 10 version of the iMac.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.860]   And I guess we probably won't see any more Windows phones.
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.860]   That's toast.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   They're done with it.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.420]   I think you probably pretty sure of that.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:12.380]   I like the idea of an All-in-One.
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:15.580]   Other Windows OEMs, of course, make All-in-ones.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.340]   But Microsoft does not yet make one.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.740]   And they've really entered in a hardware in a big way.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:25.580]   I have a Surface Book and I like it a lot once it got the proper firmware upgrades to
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.220]   fix it had a myriad of problems.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.580]   Apparently, associated with a Skylake processor.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.940]   Microsoft said it was a hard computer science problem.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.820]   It took six months to get it working.
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.820]   But they did.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.100]   All right.
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.460]   And we'll be covering, I should mention, both those events.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:50.140]   I'll be up very early West Coast time, 7 AM on Wednesday to cover the Microsoft event.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:54.860]   And then I think the Apple event is 10 AM Pacific the following day.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.780]   We'll obviously be covering that.
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:00.220]   Did that cheer anybody up?
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.020]   Are we feeling a little better now?
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.020]   No hardware?
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.020]   Happier.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.020]   Happier.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:09.700]   Okay, well, I can bring you down more than 90% of genuine Apple chargers and cables sold
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:14.020]   on Amazon are fake.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.700]   I can bring you down in any circumstance.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.820]   Trust me.
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.980]   Apple's filed trademark infringement cases against Mobile Star LLC.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.900]   They're the primary maker of these counterfeit products.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:31.100]   They're using the made for iPhone logo and everything.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.980]   Apple says they're not only illegally using the trademark, but the fake chargers get
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:42.660]   this in this day and age have not passed safety tests and pose a risk to consumers.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:46.540]   So you thought you were safe once you turned in your note seven.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:50.940]   Did they say what the risk is?
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:56.660]   I don't think it's going to blow the phone up, but a bad charger can be a problem, right?
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.660]   We have seen.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:04.300]   Remember there was a iPhone a couple of years ago that caught on fire in China and Apple
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:09.780]   said it was almost certainly the third party charger that was not spent.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:18.540]   If you're buying a, if you're buying a, a, a, a, a charger on Amazon and it's not from
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.580]   Apple the store, can't you, shouldn't you just assume that it's counterfeit?
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:27.220]   No, because Apple has this made for iPhone thing.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.100]   MFI certification.
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:35.780]   And I've always said, you know, I agree with you and don't buy anything that isn't MFI,
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:40.420]   but if it has the MFI label on Amazon, that should be safe.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.540]   Well, apparently not.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.540]   They're fake.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:44.420]   It's a fake MFI logo.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.500]   But the, the Amazon basic stuff is fine.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:47.500]   Right.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.340]   I use, I've bought those lightning chargers before and they're great.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.740]   They're like six bucks and more like a third of the price.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.220]   Do they sink as well as charge me to do everything or is it just, they're just charge.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:59.060]   I have it at my desk at work, you know, for my secondary charger.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.020]   But I've always been happy with Amazon basic stuff.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:04.340]   I would think if it's from Amazon, it would be safe.
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:09.780]   You know, under the skin, this is exactly the same conversation as the one we started with.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.780]   The IOT problem.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.540]   It can't just last anything.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.380]   Things that you thought were okay are really not.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:22.660]   Your email is not private and never will be your, your Apple branded chargers are really
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.460]   fakes and will blow you up.
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.860]   I mean, you're just taking away everything we used to believe in.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:28.860]   Oh, sorry.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.860]   I'm so sorry.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.780]   I didn't want this to be a downer, man.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:38.580]   Doesn't anyone have a story about someone giving laptops to children in Africa or something?
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.580]   Please.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.580]   No, nobody does that anymore.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.580]   We tried that.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:43.580]   Damn it.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.580]   There's a, there's a new Pixel phone.
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:46.580]   We'll talk about that.
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.300]   The Google phone is now out.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.820]   Did you, did you guys review it?
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:52.820]   Did you, you reviewed it?
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:55.820]   All right.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.820]   We'll talk.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:57.820]   Hold on a second.
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:02.460]   I guess the Google home should be coming out in a week or two.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.460]   Google did change.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:10.220]   I thought, and this is from ProPublica, how they handle your web tracking information in
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.460]   a way that is a little worrisome.
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:16.900]   So we'll, we'll bring that up a whole lot more still to come.
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.220]   And I'm sorry I've depressed everybody.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.900]   Aaron Griffith is here from, of course, from fortune.com.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.300]   We love Aaron.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.100]   Steve Kovac from Business Insider.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.220]   Always a pleasure to have you.
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:35.020]   David Pogue, he's a columnist, writer, senior editor at Yahoo for the tech section in Yahoo
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:36.020]   Finance.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.020]   What?
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.020]   All of the above.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:43.420]   You know, yeah, columnist tech critic, something like that.
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:46.100]   What we haven't talked about yet, and I bet you'll have something to say about this, is
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:52.660]   the massive $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.980]   That's going to be an interesting story too.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.980]   We'll get to that in a second.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.780]   We're in my Saturday night last night.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:57.780]   I bet it did.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:58.780]   Why did they do that on the weekend?
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.780]   Why did they announce those things on a weekend?
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:05.100]   They rushed the deal because it leaked out and they wanted to avoid competition.
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.100]   Yep.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:09.540]   Don't want anybody else coming along with more.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.460]   They may regret that.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:16.260]   They may live to say, gosh, why do we buy Time Warner?
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:17.260]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.580]   Let me talk about razors first.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:24.900]   You wrote a good article about the, you asked the question, Aaron, is the, is the razor business
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:25.900]   a tech business?
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.500]   Obviously, razors are not high tech.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:33.020]   What's interesting to me, and a lot of our sponsors are like this, is that they're using
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:38.940]   the internet and technology to kind of disintermediate to eliminate the middleman in businesses to
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.580]   sell direct.
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.980]   Harry's is a really great example.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:47.860]   They bought the factory in Germany that makes the best razor blades.
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:51.860]   Instead of going through a drug store and getting 100% markup, they sell them direct
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:55.100]   to you at about half the price that you would pay at the drug store.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:59.060]   When I've been using Harry's, gosh, when do we start doing this?
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.060]   I mean, it's been at least a couple of years.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:08.060]   It's for people who want a great shave experience for a fraction of the price.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:11.940]   By the way, one of the things I love about Harry's, they're always improving their product.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.420]   They don't raise the price.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.620]   They just, they, they, little improvements that make a big difference.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:19.820]   This is the Harry's Truman set, which is a great deal.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.700]   I'm going to give you even better deal in a second, but you get the razor handle.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.860]   You get the three blades that travel cover a full size foaming shave, gel or the shave
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:28.860]   cream.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:29.860]   But look at these.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:32.620]   They've, they've, they've, they've, they've at, whoops, I just took the blade off.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.420]   They've added to the, the blades.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:39.980]   Now they have a fifth blade in the back here, the, the, which I always missed on the Harry's
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.140]   and I'm really glad they added these because there's a little spot under my nose.
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.580]   I can't reach.
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.860]   They've got the lubricating strips are even better with better.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.980]   They just last and they're really helping get a smooth shave.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.940]   The flexible hinge has been improved.
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:59.420]   Still $2 a blade, half what you pay at the drugstore by owning the factory.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:04.340]   Harry's can produce high quality razors and sell them for half the price.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:05.860]   I want you to check it out.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:10.420]   In fact, Harry's is so confident that you're going to love their blades.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.900]   They're going to send you a free trial set.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:19.540]   That's the razor, a five blade cartridge and shaving gel free when you sign up for a
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:20.540]   shave plan.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:26.220]   The shave plan means you'll always get a fresh blades and fresh shaving gel or shaving cream
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.820]   has shipped directly to your door every month or every two months, depending on your, on
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.700]   your need.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:35.180]   And when you're, because you're a fan of the show, you're going to get a bottle of Harry's
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:38.260]   post shave bomb added to your order for free.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.940]   Well, this gets better and better.
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.860]   I love how this Harry's post, post shave bomb smells.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.300]   That's really nice way to soothe your skin after your shave.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:49.460]   So go to harries.com right now.
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:59:04.660]   It's a little bit of a
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:11.660]   little bit of a
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:18.660]   little bit of a
