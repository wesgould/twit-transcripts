[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.520]   to listen in on a butt dial,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.400]   and how to kill a Jeep on a highway.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.600]   It's all coming up next on "Twit."

[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.480]   It's time for "Twit" this week in Tech,
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.240]   the show where we cover the week's tech news
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.640]   in awesome, obsessive detail.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.080]   Alex Wilhelm is here.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   I am indeed drinking tang and tequila.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.960]   Fancy and tequila.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.040]   Oh, tang and tequila would be more illiterate.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.760]   Unfortunately, your office didn't have tang,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.920]   so I'm scraping the bottom of the twit barrel, if you will.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.200]   Again, I wanted to James and Rox,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.080]   but unfortunately your bar has failed me.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.200]   So I shall fail you instead.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   No, don't fail us.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.280]   Alex is at TechCrunch and he bought his Twitter handle
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.320]   in 1989 from a Mexican fellow.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.840]   That's what I was born actually, well done.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.680]   Oh.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.520]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.680]   All right, your mom did.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.040]   'Cause she said I want him, someday there will be
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.360]   a social network called Twitter.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.960]   Well, more of a proto Twitter at that point in time,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   kind of way back in the Stone Ages of technology.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.200]   If you're in 1989.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.040]   You were born in what makes you 22?
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.480]   That makes you 26 years old.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.520]   As of years ago, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.560]   Oh, you're just a child.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.120]   I am just speaking of children.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.680]   Tim Stevens is also here.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.520]   Great to have you.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.840]   He is an editor at large.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.760]   It's seen that focusing though a lot on cars.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.360]   We'll have a little to talk about today.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.240]   Are you saying that I have a lot of children
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.600]   or that I have to go to jail?
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.120]   You don't have children, do you?
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.360]   I have no children at all.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.760]   You may be a little bit nervous there for now.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.920]   Don't you talk about the beard though?
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.200]   The beard says no kids, I feel.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.280]   That's really how they go.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.720]   Lead indicator of no kids.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.400]   Beers were dad things.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.200]   No.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.280]   Just says no shaving.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.680]   That's what it really says.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.360]   And Georgia Dow from Montreal and iMore.com.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000]   Great to have you, Georgia.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.560]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.880]   Last time I saw you, it was a WWDC, the Apple.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.200]   Yes, it was.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.080]   Music announcement and all of that.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.200]   Was it WWDC?
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.480]   Really?
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.320]   Gosh, it seems like--
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.640]   We were you.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.720]   How has Apple music been to you?
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.880]   Because it's only been out now for a month.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.120]   You like it?
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.880]   I'm enjoying it.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.360]   I find that it's a lot of fun.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.600]   I find a lot of different tracks that I wouldn't find
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.160]   naturally, it feeds my lazy natural nature.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.360]   I can just listen to music as I need to.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.280]   You just push play.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.880]   Yeah, or I just ask Siri to play something for me.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.960]   And it finds any song that--
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640]   almost any song that's in existence
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.600]   that I would want to listen to.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.440]   So that's great.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.800]   Apple folks seem to say Siri is the kind of magic sauce
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.280]   for Apple music.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.400]   Because that's one thing that nothing else can do, right?
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.760]   If only it worked though.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.040]   I mean, Siri, I feel like we've all had iPhones now
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.560]   for some time.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.240]   Siri's been on them for a long time.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.840]   And the experience hasn't gotten that much better
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.760]   if you're on an incremental basis over the last,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.960]   but two, three years now.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.200]   And so when people say it's a selling point, I'm like, eh,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.200]   pass.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.360]   It's like function.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.960]   But you wouldn't-- I mean, what do you say to Siri, Georgia?
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.480]   I'll just say play smooth criminal from Glee or something
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.640]   else that I find out.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.120]   Oh my god, it's so raw.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.240]   From Glee?
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.040]   Can we cut off her skype stream?
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.920]   This is not going to work out.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.440]   Don't you think I actually--
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.360]   We're going to wrap that.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.320]   I was with you until you said Glee.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.840]   I didn't know the one with me.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.640]   It was Renee.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.240]   It was Renee who showed me all this.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.000]   You're a smooth criminal.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.960]   It was Renee.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.120]   I'm sneaking in your house, Lated.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.000]   No, that's really good.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.520]   Who's done?
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.920]   Or it was Billie Jean or something.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   Billie Jean.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.000]   But he showed it from all the different song
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.760]   that it could just find just by asking.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.920]   So even if you're listening to it from one of your favorite
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.480]   shows, it'll be able to figure it out, which is really neat.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.840]   Surely it has Michael Jackson doing smooth criminal.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.080]   Yes, if you ask for it.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.580]   It will.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.120]   That's one problem.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.200]   A lot of music services.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.240]   If you say, I want to hear the Beatles nowhere, man,
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.400]   it'll go nowhere, man.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.900]   Right.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.160]   Georgia, does it have tool?
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.440]   Right.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.000]   Is tool on the service?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.480]   Tool.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.880]   Tool.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.480]   It don't.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.040]   It's tool.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.120]   What is tool?
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.200]   What's tool?
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.960]   Is that-- that's what they make wedding gowns out of?
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.920]   It's pink, like--
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.320]   No, that's just pure stuff.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.880]   Tool is a all metal band that does a lot of prog rock.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.640]   And they're not on Spotify, which is my main beef
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.440]   is Spotify today, because there's no--
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.040]   Georgia, can you ask Siri?
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.160]   Yeah, you do it on live for us.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.720]   If you could--
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.280]   I will.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.320]   It's probably navigating you to a--
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.640]   Siri, can I play tool?
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.880]   Here's what I found on the web for Siri.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.680]   Can I play tool?
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.040]   And that's why Siri is all crap.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.240]   Like, the fan in on the web.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.760]   But what song is it?
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.160]   Because there's so many ways that you--
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.040]   it's going to understand what tool means.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.680]   So do you know one of their songs or the band's--
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.200]   Look, if Siri can't figure out what tool
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.880]   is in the musical context, then I quit.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.120]   And they're one of the biggest bands
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.480]   in the world.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.360]   But no, it's not a musical context.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.680]   Siri is in every context.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.200]   That's not--
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.240]   Well, then it's bad.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.840]   Like, if you can't do what she wants,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.240]   play implies music.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.440]   Tool is one of the biggest bands in the world.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.960]   Say this.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.000]   If you were to be able to do that.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.880]   Can you play a--
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.960]   say Siri play tool, prison, sex, and sober?
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.840]   There we go.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.040]   Siri, can you play tool, prison, sex, and sober?
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.240]   I just wanted to hear her say that.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.680]   Dangerous.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.160]   If you don't know, those are the tracks off
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.720]   tools first album.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.200]   No, could not find it.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.240]   There is no tool.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.640]   It's not unusual that Spotify--
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.080]   if Siri-- if Spotify doesn't have it that Apple music
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.440]   wouldn't have it.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.720]   No, I agree with that entirely.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.080]   Because it's probably tools.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.440]   A tool saying you can't have it.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.840]   Certainly.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.200]   But I think people say Apple music is better in some way.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.960]   It has more.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   What am I?
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.760]   It's apparently a dozen.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.320]   Because the one thing I can't find, the one thing
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.440]   I have on Spotify is that.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.640]   And then I'll have the why.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.920]   I'm going to move my Playlist over
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.040]   and give them different money.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.720]   Just know.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.220]   Right.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.840]   And there is voice search on Spotify as well.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.040]   You can do the same sorts of things there,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.840]   especially using something like Android Auto.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.160]   You can do--
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   play me something by so and so and it'll play.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.320]   Actually, and I said in the past that you couldn't upload
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.160]   your music collection to Spotify.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.280]   But somebody's corrected me on that as well.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.760]   Right?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.120]   You can.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   I asked if you don't know.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.080]   I've never tried that to be honest.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.560]   Yeah, I didn't.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.240]   I was as code-funded as I wanted to play.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.880]   I thought you couldn't.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.480]   No, you can.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.120]   You can, though.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.600]   You can.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.400]   So that was one real differentiator.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.760]   I thought the Google All Access and iTunes music
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.000]   will include your existing record collection,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.600]   along with their 30 million songs.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.560]   So if you had tool ripped, you'd have it in there.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.240]   But I feel like we were sold to premise of stream music
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.200]   is the future no longer keep that stack of CDs.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.120]   Don't worry about your files.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.960]   Just have the application and you'll get together.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.240]   So given this a 99.5% solution, I'm not
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.200]   going to go to the record store and buy a bunch of tool
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.480]   albums, rip them, put them online.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.080]   Because it's the one band I don't have.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.720]   I feel like they should just solve that problem
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.400]   and get to an end name.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.520]   But again, I think you have to blame tool for that.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.200]   I will tool a bunch of tools.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.840]   There you go.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.680]   Tool tool that.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.600]   There you go.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.280]   Please don't ban me.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.520]   Jim Dowrymple of--
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.480]   Yeah, now you're never going to get it.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.760]   Jim Dowrymple of loop insight wrote a screed screaming
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.400]   at Apple music.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.560]   Now Jim is an Apple guy.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.440]   I mean, he loves--
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.640]   Matt Katashi loves Apple.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.960]   But he said that's it.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.600]   I'm not using Apple music anymore.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.000]   It lost 2,400 of my songs.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.360]   Mostly oddly enough, Aussie Osbourne and Black Sabbath.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.560]   I thought it was 4,700 songs.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.400]   Well, it was a lot.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.600]   But anyway, the update on the loop is that Apple--
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.080]   but see, you're going to get special help
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.960]   if you're Jim Dowrymple.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.640]   Apple worked with him and they got all but a few hundred back.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.040]   In any event, doesn't sound like a good experience.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.400]   Jim will join us on Tuesday.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.720]   I'll just see that he's definitely an Apple lover.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.880]   But obviously, he's more of a music lover than an Apple
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.360]   lover.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   He's also a beer lover.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.520]   So I wonder if there were ever an Apple beer service
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.960]   that lost some of his beers or that would rank in there.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.480]   But certainly, music seems to rank higher than Apple
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.000]   in his priorities.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.280]   And rightly so.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.920]   Happy 30th anniversary to this.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.600]   You know what that is, kids?
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.960]   This is what mom and dad used to play with late at night
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.840]   after you were asleep.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.680]   It's an Amiga 30 years ago on Friday, the Amiga came out.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.280]   Let me play the promo video from 1987.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.400]   You are about to step into a brave new world of power,
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.360]   performance, and productivity made possible by the new Commodore
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.280]   and the 500 home computer.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.760]   Look at that.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.320]   That's made on.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   That's not done.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.760]   You're the best paid on the program.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.320]   Wow.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.200]   Stand back.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.040]   I am the Commodore Amiga 500.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.280]   I am the ultimate home computer.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.920]   So please, with powers and abilities far beyond anything
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.200]   you may have ever experienced before,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.600]   I'm dazzling graphics and animation,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.160]   a home office productivity wonder.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.560]   I am extraordinary home video production
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.760]   and special effects, a versatile composer of thought.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.480]   As well as music, I am arcade quality games in stereo,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   a teacher effect, and a ton of details.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.480]   I am 512,000 by 2,000.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.720]   Wait, there's a smoke machine.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.960]   Oh, I've got to go to one megabyte of internal memory.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.440]   Oh, man, Superman.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.080]   I think that's right.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.160]   Off processor, a built-in 3 and 1/2 inch disk drive,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.640]   and a floating keyboard with a 10-inch drive.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.240]   How dare you?
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.800]   There are better stocks.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.920]   First of all, easy to use menus and pull down windows
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.600]   make me adaptable to virtually every goal
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.440]   and aspect of your life.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.360]   At the touch of a button, at the click of the mouse,
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.600]   I am yours to command and control.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.520]   At a price you can afford.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.760]   This is a long-adding you have.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.720]   We've all possible.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.520]   You know what?
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.920]   It's nine minutes and 32 seconds.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.520]   I don't think we're going to watch the whole thing.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   Can we just-- can we come on and talk about it?
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.560]   Because I feel like we're going to be
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   your long enough to all die in our chance.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.360]   But I am the Commodore of Miga.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.160]   Well, actually, I'm supposed to be doing that voice
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.320]   over my first job.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.080]   I actually--
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.400]   Really?
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   There was a--
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.680]   I've got four-cave quality graphics.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.440]   An event at the Computer History Museum on Friday,
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.640]   celebrating the 30th anniversary of the--
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.200]   Miga, we're laughing at it, but we've come a long way
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:56.800]   in 30 years.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.200]   But this was really a breakthrough
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.000]   when it came out.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.040]   The graphics, particularly.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.920]   I love how the ad structure is this kind of like sci-fi,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.360]   smoke machine, 80s rock band kind of event.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.120]   Now it's all like Apple ads that are like,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.400]   Apple, it helps you find your car.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.200]   They're so cool.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.000]   They're so hip.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.560]   And this is not-- this is the opposite of cool.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.760]   This is hot.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.160]   Wow.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.480]   OK.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.120]   Well, that joke slide.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.560]   Oh, look.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.000]   You can-- you can be to lose the track.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.960]   That's great.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.240]   And look at that mouse.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.160]   Wow.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.000]   Two buttons.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.320]   Mom, he mustn't be a father.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.400]   He's got a beard.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.280]   That's my entire point.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.160]   That guy has like four kids he won't claim.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.800]   So Steve Jobs.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.760]   But he is dating.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.280]   Who is that?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.040]   Kristi Brinkley?
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.200]   Who is-- oh, the girl with a pearl earring?
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.720]   Wow.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.960]   It's a heart.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.760]   Anyway, our happy anniversary, Amiga.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.840]   We'll stop that now.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.200]   Wow.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.680]   That's on YouTube if you want to watch the entire thing.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.200]   Nine minutes.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.960]   It'll be in the show notes if you want to.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.400]   It's in the show notes.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.760]   Apple Music said Jim Dallerper is a nightmare,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.200]   and I'm done with it.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.120]   Wow.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.160]   Dave Mark, who's also on Loop Insight.com,
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:04.120]   responded, why I'm not done with Apple Music, Jim Dallerimple.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.160]   He basically said all the same things,
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.520]   but yet he's a little more optimistic for the future.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.280]   It wasn't much of a rebuttal in my opinion.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.520]   It was more of a-- yeah, I have the same issues,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.680]   but I'm a little bit more optimistic.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.240]   I think what do you think, Tim?
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.120]   This seemed like the issues that Jim really had
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.400]   came down to the fact that Apple didn't distinguish
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.840]   between songs that were on different albums,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.680]   same song, different album, like a compilation album,
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.120]   a best-of, and the original.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.520]   And seems to me that's a minor.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.680]   That's something most people wouldn't care about.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.720]   It definitely seemed like catalog issues for the most part,
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.480]   and that's a huge issue back in the long time ago.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.240]   I actually helped with the other startup that
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.640]   was trying to do some streaming music stuff,
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.440]   and that was a huge issue.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.400]   Just trying to get people to kind of trawl
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.520]   through these massive catalogs of music
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.480]   to make sure that everything is all linked up as it should be.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.040]   That makes me wonder if indeed Apple Music didn't
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.280]   kind of come together in the last minute,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.760]   like there was a lot of ruins that maybe it did.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.800]   But that's definitely a bad sign of data integrity issues
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.520]   and that kind of thing within if you're losing music.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.160]   And like you mentioned, Jim is obviously
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.360]   getting some special treatment here.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.920]   I wonder if anybody who on the street
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   had lost 400, 700 tracks, if they had the same issue.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.560]   But to be-- yeah, I mean, these are the sorts of issues
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.120]   that will certainly go away.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.360]   But when you're coming out of the gate and taking on Spotify
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.560]   that's been in the market for years now,
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.160]   it is in a pretty good state.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.360]   These things have got to be perfect,
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.640]   and pretty clear that this is not perfect yet.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.560]   I actually had to-- Georgia Reliance,
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.840]   a serenity call, will to explain to me
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.200]   some of the insides, ins and outs of Apple Music.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.000]   She's written a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.440]   And on the Beats War radio, it's not completely intuitive.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.240]   No, no.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.640]   I think that that's-- it's just a really big problem
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.440]   in trying to figure out what does everything mean
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.000]   and what do you actually have and what shouldn't you
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.120]   delete versus what you can keep so that you always
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.080]   have a hard file and you're not going to have to worry
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.640]   about losing a whole bunch of songs
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.360]   that you're really attached to.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.560]   So I do the same thing.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.600]   I just ask serenity.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.200]   Serenity, what do you have to do with hand-tied?
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.000]   What do I have to do so I don't have to lose anything
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.600]   that's important?
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.320]   Some of these problems go back to the fact
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.560]   that we're in between the physical media era
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.920]   and the streaming media era.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.640]   And well, you're obviously a child, Alex.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.600]   Indeed.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.680]   I'm a teeny, actually.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.840]   Practically, a teenager.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.280]   Unfortunately.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.720]   Are you still-- are you still have any attachment
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.680]   to physical media, or can we just let that go?
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.760]   Well, I mean, in terms of news, I absolutely do.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.560]   I love reading the paper.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.240]   You like a paper?
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.760]   Absolutely.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.040]   Wow.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.480]   Because I read more broadly.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.320]   It demands that I--
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.680]   I agree.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.240]   --I branch out.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.000]   You can skim their serenity.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.600]   You surprise yourself with stories you would see.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.720]   Also, I'm usually bored and drunk on an airplane.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.160]   So it kind of works out.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.320]   But for music, I've really left behind the entirety
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.120]   of owning music.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.600]   And I just rented and paid for it now.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.320]   I mean, back in the Zoom days-- people forget
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.280]   that Zoom software was actually fantastic back
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.840]   when it was live.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.960]   I used to love to own songs, upload them, buy them,
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.920]   store them, track them, back them up, and so forth.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.760]   Now, Spotify, I see no actual reason to do that.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.640]   So I'm like, buy in tool albums.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.440]   I just-- I don't even think that direction anymore.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.560]   I'm just like, oh, why--
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.120]   I pay much money.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.360]   So that's why it's upsetting, because they don't have it.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:56.720]   Right.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.880]   And I would pay-- they're like, Alex, Spotify plus tool
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.040]   is 20 bucks a month.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.800]   I'd be like, done.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.640]   Swipe.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.720]   What about sound quality?
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.520]   Because Apple has not addressed its title.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.800]   And Deezer both started offering CD quality sound.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.480]   Apple hasn't even mentioned anything like--
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.000]   We know those headphones that sell through iPhone
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.440]   that have the 10-cell audio of like 10 things being
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.600]   watched as a state of class.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.840]   I don't think they care.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.360]   And Beats headphones are notoriously bad for sound quality.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.040]   So I don't think it's played a priority for them.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.880]   But I mean, I think Spotify, if they can increase
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   their content library, is the main play for the future,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.480]   at least for me.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.120]   Ironically, you mentioned Zoom.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.160]   I was looking at the catalogs of all the major streaming
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.240]   music players.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.800]   Xbox Music has the largest catalog of all of them.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.320]   Now, call them.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.720]   Now, call Groove, I believe.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.560]   They renamed it?
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.080]   They renamed it.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.240]   It was--
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.080]   Was Zoom Music-- then it was Xbox Music.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.800]   Now, it's Groove.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.120]   Next one would be Trash Band, Failed, and Before.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.520]   Microsoft is desperate to try to win here,
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.120]   but I don't know what their larger--
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.840]   Groove, really?
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.560]   Yeah, it's called Groove Music Now.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.760]   Groove Music Now.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.480]   Well, they bought the Groove--
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.680]   Oh, they bought some of the software from Old Guide.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:15:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.000]   Microsoft Recycles and Rebrands.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   There you go.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.160]   The old name meant the app was ignored by people who
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:05.920]   didn't have an Xbox.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.760]   That's a good point.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.800]   It's a very, very good point.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.080]   Because it isn't just Xbox.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.160]   That brand does not persist outside the console realm,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.920]   I don't think.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.400]   Did you read the article, the post,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.600]   from the creator of SeekPod?
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:25.560]   Apple, he says, got basically targeted me
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.600]   and got the music labels to shut him down.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.480]   You may remember back in 2007, SeekPod
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.400]   was a search engine for music.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.800]   And I guess, of course, part of the issue
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.280]   is that much of that music was illegal,
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.600]   although that wasn't a necessity.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.160]   It's the Groove Shark problem.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.240]   It's the Groove Shark problem.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.360]   In fact, Apple went after Groove Shark as well.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.640]   But he says, I have the smoking gun.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.200]   I was told by Warner Music that Steve Jobs had a meeting
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:04.040]   with them and said that streaming users services like SeekPod
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.320]   are going to be a problem if we're
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.520]   going to make a deal with you.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.200]   So this is a problem company that
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.040]   needs to be addressed by Warner.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.480]   Warner--
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.440]   It'd be a shame if something happened to music service.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:15.880]   It would be a shame.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.440]   It'd be a shame to burn the ground.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   It'd be a shame to burn the ground.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.120]   It'd be a shame to burn the ground.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.400]   Yeah, people forget that Apple doesn't make a lot of money
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.720]   by accident.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.240]   And they don't win categories like iTunes for 10 years
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.280]   by play nice.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:26.920]   They play hard.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.840]   They make great products.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.760]   I mean, I've been Apple guy mostly.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.720]   But they don't win by mistake.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.240]   And so in this case, this beautiful story actually
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.800]   lays out the history of how SeekPod essentially
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.000]   wrecked by legal fees and so forth,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.240]   how they couldn't survive.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.440]   They were sued for what was it?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.880]   $40 billion at some point in time?
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.400]   It was an ludicrous quantity.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.880]   They wanted damages for every song, every search.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   $120k per search, which means no mathematical--
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.560]   I know, I know.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.040]   It's crazy.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.440]   It's almost like lawyers are not nice.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.760]   But they eventually failed.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.520]   And so we saw innovation in a way
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.280]   be snuffed out by incumbent interests,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.720]   which is really too bad.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.760]   Although iTunes was revolutionary at its time,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.400]   it certainly shows how they protect that franchise
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   with the heavy weight of $40 billion lawsuits.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.240]   I mean, I've had conversations.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.680]   Of course, we've had Rob Reed on who was at Rhapsody.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.960]   I've had conversations with many companies who have found
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.840]   themselves in the music industry's sites.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.920]   And it's not pretty.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.400]   But what Kasey and Frank says in his article here on Medium
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.360]   is that he realized he wasn't fighting the record labels.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.040]   He was fighting Apple computers that
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.160]   was using the record labels as a proxy to attack him.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.760]   And I think that's when he says, I realized it was over.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.800]   Well, it's a branding point.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.640]   If this is Apple's two small startup
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.200]   to infringe on the media, they can't do that.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   But if Warren's music doesn't, everyone already hates them.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.960]   Apple has to protect its kind of consumer-based brand.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.240]   They can't do any worse.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.200]   But I mean, they have the labels by the needs.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.080]   So they have to kind of do what they want, I think,
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.640]   or they can be negotiated and so forth.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.560]   So Apple really has almost a standing army of not its own lawyers,
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.920]   but also your lawyers and his lawyers and her lawyers
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.320]   to do their work, which is impressive.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.760]   But they have $200 billion in cash, so.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   Whatever.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.560]   Is Apple music still under investigation for their practices?
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.600]   I remember that they were before I left on the trip on vacation.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.280]   It's what happens.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.000]   Three weeks you're gone.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.920]   It's like Rip Van Winkle.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   I have no idea what happened.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.600]   But there was a story that they were being investigated.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.200]   If Al Franken, for instance, wrote a letter.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.080]   Well, he asked for it.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   Did he actually get the investigation?
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.920]   George, do we know what's going on with this?
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.960]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.040]   I don't believe that they are.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.320]   I don't think that it's going forward, but I'm not sure about that.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.360]   OK.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.200]   FTC is investigating Apple's practices, the 30% cut
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.640]   that Apple takes out of streaming music subscriptions, which
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.760]   forces competitors like Spotify and Pandora
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.120]   to either charge higher rates or lose
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.320]   in amount and revenue equivalent.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.440]   In other words, the record labels say, hey, we're getting 70%
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.520]   from Apple.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.600]   What about you, Spotify?
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.360]   So Franken is actually piling on.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.520]   He's written a letter to both the FTC
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.600]   and the Department of Justice saying Apple is anti-competitive.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.920]   So there is an investigation on it.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.480]   He does this every single week, though.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.920]   Franken is infamously the amount of press releases
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.160]   he puts out of demanding things.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.920]   It's probably this PR strategy.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.480]   So I've never quite heard of it seriously,
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.920]   or just kind of disregarded entirely.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.040]   You have to wonder when you get a letter from a senator.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.880]   How does that like?
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.600]   Oh, yeah, thanks Al.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.080]   Or do they take that more seriously?
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.080]   Come over for lunch on Tuesday.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   We'll talk about it.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.880]   We're going to take a break.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.360]   You guys had at I'more.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.120]   You guys had a roundtable discussing the Apple Watch
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.760]   three months in.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.480]   I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.560]   Georgia Dow is here from I'more.com.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.200]   Also with us, Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch, Tim Stevens,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.800]   from CNET, the week's tech news on the table.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.480]   Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.400]   If you're in business and you are the person responsible
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.200]   for hiring, you know that kind of can be an onus, a challenge.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.120]   One of the nice things about the internet, though,
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.360]   is it makes it a little bit easier.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.520]   Thanks to all these job boards.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.840]   But which board is the right board for you to approach?
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.360]   Whereas your next employee coming from with ZipRecruiter,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.440]   you don't have to worry about that.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.600]   You'll post to 100 plus job boards with a single click
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.840]   of the mouse, including social networks like Twitter and Facebook.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.160]   I like that.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.560]   And if you're saying, well, I'm not sure that's such a great thing.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.200]   I don't want to have a million candidates, a lot of emails
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.360]   and phone calls, don't worry, because all of your candidates
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.840]   go right into the ZipRecruiter interface
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.640]   where it's easy to screen, write, and hire
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.080]   the right candidate fast.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.920]   You'll also get access to 4 million current resumes,
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.320]   people who have sent their resumes to ZipRecruiter.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.160]   That means you're going to find somebody fast
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.360]   and the right person fast.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.560]   And isn't that, after all, the most important thing.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.640]   Hiring is tough.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.640]   You want to do it right.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.200]   Hire the best people.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.080]   Turns out summertime is a pretty good time.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.800]   You would think a bad time, but no, because your competitors
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.280]   are on vacation.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.560]   And so those quality candidates who are applying for work
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.200]   right now, there's not so much competition for them.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.680]   This is a great time to take advantage of ZipRecruiter.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.840]   We got an email from Rick.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.480]   He's a happy ZipRecruiter client, said, quote,
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.440]   "I had a great experience using ZipRecruiter
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.600]   was so fast and easy to input all my information
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.720]   and have it sent out on the web," I had replies,
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.200]   from highly qualified individuals-- and this is the key--
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.520]   within 24 hours.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.280]   I highly recommend this service to anyone
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.120]   wanting to expand their business.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.520]   Over 400,000 businesses, including
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.560]   Twitter, have used ZipRecruiter.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.040]   You can try it for free, four days free.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   Right now, ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.880]   ZipRecruiter.com/twit, post a 100 plus job boards
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.080]   with a single click of the mouse.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.760]   Alex, you're not wearing the Apple Watch.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.680]   How can you be part of the group if you're not
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.600]   wearing the Apple Watch?
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.840]   Oh, I'm the cool one, actually.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.840]   OK.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.240]   Tim, are you wearing an Apple Watch?
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.400]   Wearing no watch at the moment.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.200]   I'm wearing no watch at the moment.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.200]   I'm wearing no watch at the moment.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.840]   Oh, you like the time?
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.360]   It's OK.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.800]   I've been wearing the Android--
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.400]   I went back to Android, or I want the Apple Watch on vacation,
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.280]   but I'm wearing the LG Urbain.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.880]   But Georgia, I know you're wearing an Apple Watch.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.240]   I am wearing my Apple Watch.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.400]   There you go.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:22.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.680]   That's styling.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.120]   What are you doing there with that?
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.040]   It's like that.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.560]   Like that.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.720]   That's a sparovski bracelet.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.680]   It gives it a little bit of bling.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.160]   And so--
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.880]   Well, a lot of bling.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.160]   Yeah, but watch is a little bit--
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.280]   for femininity, it's lacking a little bit there.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:37.400]   So--
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.360]   That's pretty cool.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.280]   Now, you're an athlete.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.000]   So is it because of--
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.440]   and so is serenity, of course.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.160]   I don't know so much.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.760]   I guess Renee's an athlete, too.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.760]   You guys are all in great shape.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.240]   So that's some of the advantage.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.040]   Peter Cohen's definitely not an athlete.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.440]   He actually trains a lot.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.560]   And he also has been watching his weight.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.240]   And using it a lot for keeping his fitness tracking--
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.520]   and I think that out of all of us,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.400]   he utilizes all of the fitness sets.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.040]   Interesting.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.160]   He really enjoys that it reminds him
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.760]   when he needs to take something, when he needs to do something.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.960]   And keeps him on track.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.760]   I find for me, because I do contact sports,
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.160]   where I'm versus another person, I cannot actually
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.240]   wear my watch during a period of time,
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.480]   because I could injure them with it, which is not allowed.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.720]   I could injure them with my body.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.280]   That's allowed.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.240]   But I can injure them with my watch.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.680]   So how much per day do you wear the Apple watch?
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   On an average day for you, it's like eight hours,
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.560]   ten hours, twelve hours.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.920]   What's the usual mix, if you will?
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.520]   If I am at work, I use it constantly.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.520]   So if I'm out of the house, I use it almost all the time.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.760]   If I'm at home, I usually don't have it on.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.880]   So at home, I don't want to be bothered or notified
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.920]   or deal with anything I want to shut off.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.040]   So I don't have my phone on.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.640]   It doesn't ring.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.440]   I turn my phone off.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.400]   And I usually leave my watch to charge.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.640]   So rarely do I actually use it in my home.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.520]   Charging is one of the issues.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.760]   I'm not having any problems with it.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.280]   I easily get through the day with a lot of juice left.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.240]   But Lisa, who exercises-- people
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.520]   who seem to exercise with the watch on,
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.400]   especially the 38 millimeter, claim
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.080]   that they're having trouble keeping a full day's charge.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.640]   Have you seen that?
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:13.920]   Right.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.560]   Well, it's going to be using the heart rate monitors.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.120]   It's more active when you're training.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.320]   Plus, it's smaller.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.600]   So the 38 is smaller.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.360]   So because of that, the battery life
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.120]   is not going to last really as long.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.800]   But I usually have it that it has an extra 30% to 40%
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.160]   by the end of the day.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:32.680]   It's funny.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   So I don't really--
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.440]   Peter Cohen says he likes the activity monitor.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.680]   He likes being forced to stand up.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.640]   You and Rich and a number of them say, that's the worst part.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.760]   I don't want to be nagged.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.960]   First thing I turned off.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.760]   First thing, it just mocked me.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.400]   I was like, no, it's not happening.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.320]   So I turned that off right away.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.480]   The stand up thing seems like an afterthought
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.080]   that wasn't really well thought out.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   Because it always happens at 10 to the hour.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:57.560]   Right.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:57.920]   Right?
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.720]   And I just told Lisa, just go like this.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   You know, rave your arm around.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.640]   And then you get a little ding after a minute,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.960]   and you're happy.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.080]   You don't need to stand up.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.280]   You don't have to.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.680]   It also doesn't seem to be paying attention
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.800]   if I'm working out.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   It still says stand up.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.280]   Right.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:13.440]   Right.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.840]   It doesn't count towards your standing up
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.480]   if you're working out.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.000]   OK.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.320]   You have to stand up again.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.640]   It's an elaborate troll against tech bloggers,
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.760]   because we're always sitting down.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.920]   And so I feel like it was designed just to annoy us.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.000]   Actually, I don't think you're far off, Alex.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I think it's probably Apple's subtly saying,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.880]   we know you're all a sedentary bunch.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.200]   So the best thing we could do in a watch
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.640]   is to get you stand up for one minute and hour.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.880]   I was not born for exercise, sir.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.200]   That was not why God made me.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.080]   But that's why you need to have the Apple Watch help
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.000]   mock you into actually getting up every once in a while,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.080]   or at least reminding you so you'd have the choice to do it.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.440]   I think that the one thing that I really would like
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.360]   to have change is I would like to have the option
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.720]   to have the low power and always--
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.480]   the watch fails as a watch for me.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.720]   That's a problem with my app watch.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.280]   Is that if I'm in session or if I'm in a meeting with someone,
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.720]   I cannot--
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.400]   it's really hard to flick my wrist or tap my screen
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.240]   without someone noticing that I'm checking with my--
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.120]   That was distracting.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.480]   So it does not do a good job.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.880]   So I actually have-- even if I'm wearing my watch,
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.760]   I have to have my little tiny watch on the desk
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.040]   during my sessions so that I can also keep track of the time.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.240]   So I would love if it could just have like,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.520]   I'll be good with the watch.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.960]   I don't care if I have to recharge halfway through the day,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.560]   but let it be a watch and always have the time on for me.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.360]   So, Georgia, is it as bad as phone etiquette?
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.720]   Because I feel like now, whenever I'm at a dinner
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.040]   with friends or my partner or whatever,
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.440]   we need to put our phones down a little stack,
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.680]   just keep them out of the way.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.320]   Does the watch keep you more--
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.480]   Yeah, one of those people.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.520]   No, no, we do it politely, just when we're hanging out.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.720]   No, I've seen people do that.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.480]   There's a little stack of phones on the table.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.080]   The whole point is we're trying to not tweet
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.160]   texts and so forth during dinner.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.360]   We're trying to be with the group.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.680]   You know, trying to be personal.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.680]   So does the phone allow you to be kind of like still plugged in,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.640]   even when you're trying to be more, I don't know,
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.600]   available in a social setting?
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.440]   I think that it's a great sheet.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.000]   Yeah, cheating.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.920]   You can very casually lift up your wrist and take a peek
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.040]   and no one's going to notice.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.160]   And so I think that it's a great way
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.120]   that you can stay connected.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.800]   It's not something that's going to be interfering.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.640]   The problem with the phone is that they're huge.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.200]   So my iPhone 6 Plus takes--
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.320]   you can't see me at all if I'm going to take a look at it.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.880]   There's no discrete way to get that out of my pocket
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.480]   or out of my--
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.880]   Wait, either you're very small or that phone is actually
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.880]   abnormally large.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's both, actually.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.920]   The phone is huge.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.080]   That's bigger than your head.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.360]   Can you put it closer to your face?
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.880]   Are you going to put a perspective on me?
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   There we go.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.400]   Oh, all right.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:38.920]   OK.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.920]   It's still massive.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.760]   How's your fabulous?
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.200]   It's still a perspective.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.040]   Is that funny?
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.400]   I mean, I guess you're a small person
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.360]   because the phone really looks big in your hands.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.920]   I'm hobbit-like, truly.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   OK.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.880]   Wow, is Apple making a 9-inch tablet?
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.840]   That's--
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.920]   if you break off the screen of your laptop, actually,
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.720]   it works as a tablet.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.920]   If you hold it back, it's actually like my mini.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.080]   It's hard to hold your ear after.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:05.880]   I think the real--
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.080]   and we've mentioned this before,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.440]   but I think the real thing is we're waiting for Watch 2.0.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.840]   Watch OS 2.0.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.880]   That's when the phone really-- or the Watch rather, really--
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.880]   either sinks or swims.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.760]   May not be enough.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.920]   I'm like 98% sure I'll buy an Apple Watch 3.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.320]   So--
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.560]   You'll buy an Apple Watch 3?
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.680]   Yeah, probably.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.920]   Not 2.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.000]   The one was a little rougher than I expected when it came out.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.360]   I think the second one would be impressive,
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.840]   and the third one would be the 3GS.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.440]   So I'll take that.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.960]   Yeah, you might be right.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.880]   Ashley Madison got hacked, scaring a lot of people,
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.160]   37 million users of the hookup service.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.360]   The slogan of Ashley Madison is,
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.880]   "Life is short, have an affair."
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:51.860]   Right.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.520]   Like you don't have enough stress in your life already.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.800]   Must have scared some people when they got news
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.440]   that the site had been hacked.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.920]   It's a very uncomfortable conversation
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.320]   to explain to your wife what Ashley Madison is
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.360]   in the first place.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.160]   To prove that you even know that the site exists
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.520]   is a little bit daunting, but like no,
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.600]   it's I'm a tech expert.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.640]   I have to know about these sort of hack stories, really.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.760]   Well, and also there are other sites, Cougar.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.880]   I was always going to happen.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.040]   Cougar life.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.600]   And?
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.720]   Established men.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.440]   What is established men?
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.160]   Well, not me.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.160]   I don't know why I'm looking at you.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.800]   I'm 14.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.400]   You got over this.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.640]   No, but actually, I went on CNN to talk about this.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:33.920]   Did you?
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   And yeah, yeah.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.880]   And it was one of those things they promised security.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.960]   Like if you join the site, you have to be anonymity.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.960]   Absolutely.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.800]   I would think so.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.120]   All services to screw up on security
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.760]   and who's part of their database.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.440]   Oh, my heavens, this is not the place you want to have.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.280]   Ashley Madison has a quote, full delete feature.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.720]   You could also call it the wife button.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.040]   That promises or the husband button.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.600]   Removal of site usage history and personally
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.640]   identifiable information from the site.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.040]   For a fee of $19.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.880]   But according to the team who hacked the site,
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.160]   they actually weren't doing that.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.680]   So all of that information is there.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.160]   Full delete, netted Ashley Madison, by the way, $1.7 million
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.440]   in revenue last year.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.120]   Not surprised?
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.120]   How much?
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.000]   $20 a shot?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.040]   I think it was $19 a shot.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.560]   And the problem was because they were not actually
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.480]   deleting the information.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.720]   The hackers were mad that it was offered as a for sale feature.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   And so they went after because they weren't actually
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.000]   deleting the information.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.440]   So they built, especially the biggest black male database
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.040]   they've ever built all the time.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Because they had the data still on the site.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.760]   Were the hackers targeting Ashley Madison because of that?
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.520]   That's what I read in two different places.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.040]   Wow.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.400]   I haven't talked to them personally.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.200]   I can't really confirm.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.040]   But I've seen that in a number of different reputable
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:46.480]   publications.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.760]   The hackers did write in their manifesto, I don't know,
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.840]   somewhere too bad for those men.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.880]   They're cheating dirt bags and deserve no such discretion.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.880]   Too bad for Ashley Madison.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.680]   You promised secrecy, but didn't deliver.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.440]   We've got the complete set of profiles in our database dump.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.240]   And we will release them soon if Ashley Madison stays online.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.880]   And with over 37 million members,
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.200]   mostly from the US and Canada, a significant percentage
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.240]   of the population is about to have a very bad day,
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.040]   including many rich and powerful people.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.000]   Wow.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.280]   They never did release that database.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.080]   Not to my knowledge.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.280]   No.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.120]   But I mean, some of the threat is still alive and afoot.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.680]   And I bet people are still sweating now.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.000]   I'd be terrified.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.480]   No.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.400]   You haven't, are you sure?
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:30.960]   Yes.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.640]   Positive.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.080]   Yes.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.600]   100%?
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.440]   100%
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.280]   Not even more drunk ones?
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:34.960]   Not even more.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.880]   You can go through that database.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.600]   If it doesn't look like a book, please double check it.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.680]   Make sure he's not lying to us.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.520]   Is Ashley-- yeah, really hackers.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.880]   Is Ashley Madison down?
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   No, they're still up.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.520]   Same picture of saying logo, same slogan.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.240]   And they're still getting people to register online
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.400]   and start new accounts, which is unusual.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.520]   Let's just say the least.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:56.880]   Maybe.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.000]   They're dedicated.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.120]   Maybe.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.120]   Wow.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.320]   It says on the site, thousands of cheating wives
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.800]   and cheating husbands.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.960]   It's got the trusted security award, by the way.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.400]   You have a logo on the site.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:11.920]   Wow.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.840]   They still have a logo that says,
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   "Trust is trusted--"
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.640]   --security award.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.960]   100% discrete service.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.240]   That's a major award.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.880]   That's big time.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.720]   It doesn't say--
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.000]   It's the Grammy of security.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.960]   There's no link to click like where you know where that--
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.280]   So I'm going to go-- I'm actually going to pay it,
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.520]   made a little like a badge logo and put it on the site.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   So pro tip, don't put your name on a site like this,
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.480]   because the internet is very unsecure right now.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.880]   And you will get busted, and I will laugh in your face.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.920]   Well, didn't adult friend finder also get hacked?
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.520]   That's a long--
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.120]   That was about a month ago, right?
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.640]   It sounds like hackers are actually going after these.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.760]   Is it to blackmail people, or is it just for the lulls?
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.000]   It's probably for the lulls.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.720]   Maybe both.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.800]   It'd be a lot of work.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.280]   I think some of it would be people--
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.840]   when people are slighted or angry,
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   they want to then have something to blame.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.720]   And so they can blame one of these sites
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.040]   and feel like they're almost justified.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.720]   These are bad people.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.400]   See what we did?
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.920]   Ha, ha, ha.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.720]   I still think it's mostly for the lulls.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.120]   I hope it is.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.720]   I think I'm not personally hope it is,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.480]   but I just hope it is for those--
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.400]   I mean, that's a lot of people.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.360]   You're going to get a lot of work, Georgia, as a marriage
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:18.800]   counselor.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.520]   I think you'll be very busy soon.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.040]   Actually, Montreal, everything goes, right?
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.080]   Montreal's really a very free open city.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.480]   It's very liberal, yeah.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.840]   You know, our work's actually liberal.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.480]   These are the kinds of New Orleans of Canada.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.160]   Right.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:32.520]   It is?
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.000]   It is?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.520]   It is.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.080]   I just made that up.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:34.560]   It is.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.160]   I like that.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:35.660]   It is.
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.840]   I did an exposure.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.480]   We painted our next red for someone
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.320]   that was worried about seeing no one even bats
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.120]   an eye in Montreal.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:43.880]   Nothing.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.800]   You could dress up in a shark suit.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.600]   No one would care.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.840]   Wow.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.080]   Yeah, I just feel like going onesie-toozy black mainly.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.320]   Unless you've got somebody really big, like a major politician.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.440]   But if you're a politician and you sign up for Ashley,
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.040]   Madison, with your real name, you deserve to go down.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   I want to know that.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.880]   You invited him.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.400]   That's a hug.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.640]   I mean, we all talk about Anthony Wiener still to this day,
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.760]   because of what he did, which was so, so stupid.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.440]   But I mean, like, that's not a uncommon trope or activity.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.440]   And so people are really just desperate for, you know,
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.280]   connection people in their lives.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.080]   And I think they turned the sort of thing in that way.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.160]   But if you're at all public, you just, you don't get to have that kind
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.560]   of flexibility or freedom.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.560]   Because you've sacrificed that to your career.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.680]   It also is that the lesson for all of us,
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.080]   which is that don't assume that anything you do on the internet
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.760]   can be kept private and secret.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.560]   I hope that's not true.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.800]   And you also, as a side, shouldn't be have the hubris to send out
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.120]   press releases, making fun of Apple during the iCloud hack.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:40.640]   They did?
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:40.840]   They did.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:40.960]   I think that great.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.680]   Your security is.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.480]   They did.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.120]   Robert Scoble actually posted a picture of it.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.000]   I actually found the same press release.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.440]   When all that was going on and all the iCloud stuff was going on,
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.600]   Ashley Madison put out a press release saying how great their security
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.440]   was and that you don't need to worry about them.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.760]   That is the kind of stuff that bubbles up and will stick in the eye
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.880]   when this kind of thing goes down.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.160]   No, talk about hubris.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:00.920]   Wow.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.480]   That's guaranteed.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.520]   That's just bad.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.840]   That's a quinoa hora.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.160]   That's not a good thing to do.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.440]   All right.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.600]   We're going to talk about the G-pack.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.840]   And I'm sure that Tim Stevens has a few things
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.160]   to say about that speaking of hackers.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.920]   Big recall too for Fiat Chrysler.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.400]   It's going to cost them a lot of money.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.480]   But before we do that, I want to talk about some
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.880]   of my favorite entertainment online documentaries.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.440]   Do you like documentaries?
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.680]   Who doesn't like documentaries?
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.200]   Everyone does.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.000]   It's like looking--
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.800]   OK, tell me if I'm nuts here.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.640]   Georgia, you're a therapist.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.600]   When I walk down the street at night and it's dark and people's
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.280]   houses are lit and the curtains aren't drawn,
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.520]   I look in the window, right?
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.040]   Everyone does.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.400]   Everybody does that, right?
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:44.840]   Right.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.360]   Not because we're lawyers.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:46.800]   Well, we are.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.840]   We're a little boy-ers.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.880]   But we're really interested in the lives of others, right?
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.080]   And documentaries to me are that.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.360]   But in a legitimate way of seeing how the other guy lives.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.400]   Doc Club is new from Sundance.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.800]   The Sundance Now Doc Club, a streaming service for those of us
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   who love documentaries.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.960]   Now, I have my picks on there, my five favorite documentaries.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.480]   But you can get the run of the place for 30 days
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.720]   when you go to docclub.com/twrit.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.880]   Real people, there's one on here
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.040]   that I had found.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.920]   And I don't know how I found it, but I loved it.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.760]   It's called Deepwater.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.040]   It's the story right after Chichester did his solo
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.840]   around the world sale, right?
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.880]   This became all the rage.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.000]   And I think it was the Guardian decided to have a competition
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.400]   of solos around the world sailors.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.640]   But one of the people who signed up for it
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.080]   was a complete amateur sailor.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.960]   And the story that comes out of it is amazing.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.720]   Show a movie is called Deepwater.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.200]   He ends up kind of pulling over and just waiting.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.040]   And then he skips-- it's incredible story.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.240]   Spoiler alert, Leo.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.400]   Yeah, sorry, spoiler alert.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.000]   Actually, I didn't tell you the big spoiler,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.640]   but you'll have to watch it for that.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.440]   It's a shark.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.800]   It's a shark.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.960]   Really, so I like sailing.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.240]   So this is a great story.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:20.000]   If you like crossword puzzles, wordplay, which not only
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.560]   is it a great story about the crossword puzzle competition,
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.160]   but it's also-- it features the puzzle designer, Will Shorts,
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.040]   from The New York Times.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.320]   And it's just fabulous.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.240]   It starts off with Will reading letters he gets every week
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.000]   from people who say, you are a bad man.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.160]   That clue was too hard.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.120]   It's really fun.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.040]   Dotclub.com/twit.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.320]   Documentary for everybody.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.120]   And I like it that they're asking.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.960]   They ask a lot of people for their picks,
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.280]   their recommendations.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.040]   People like Susan Sarandon and Ira Glass.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.840]   They have lots of fun stuff.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.880]   That's one of my picks, Hero Dreams of Sushi.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.640]   Oh, Hero Dreams of Sushi.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:38:59.640]   Oh.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.560]   That's amazing.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.760]   That is so good.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.440]   Even if you don't like sushi, you just
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.120]   have to watch because it's so impressive to see someone who
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.400]   is so precise and expertise at their skill.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.280]   And I think you would love Sushi at the end of it.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.360]   There's a slow motion sequence where they go through the whole meal
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.720]   in loving detail.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.160]   And man, my suggestion is you get some sushi during this movie
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.320]   because you're going to be hungry at the end.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.080]   It is awesome.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.800]   So for Twitter audience members, here's your chance.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   You can at least see this.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.200]   30 Days Free.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.080]   SundanceNow.club.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.600]   Go to Doc Club, d-o-c-c-l-u-b.club.com/twit
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.720]   for your 30-day free trial.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.760]   Is it available in Canada?
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.280]   I think so.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:40.640]   I don't know.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.640]   You should try Georgia and see.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.520]   I want to go on that boat thing.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.920]   300,000 big family here.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.720]   Just get on a boat and go around the world and see other--
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.600]   I like the idea.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.280]   You want to do that?
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.600]   How big is your boat?
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.320]   I don't have a boat.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.040]   You don't have boat?
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.720]   No, I like to see what I'm a boat.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   I'm thinking again a boat.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   It's a good twin boat.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.400]   How big do I need to get?
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.720]   150 with two decks in helicopter pad.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.520]   That'll do us.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.000]   Wet bar, one jacuzzi, one submarine, and then a rock
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:05.920]   throuces.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.280]   All right.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.640]   Also, that'll do that.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.480]   Well, let's see how the Ashley Madison lawsuit goes.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.000]   And I'll be in there.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.240]   You're settled in time, all right.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.160]   Let's talk Chrysler.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.600]   We talked about this on security now on Tuesday.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.760]   It's a fascinating story.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.720]   We had talked before about the insecurity of automobiles.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.000]   One of the things most auto designers have done
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.360]   is even though they have two computer systems,
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.640]   an entertainment system, and the system running things
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.600]   like the brakes and the ignition.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.840]   And one would think-- and they certainly say
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.040]   that these systems are separate.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.120]   It turns out, in fact, they're not.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.960]   That almost all of them are on the same bus.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.080]   They use CAN bus because it's cheap, not particularly secure.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.840]   And that means that if you can get
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.400]   into the entertainment system, you perhaps
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.640]   can get into the car's operational systems.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.560]   And that can be a real problem.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.440]   We've seen hacks before with people
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.560]   who have physical access to the car.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.160]   But Charlie Miller, who you remember from the Pwned-Own
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.400]   contest every year-- he's the guy who wins big bucks hacking
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.000]   the Mac every year--
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.800]   has demonstrated a remote hack.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:17.160]   He was able to hack a Jeep in this Wired article remotely
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.080]   from his living room.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.560]   Sitting on a couch, it turns out the Jeeps, like many cars,
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.720]   have 3G access, in this case from Sprint.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.120]   And they were able to figure out what the IP address was
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.760]   for every car, where the car was located,
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.960]   and then using undisclosed software.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:38.120]   Apparently, they're going to try to tell the world at DEF CON.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.280]   We'll see.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.840]   I have a feeling they'll be prohibited from doing that.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.080]   I'm very impressed by this.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.520]   Underscoring the dangers of the internet of things
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.800]   and the movement we have right now
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.420]   across all sorts of other expensive electronics, cars,
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.280]   toasters, whatever.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.920]   People don't realize there's a risk built
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.240]   into each one of those connections.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.160]   And so we have better, I think, larger end-end encryption.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.000]   This will keep adding, but Tim, you're the expert here.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.480]   So let's go.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.360]   Yeah, I mean, anything online is at risk.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.960]   There's still a lot of question marks about this story.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.400]   And they haven't exactly proven yet
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.800]   that they can do this without any physical access to the car.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.400]   That's the big story.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.200]   Because before this demonstration was run,
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.000]   they had plenty of time to do whatever they wanted to
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.600]   with this car within the car.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.320]   And that's what Fiat Chrysler said.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.680]   It said it would require physical access to the car.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.520]   Right.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.520]   If you can do this without physical access to the car,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.120]   that is incredibly-- that's horrifying.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.120]   That's really bad.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.280]   But if you have to get into the car and do something
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.840]   within the car to open up the door for this kind of an attack,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.440]   that's a little bit better.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.040]   And that's what Fiat is saying, that there
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   needs to be physical access.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.840]   But they're saying that they didn't need physical access
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.600]   at all.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.800]   That's what remains to be seen.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.560]   That's what I'm hoping that we find out when they do
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.120]   better demonstration of this.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.160]   But yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.800]   There's supposed to be some sort of a hard firewall
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.920]   between the infotainment system with the radio
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.160]   and the heater controls and all that stuff.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.600]   And the CAN bus network, which actually controls
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.760]   the power steering, the brakes and everything else.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.800]   And if you can bridge that gap, then at that point,
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.840]   you can steer the car, because most cars,
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.880]   these are quite a few cars anyhow, have electronic power
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.640]   steering, which means the computer can actually
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.000]   turn the wheel--
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Oh, I--
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.280]   --certainly boost for the brakes, which is built in.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.080]   A lot of cars have a throttle by wire,
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.200]   which means the computer is controlling the throttle too.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.960]   So the computer can steer the car,
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.080]   it can change lanes, it can certainly stop the car,
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.600]   or it can disable the brakes too if it wants to.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.800]   And that's definitely a very scary notion with the idea
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.600]   that a hacker could get into the car.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.800]   But again, the big question in my mind
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.040]   is can they do that without having to get into the car
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.760]   in the first place?
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.840]   And if someone can get into your car,
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.560]   they can do all sorts of bad things today.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.600]   Yeah, once somebody has physical access
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.320]   to any computing system, well, all bets are off, right?
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:41.840]   Exactly.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.840]   Tim, do you think they require physical access,
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.240]   or do you think that's more of a canard here?
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.520]   I think they probably do at this point,
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.680]   because I don't know how they would
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.760]   learn to identify that given car without having
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.400]   some kind of access to find it.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.680]   I'm guessing that all they probably need is a key
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.120]   out of the ECU or something like that.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.920]   So I'm kind of not identifying to basically figure out
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.880]   what this car is and probably a security key.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.760]   I bet that's all they need.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.280]   But I would be very surprised if they could do this,
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.920]   if they could basically be sitting on the side of the highway,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.200]   watch a G drive-by and click a button and take it over.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:09.680]   For new--
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.040]   Or even be in the next car car.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.600]   Sorry, the ECU is the computer that actually
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.400]   is controlling the works within the car.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.600]   And so within any kind of security system for cars,
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.000]   for example, any kind of a wireless key system
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.440]   has pretty simple but sophisticated enough series
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.320]   of keys that get passed back and forth, digital keys, that is.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.600]   So when you hit the unlock button on your car unlocks.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.080]   And that's pretty hard to actually hack.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.160]   But if you can get into the car, you
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.120]   can figure out the sequence of numbers that
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.880]   are generated to drive those keys.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.160]   At that point, you can unlock that car at will pretty much.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.240]   So I'm basically the idea, I would
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.320]   think, for the wireless connection.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.480]   I'm guessing there is some kind of encryption
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.360]   key that's involved that is stored within the ECU
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.000]   or somewhere within the car itself.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.640]   I'm guessing that they had to get into the car to find that key.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.480]   I could be wrong, but that's my guess.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.640]   So there's not that on this run.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.800]   It's a very large risk, but one that's smaller than it sounds
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.160]   on the front-fizzed camera.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.640]   Well, if somebody has physical access to your car,
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.040]   they could put sugar in your gas tank.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:11.880]   I mean, it's not hard to cause problems with a car
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.680]   if you have physical access to it.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.880]   I presume that they claimed they didn't,
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.040]   or they didn't need to.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   They did, in fact, have access to the author's car.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.520]   And I presume that they're waiting to DEF CON.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.600]   This is often what happens.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.200]   Certainly, Charlie Miller's MO is to hold off
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   on the big reveal until the big reveal.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.120]   I wonder if they'll be allowed to present it DEF CON
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.880]   if they really do have a method to do this.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.160]   Yeah, I wonder, too, because this
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.480]   is a step beyond a computer hack.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.440]   This is a step beyond taking over some of the browser.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.000]   This is definitely creating something
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.800]   that could threaten the lives of a lot of people.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.520]   This is a very limited access.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.840]   It's only Chrysler cars with sprint connections
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.360]   and 8.4-inch you connect navigation systems.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.600]   Well, but this hack.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.360]   Right, exactly.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.160]   So what else is a riskier term?
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.880]   Like, is this going to be pervasive across all Chrysler?
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.440]   Is all Portia's, Fiat's, whatever?
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.520]   Or is this more of a constrained to one kind of make
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.920]   of one company?
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.240]   It seems to be tied to that sprint connection somehow.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.480]   And I don't know exactly what the details are there.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.840]   Again, they haven't given us a lot of details
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.840]   of exactly how this works.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.280]   And I'm definitely very much looking forward
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.920]   to seeing what goes on at Black Hat, too.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.480]   But it seems to be tied to that sprint connection.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.400]   And as of now, the recall only affects those Chrysler cars
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.560]   with that 8.4-inch navigation system, which isn't upgrade.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.600]   So I'm guessing we're talking a very small percentage
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.080]   of Jeeps at this point.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.840]   But again, if indeed this is a hack
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.600]   that can be applied on that system,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.520]   if it applies to every sprint connection system,
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.960]   then that's almost a re-cryseler that's being sold today.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.880]   So there's, again, there's a lot of questions
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.560]   that are involved at this point that we don't have
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.120]   the answers for.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.640]   It's certainly serious enough that Chrysler decided
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   to put out a recall for those cars.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.200]   1.4 million cars.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.520]   Every car with a Uconnect system.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:54.280]   So it's 2013 Dodge Vipers, 2015 Dodge Challengers,
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.800]   Chrysler's not just Grand Cherokees.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.440]   Now maybe they're being extra prudent.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.680]   I'm guessing that they are, especially
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.960]   because it's such a simple thing.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.040]   And especially because they actually just today got hit
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.760]   with a $105 million fine for not being proactive enough
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.920]   when it came to similar to their safety recall.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.560]   So they're getting a couple of Black Eyes this week.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.000]   But I'm guessing they're trying to be able to proactive here.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.800]   And ultimately trying to apply this fix
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.760]   as broadly as they can.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.360]   Because ultimately it's just a software update.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.200]   And if they can get people to come into their dealerships,
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.360]   you know, that doesn't take any time at all
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.560]   to apply that kind of thing.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.760]   So in the future do we have like windows update for cars
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.720]   that we have to deal with every single like iTunes update?
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.040]   I mean, or is this more of a one-time use case?
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.920]   Yeah, you get that Tesla does it over the air, right?
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.240]   Right.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.320]   And then it happens in the background.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.440]   It's not the kind of thing that you even really necessarily
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:37.960]   know about.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.280]   You might boot up your car one morning
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.920]   and find out you've got new features
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.240]   that you didn't have the day before.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.480]   So that is already happening on that front.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.240]   And Tesla, you know, Tesla's made a huge investment in security.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.760]   I think it was last year they went to Black Hat.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.720]   And they sent a recruiter there and basically said,
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.360]   "Hire us 30 dues from Black Hat because we need some help."
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.480]   And that's pretty much what they did.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.600]   And because there were a lot of stories
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.520]   about Tesla exploits last year.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.600]   And I'm guessing that the link between the infotainment system
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.280]   and that CAN bus system, which is driving the actual guts
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.640]   of the car is probably a lot tighter than in other cars
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.520]   when you find it in Tesla.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.480]   So Tesla went on and got help.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.800]   And I think that ultimately we'll see a lot of that kind of thing
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.160]   from other major manufacturers in the near future.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.960]   Ultimately, you need to air gap the two systems.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.600]   I remember talking to Ford and Alan Malawi telling me they had,
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.760]   not necessarily air gaps.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.880]   See, this is the issue.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   They said, "Oh, no, no.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:31.440]   The Ford Sync is separate from the telematics
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.000]   and the stuff that runs the car.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.760]   But really the best separate is two separate buses.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.440]   There's no physical connection
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.920]   because you can't always rely on software to do this.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.400]   Two US senators have introduced a bill
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.640]   to set standards on vehicle security.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.280]   And the bill would also create a security rating system
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.720]   for cars, which is not a bad idea.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.080]   So you could actually see, among other things, how safe is this?
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.080]   What does that actually know about security
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.760]   to kind of help particular vision that would allow for that
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   to be decided or that kind of hacks?
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.600]   You know, I mean, I'm a little skeptical.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.520]   And driving a car into the wall and seeing how well it does,
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.120]   to spend anybody can figure out a good way to do that.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.560]   Unless they, again, go to Black Hat and hire a bunch of people
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.280]   to make this work, I've added down
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.880]   so that this sort of program could be successful.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.720]   But ultimately, I do think that the industry needs
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.640]   some kind of oversight, whether it be some kind of standards
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.360]   by that they themselves create or, you know, sort of that,
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.360]   the government may need to step in and make something happen.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.760]   But, you know, there's definitely been a lot to talk
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.560]   about how these systems are very, very strongly,
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.680]   not linked at all.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.000]   And I think this story proves that there is some kind of a link,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.040]   even if you need physical access to it.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.440]   And there shouldn't be, on sync in particular, you know,
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.880]   you can get access to some of the car's data
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.440]   from sync apps, for example.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.320]   Sync apps can read the vehicle speed and things like that.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.840]   So that means there is at least, excuse me,
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.600]   there is at least a read-only portion
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.480]   of that communication going on.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.840]   But as we've seen in many hacks before,
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.320]   read-only does not always stay read-only.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.560]   - I think Fiat's gonna have a trusted security award
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   after this past year.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.080]   - Yeah, yeah, it's really bad that it's a real bad
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.720]   fashion medicine, but a potential car.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.800]   And then for when I hack your car,
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.320]   it tells me that I cheated on your wife.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.160]   - It's great.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.680]   - It's really hard to-- - One to one connection.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.440]   - You started saying something.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.400]   - Oh, well, the best thing about the Senators is that
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.400]   they're saying that also you'll have to have a window sticker
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.840]   on new cars that will rank your security
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.200]   and privacy protections.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.760]   So you're gonna get a little ranking before you buy a car,
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.480]   so at least you'll know-- - A plus.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.840]   - What, exactly, exactly.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.480]   - Well, we joke so much now to talk about
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.240]   software eating the world.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.800]   I mean, this is software eating us,
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.920]   like we're not building it properly and effectively
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:34.760]   and safely enough.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.480]   So I feel like we're paying the price for
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.160]   moving quickly without proper security.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.920]   And that's a good thing overall,
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.000]   'cause we're building new stuff, but also,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.760]   no, we don't have these black-eyed guys.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.600]   We're gonna be kind of out to lunch, I feel.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.560]   - No, it's a huge problem.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.760]   We build it first and then we ask the questions of
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.800]   what are the security measures that we have to put in place
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.960]   afterwards, and it really should be the other way around.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.440]   - You can go to driveyouconnect.com if you are
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.920]   driving a Fiat Chrysler with you connect,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.000]   edit it in, and check for updates and download
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.400]   those updates on your USB key or take it to the dealer
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.080]   for the update.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.120]   - Yeah, your car dies, you didn't forget to do the oil
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.720]   or the gas, you're from the USB key.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.560]   That's what I look for in the morning when I go on my commute.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.760]   I think myself, ah, where's my USB key?
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.440]   No, I think that's kind of a lame way to go about this.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.920]   It tests like I can do OTA updates for firmware
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.920]   that I feel like everyone should be able
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.160]   to pull off the same thing.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.640]   They should not be the size of the problem that it is.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.840]   - Yeah.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.320]   Well, I think part of the problem is that,
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.440]   and Tim, I'm sure you agree, that cars are designed
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.640]   in a kind of a different timeframe
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.480]   than modern computer technology.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.960]   Takes a long time to make a new car.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.480]   - That a four or five year lifecycle,
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.040]   or design cycle, I should say, for a new car to come out.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.040]   And that's a very long time.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.520]   So you can imagine where smartphones were five years ago
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.080]   and that's what they were basically designing against.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.320]   There's been a lot of progress in the past couple of years
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.160]   where manufacturers are doing a better job.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.640]   And things like Android, Auto, and Carpler
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.400]   are making that easier too.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.480]   But ultimately, they're living in this very closed ecosystem
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.000]   where they're used to having all the keys to the castle
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.160]   and no one has any insight into what's going on.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.120]   And so it's very much like the earlier days
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.200]   of personal computing where when the first hacks
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.000]   started happening, these manufacturers were angry
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.360]   because these people were planning with their sacred systems.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.720]   That was very much what Chrysler's response was like.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.360]   These guys shouldn't be playing around in our systems
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.680]   because it's dangerous.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.840]   Well, people are going to do it.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.600]   They haven't had access to do that in the past,
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.120]   but now people do and they're going to make it happen.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.800]   And so it's going to be an eye-opening experience
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:30.960]   for a lot of these manufacturers.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.960]   And frankly, I hope they follow Tesla's direction
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.480]   and go out and hire the best hackers that they can
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.280]   and tell them to go crazy on their systems.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.440]   Because ultimately, that's the only way
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.160]   that these exploits are going to be found.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.640]   And as we get CarPlay and Android Auto in our cars,
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.960]   instead of making things better, make things worse,
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:52.600]   Rana Madio was on Twig this week talking about his review
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.880]   of Android Auto.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.880]   One of the things he pointed out, yes, you can plug in
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:02.400]   your modern Android phone and be able to use it on the screen.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.280]   But the software running on the car, he found,
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.400]   at least one of the cars he was using, was Gingerbread.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.160]   That they were using Android for the multimedia system
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.760]   in the car running, I guess it was a Hyundai Sonata,
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.240]   2015 Hyundai Sonata running Android 2.2.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.200]   What, yours that out?
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.600]   Originally.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.200]   Android 2.2 is, I think, four or five years old.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.640]   But that's exactly what you're saying.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:28.360]   That's the cycle.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.000]   They probably--
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:29.240]   That's insane.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.920]   That was the latest thing they had when they started
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.680]   the design of this car.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.400]   And they basically standardized things within companies
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.120]   so that they can plug in whatever the latest and greatest
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.200]   is toward the end of the design cycle of these cars.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.600]   But ultimately, a couple of years ago,
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.840]   Hyundai probably thought they were doing this hot new thing.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.680]   And ultimately, they kind of were that they had half it right.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   The Android idea was right.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.680]   But ultimately, this specific implementation is wrong.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.200]   Whether or not Android Auto and CarPlay
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.800]   prove to be security risks, that remains to be seen.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.640]   The penetration of those two systems
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.000]   is so small right now that we've got a long way to go.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.320]   In theory, those systems are not making any connections
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:07.080]   to the car except for things like GPS location and speed.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.400]   And that's about it.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.040]   But hackers may find a way to get into more
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.280]   vehicle information through those systems.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   And that could be another door into the system too
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.640]   for hackers.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.840]   Apologize.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.280]   It's not 2.2.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.120]   That's Froyo.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.800]   It's running Gingerbread 2.34.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.000]   Right.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   We're sorry everyone in the chat.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Sorry, we have to apologize.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Our honestly, Android has to run cut.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   It's not absolutely perfect.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.600]   We will say we're our children.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.760]   And Ron says, if it feels like a crappy 2011 Android tablet,
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:39.280]   it's because it is a crappy 2011 Android tablet.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.240]   But Tim, if people keep using Android in cars
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.680]   and are always so far behind in terms of what's new and what's
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.360]   safe, doesn't that always represent a security flaw or risk
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:48.720]   portal?
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.800]   I mean, I feel like you can't get away from that using
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.280]   a four-year-old open-source software.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.800]   I'd almost prefer you use QNX or something, right?
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.240]   Yeah, it certainly depends.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.560]   And QNX is certainly the foundation for quite a few of
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.240]   these systems.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.280]   And, you know, Cinq was originally built on Microsoft's
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.800]   Windows Embedded, which, you know, for all its pluses and
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.200]   minuses, at least that is a pretty closed system.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.280]   But now they switched over to QNX as well.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.480]   But ultimately, that's just the foundation.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.200]   At that point, you've got to build everything on top of it.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.120]   And it's what you build on top of it that really exposes you
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.720]   to these sorts of risks.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.360]   You know, I mean, kind of thing that Android Auto and CarPlay
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.160]   are going to be very secure systems and ultimately
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.480]   probably a lot more secure than what these manufacturers
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.400]   could come up with on their own because Google and Apple both
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.040]   have faced these sorts of challenges for years now.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.000]   And so I think that those things are going to be pretty solid.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.920]   And ultimately, you know, we're not far off from the point
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.880]   where nobody even really cares what these systems are doing
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.240]   so long as you can plug your phone in and so long as you can
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.600]   get CarPlay.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.280]   So long as you can do that, most people are going to be
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.320]   happy and they're not going to be using those systems anyway.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.840]   Do the teams building out these integrations instead of cars
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.960]   actually have the expertise to understand how security works?
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.640]   Are they more just grafting on Android to their cars
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.520]   with a bad touchscreen?
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.280]   Do they have the expertise or are they more just
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.320]   relevant?
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.160]   It definitely depends on the company.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.400]   Companies like GM, for example, has made a lot of hires
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.680]   from the consumer tech industry.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.600]   They've pushed a lot of people from HP, for example,
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.760]   on WebOS, from Google.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.960]   They make a lot of hires because I think they've finally
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.480]   come to the realization that all their embedded systems
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.440]   developers, you know, who've been building car systems for years
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.840]   don't really have the knowledge or the expertise when it comes,
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.720]   not only security, but also simple things like interfaces.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.280]   You know, our expectations for what a good interface is
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.600]   have skyrocketed over the past couple of years simply
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:23.960]   because of mobile phones.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.720]   And if your developers weren't kind of
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.720]   weaned in that environment, they might struggle there.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.440]   So they have been making quite a few smart hires.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.760]   And like I mentioned, Tesla's certainly
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.840]   been doing quite well there, too.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.120]   So I do think it's a challenge for them.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.720]   And they're also-- they've been working
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.880]   in a very closed environment.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.840]   These systems until just a year or two ago
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.720]   were very, very much proprietary systems
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.840]   so that each individual car might have completely different
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.640]   software than each other.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.400]   Now they're trying to embrace these open systems
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   and open source software.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.640]   And that's a very new thing for a lot of these developers.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.000]   So I think it's a mix.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.960]   And I think there's definitely quite a few risks there.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.120]   What do you know about the onboard diagnostics system?
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.200]   My car and my-- actually, all cars since the mid '90s
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.600]   have OBD2 ports that you can--
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.280]   I mean, I think they're intended for technicians to plug in.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.160]   But you can buy-- I bought a $30 dongle
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.760]   that plug into the OBD2 port.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:15.400]   And I use software on my phone to see how the engine's doing
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:15.840]   and all that.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.880]   Is this pretty secure?
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.200]   That is fairly secure in terms of what you can--
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.040]   basically, you can do a lot of reading from that port.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.560]   It's pretty hard to do writing.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.760]   You certainly can.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.960]   In fact, there are chip upgrades and that kind of thing
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.840]   that you can basically do from plugging into your OBD2 port
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.080]   and making changes to engine parameters.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.800]   So it is possible to do things like change
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.680]   throttle mappings and boost pressure
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.800]   if you have a turbocharged car.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.400]   You can do that kind of thing through the OBD2 port.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.640]   But primarily, the sorts of applications that we see
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.680]   are reading fuel mileage, speed, location
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.160]   and get location information from there as well.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.480]   So that is a fairly secure thing.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.800]   But again, if someone has access to that port
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.240]   and they've got physical hard access to your car.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.560]   And at that point, I would be very skeptical
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.080]   about what I'm plugging in there.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.960]   I have an OBD2 reader as well.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.880]   If I have a check engine line, I use it to see what the check
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.880]   engine code is.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.360]   But once I'm done with that, I pull it out.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:06.880]   And I sort of--
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.640]   Oh, you don't leave it in?
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.200]   Oh, I leave mine in.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.520]   Maybe I just lock her here to tell my friends.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.120]   It's going to not care at all.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.400]   But I start my car, a nice lady on the phone says,
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.880]   "Dash has started your drive."
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.880]   And then when I get there, it says, "Dash has ended your drive."
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.960]   And then it scores me.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.880]   It gives me grades.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.920]   It'll alert me.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:28.760]   It beefs at me when I hard accelerate
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.120]   our step on the brakes too hard.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:30.720]   I like that.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.920]   You could get a great B-minus driving, A-plus tailgating.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.320]   Well, I don't know if it knows about tailgating,
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.840]   but it knows about fuel efficiency and--
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.640]   Who's telling me stop driving, get out of the car?
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.920]   It has a G-offensive.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.800]   So is it the Apple Watch file from it saying,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.160]   "You went outside of where you're allowed to go."
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.080]   And I just have to set it to geofence.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.400]   Did your wife set that up for you?
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.920]   Maybe Lisa did that, actually.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:53.600]   I don't know.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.040]   It's like you can't go outside of Petaluma.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.040]   It's great if you're a teenager.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.320]   Because as you are, I know, Alex, because then--
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.440]   I mean, if you have a teenager, then you could--
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.400]   not if you are a teenager.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.280]   It's probably horrible if you're a teenager.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.440]   But if you have a teenager, you can actually monitor
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.360]   where they're going and stuff like that.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.400]   All right, when you were--
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.280]   So you're thinking I should not leave it plugged in, Tim?
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.560]   I wouldn't worry about that so much at this point.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.240]   I think you're probably OK, but definitely keep an eye
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.120]   on the news and see what's coming up.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.960]   Because that is definitely effectively
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.520]   creating a physical access to your car,
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.240]   some sort of physical access to your car.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.680]   And that's all that a lot of hackers
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.600]   would need to get in there.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.640]   And for example, pull down information
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.280]   about the wireless keys that I was talking about before.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.000]   And that kind of thing, they could find out basically
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.760]   through a man in the middle attack on your wireless key.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.240]   I figured if somebody's got access to my car,
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.400]   they're going to bring their own OBD2 device.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.960]   They don't have the same as I want to leave mine in.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.880]   And again, they could crawl into the car
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.040]   and they just cut-- that's why I have one of those mirrors
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.840]   so I can look at it in my car before I get in.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.360]   Smart.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.320]   Yeah, just like a customer.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.320]   No, what do you think?
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.880]   He's checking for IEDs.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.240]   We all have to tell him I was back.
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.240]   Come on.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   Let me scan you.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.480]   He's getting a team, I think.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.440]   He's getting around.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.920]   We were talking about QNX.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.600]   There's good news for Blackberry.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.960]   In honor of Georgia Dow, our Canadian
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.800]   will be a little Blackberry news.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.480]   It's been a long time since I've said that on the show.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.240]   Before that, though, by the way, thank you, Georgia,
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   for being here from iMore.com.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:18.720]   Thank you for having me.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:23.240]   She lives in Johnny Ives' white room.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.520]   You do have decor, though.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.160]   You have these great little--
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.320]   they're kind of subtle lighted backdrop things.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:31.680]   I love that.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.240]   I love that.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:32.720]   Thank you.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.800]   Nice.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.480]   Also with his--
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.680]   Full attack, really.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.760]   Pardon me?
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.120]   It's really low-tech, actually.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.160]   Yeah, it looks good, though.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.040]   It's cool.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.240]   Also here Tim Stevens from his Naughty Pine cabin in the woods.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.000]   Also very low-tech.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.520]   I hope it also looks OK.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.520]   I love getting you on, Tim.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.080]   It's great to see you again from Seam--
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.440]   Great to be right.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.280]   Thank you.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.360]   Do you spend most of your time up there?
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.120]   Or you travel a lot?
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.280]   I do travel quite a bit.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.240]   I've been in Detroit a bunch lately.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.520]   So yeah, I'm on the road quite a bit.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.640]   You couldn't have picked a better beat.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.320]   I know it's your passion anyway.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   Tim raises.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.400]   What do you raise?
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.520]   Motorcycle, I have a Yamaha R6.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.160]   I used to do some carting, but I get out of that.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.320]   And then in the winter months, I'm doing ice racing.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.840]   I need to make my Subaru up my legs.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.760]   Ice racing, I assume.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.520]   What needs?
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.040]   Ice racing.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:19.840]   I have the angels.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.160]   On the ice.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.080]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:22.920]   This guy's great.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.720]   I don't think we're cool enough for that.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.040]   I don't think you have the gravitas to pull it off.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.120]   I have Mario Kart.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.240]   He has an actual cart.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.480]   There's a big difference right there.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.800]   So nice to have you, Tim.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.840]   And you did pick a big beat, because this is--
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.480]   I think this is just the beginning.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.240]   We'll be talking a lot about telematics and car systems
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.400]   and car security over the next few years.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.400]   This is going to be a fun story.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.800]   And Alex Wilhelm, what's your beat at TechCrunch?
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.160]   Things I find interesting.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.560]   Usually.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.440]   Anything you want?
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:50.960]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.800]   A lot of finance, policy, some Bitcoin, couple startups,
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.720]   little enterprise, Microsoft, and Kuvamix.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.320]   Just things that I want to write about.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.800]   Article in the New York Times this week saying Bitcoin
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.720]   is the preferred choice for people who are blackmailing.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.480]   Well, this will actually Madison up
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.720]   and see how that transfers going.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.960]   I don't-- you know, I have seven Bitcoins.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960]   That's like $14, $1,500.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.160]   Yeah, it was a lot more of a rich man on the show.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.600]   It was a lot-- well, we actually--
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600]   How did you lose?
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.200]   I don't know.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.560]   I don't keep track of it.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.240]   But you know who has a lot?
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.560]   Steve Gibson has 50, because he starts a Bitcoin mining
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.680]   in the early days.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.520]   And it's like a little thing into the cup.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.960]   He got 50 Bitcoins.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.160]   That's 20 Gs right now.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:30.680]   It's 20 Gs.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:30.880]   I know.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.920]   It was a lot more when it was $1,500 for a big one.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.160]   Is he buying lunch after the show?
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:34.680]   I think he ought to.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   I think he actually is.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.240]   He was up to $75,000.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.840]   That's like a really good Vegas weekend right there.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.680]   No kidding.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.680]   That's some serious fun.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.280]   For nothing.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:43.720]   Well, no--
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.680]   Now you can't do that.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.760]   You can't do Bitcoin mining.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.600]   Well, you can't if you have an industrial operation,
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.240]   you know, warehouse, science, all that.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.200]   It's got a basics and all this fancy equipment.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.560]   These together would do nothing.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.520]   We get no Bitcoin at all.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.160]   No one likes us.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.600]   It's OK.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.040]   Did they ever--
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:57.600]   OK, I'm sorry.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.560]   I got on that tangent.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.880]   Did they ever-- Bitcoin tangent.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.120]   Ah, here we go.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.320]   Debunk that Newsweek article claiming they found Satoshi Nakamoto.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.960]   Yeah, that was crap in the end.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.280]   They just harassed some poor guy.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.560]   They just harassed some poor guy.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:11.600]   Poor guy.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:11.960]   That's so terrible.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.360]   And it was the coverage story on Newsweek.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.360]   And I haven't heard any apologies.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.680]   Well, Newsweek tried to--
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.720]   didn't matter.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.440]   Didn't matter.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440]   Tried to matter again.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:19.960]   Failed.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.720]   And not as a matter.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.880]   And their own by IBT.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.680]   Yeah, but I mean, if they--
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.000]   And they went back to print, and that
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.120]   was their first print episode.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.080]   But they never apologized.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.920]   They just went on.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.560]   No, they were like, our sources are strong.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.800]   Oops, JK.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.720]   And then you move on.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.320]   It's like Gawker.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.520]   It's like, oh, wow.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.160]   I'm not just that.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:33.400]   Nope.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.720]   No, no, no.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.120]   I have no comments on Gawker at all.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   No, no, no, no.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.640]   I endorse free speech.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.720]   And that's all I'm saying.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.000]   Really?
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.120]   I'm trying to dodge Leo.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:42.640]   OK.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.120]   I'll let you dodge.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.160]   I'll let you dodge.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.360]   Meanwhile, I'll talk about shaving.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.120]   Do you ever take a razor to that noggin?
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.520]   I just bit over the bathtub and trade it off with the--
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.280]   With electric?
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:51.920]   Yeah, it clippers.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.280]   Sometime you ought to get a Harry's.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.200]   And the luxury of--
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:56.840]   I have my hair.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.080]   You know what?
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.840]   I'm going to give you.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.200]   I forget you got punked or something.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:00.800]   This is what--
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.760]   No, I'm going to give you--
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.440]   I'm going to do a shave my head on the show.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:03.960]   I've got time.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.920]   You can do it on air.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.560]   We could.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.920]   Do you want to?
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.560]   I would.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:07.760]   I would.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.680]   Go for it.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.200]   Really?
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:09.720]   Why not?
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.800]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.720]   I have that some bad experiences with--
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.600]   Weekly and air.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.040]   Hey, head shaving.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:15.520]   Not good.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.760]   It's a little bit of post-traumatic stress.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.640]   I do.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.520]   And I'm so glad I go back.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.520]   I have some little hair to begin with.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.440]   I feel like it wouldn't even do that much for a problem.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.760]   But you could-- this is what's weird.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.120]   You could have a full head of hair.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:24.600]   Not really.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.200]   It's a little lame in the front, a little weak,
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.400]   and a little hair, kind of crappy.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:33.920]   So you just decided to--
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.840]   It's my personal worth.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.080]   It's all I've got.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.560]   Well, you've got a lot.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.960]   For some of your age, it's having impressive
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.480]   coif going on there.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.320]   You know, like this is--
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.560]   That was an underrated compliment.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.560]   Silver.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, give me the silver fox of choice.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.800]   Someone of my age.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.920]   It's the Bill Clinton hair.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.160]   You know, I still shave every day, too.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.200]   And that's why I'm glad I got Harry's.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.360]   Let me tell you what a discovery Harry's was.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:01.040]   These guys, one of them, Jeff was one of the founders
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:01.800]   of Warby Parker.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.720]   He specializes, as a lot of entrepreneurs do these days,
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.840]   in disruption, in finding businesses that
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.800]   aren't working for people and making them work better.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.560]   And of course, as anybody who's ever gone to the drug store
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.280]   to buy a razor blade knows, these things are so overpriced,
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.840]   they're locked up.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.440]   You have to get in the tenant's unlock.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.320]   It's like gold.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.680]   Instead of buying a $4 blade, a Gillette Fusion blade,
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.120]   how about half as much for a better blade?
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.160]   Now, how do I know it's better?
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.160]   Because Harry's bought the factory.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.480]   They wanted to make blades that were designed for performance,
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.720]   that were designed for reliability.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.600]   And they decided the only way to do it
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.360]   was to actually buy the factory, one of the two blade
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.960]   factories, in Germany.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.760]   They make their own blades, engineering them
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.840]   for sharpness and high performance.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.800]   And then they ship them free to your front door.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.560]   So by course, before you start the Harry subscription,
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.920]   you've got to get the Harry's kit.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.840]   There's two kits.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.880]   The Winston and the Truman, if you go to Harry's h-a-r-r-y
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.680]   as.com, take a look at the kits.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.520]   Very affordable, the Winston set,
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.680]   which I'm holding right now, it can be engraved.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.400]   It's a metal handle.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.240]   It's really elegant and beautiful.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:12.360]   But, and Steve Gibson prefers the Truman set
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.440]   because he likes the warmth of the plastic
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.400]   and he knows how the handle's oriented.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.920]   So you should certainly look at that.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.840]   And at 15 bucks, it's very affordable.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.680]   What do you get?
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.440]   You get the handle, you get three blades,
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.560]   and you get Harry, your choice of Harry's new foaming shave gel
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.200]   or the original Harry's cream.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.920]   The gel, you know, a lot of people are gel users nowadays.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.360]   The gel is, well, whoops.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.080]   (laughing)
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.640]   I got a little bit on the table there.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.480]   The gel smells good, it feels good,
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.920]   and it smooths the blades.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.520]   So you get a clean, close, comfortable shave.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.080]   You can get the gel and the blades delivered,
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.560]   as I said, for free shipping to your door.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.840]   It costs about half as much as the razors in the store.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.840]   Smells great.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.080]   They have a new aftershave moisturizer too.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.080]   It protects and hydrates your skin.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.120]   Harry's, it won't give you a, look, there it is.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.800]   My shave cream.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.720]   Five dollars off your first purchase
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.160]   with the offer code TWIT5.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.120]   So that means 10 bucks for your starter kit.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.240]   That's a good deal.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.160]   10 bucks for the Truman.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.040]   Harry's.com uses the offer code TWIT
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.280]   and the number five at checkout.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.880]   This is persistent stuff.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.120]   The foam, if you can't see, will not leave the table
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:23.960]   or his hands.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:24.800]   But that's why it's so good.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.800]   I'm gonna shave your head.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.520]   You don't want foam, you don't want wimpy foam.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.960]   You want serious hard core foam.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.640]   Yeah, this is the job low of foam, if you will.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.520]   It's the job low of foam.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.480]   It will wash off.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.400]   I would hope so, 'cause you're stuck with it now.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.280]   So it's literally his hands.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.120]   There's their covered in cream.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.320]   And you can't undo it.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.960]   So let's talk about QNX.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.880]   We were talking about QNX and that's owned by Blackberry.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.240]   It's actually a pretty good asset,
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.760]   given that most of the cars are now gonna use QNX
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.440]   for their operating systems.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.480]   Yeah, they were smart to buy that.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.120]   And Blackberry has a couple of other stories.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.560]   They just acquired another company.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.720]   I'm not sure what they do.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:09.720]   It's called ATHOC, not AdHOC, but ATHOC.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.160]   They're an emergency mass messaging service.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.880]   Are they just trying to buy different cash flows
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.560]   out there to kind of give their business a float?
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.780]   'Cause these are not things that are
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.600]   called the Blackberry software.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.320]   QNX is in, unless you maybe made it
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.680]   part of your new operating system.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.560]   Although, Blackberry 10 is pretty--
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.680]   Talk about burning platforms.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.080]   But it's something they're buying different revenue.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.320]   PEGS have underneath their company
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.440]   as they try to transition away from being
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.680]   a mobile provider.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.360]   But--
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.200]   Yours are--
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.040]   Yours are--
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:37.880]   Yours are at ATHOC does.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.720]   It's used by the Department of Defense
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.040]   and the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.840]   It enables the exchange of emergency alerts
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.560]   between devices from iPhones to warning sirens.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.760]   They have--
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.960]   I think they've been kind of building
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.360]   their security portfolio a little bit.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.520]   And maybe this is tied in, maybe not,
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.080]   but they just got Department of Defense approval
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.040]   for their PKI, Public Key Infrastructure Credentials,
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.160]   which means that Blackberries can continue to be used
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.200]   in the Department of Defense
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.040]   in other places where security is important.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.360]   You got it as a Canadian, I don't know.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.520]   Am I overgeneralizing Georgia?
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.360]   But it seems--
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.840]   You might be overgeneralizing.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.480]   I do feel a certain amount of love to Blackberry
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.320]   because it's Canadian.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.320]   There's a certain amount there.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.120]   I still use my iPhone.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.080]   But no, I think that it's great if Blackberry really runs
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.000]   the security route and they're secure.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.080]   I think that that's a pull.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.680]   I think that people, as more and more hacks,
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.480]   are coming out and people are thinking,
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.360]   you know what, this is something that's really important.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.560]   So if the Department of Homeland Security
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.840]   is going to use a Blackberry--
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.160]   Oh, maybe.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.040]   It would be a smart move, I think.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.240]   It would be a very smart move.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.600]   I mean, they've always-- Blackberry's always
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.080]   pushed the security angle.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.840]   And you'd be very smart to persist with it.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.040]   Although I understand that one of the Blackberry--
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.080]   one country has just decided to shut down Blackberry
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:04.720]   in their country.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.720]   I'm not sure if it was--
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.520]   I forget what you put to India somewhere.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.640]   Their shares are on 29% your to date, if I recall correctly.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.320]   It's not really--
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:11.320]   Wow.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.200]   And that's from further declines in the past.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.920]   They're really not having a good time with it.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.680]   Do we think these purchases are going to allow them to regain
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.920]   their luster or these really just kind of death throes
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.440]   of a dying candy and disaster?
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.080]   I think they could reinvent themselves.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.440]   I really do.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.360]   We actually had a great interview on triangulation
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.680]   with a woman who'd written the book.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.160]   She works at the Globe and Mail in Toronto
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.320]   and written the book on the story of Blackberry.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.960]   And I think--
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.040]   Pakistan is shutting down Blackberry services
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:43.000]   by December over security, which probably means the Pakistan
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.960]   government cannot crack the Blackberry message system.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960]   That's another pro.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.360]   Yeah, right?
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.000]   I agree with Georgia.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.400]   I mean, if a totalitarian government shuts on a service
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.360]   for security reasons, it means they couldn't get even.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:56.800]   That's a big buy.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.000]   Five years ago, India threatened to do the same.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.160]   And Blackberry at the time probably mistakenly gave
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.240]   India the source code for the Blackberry enterprise.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.840]   What a terrible idea.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.520]   Yeah, I think a terrible idea.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.600]   UAE, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia,
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.680]   of all complaining that Blackberry is too secure.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.440]   I love all those countries are known for their sport
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.840]   of free speech and free discourse,
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.120]   and freedom of relation, all that.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.680]   They're completely open societies.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.920]   They're all countries that monitor the internet.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.920]   Wait a minute, so does ours.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.720]   Can we vote the NSA out of the government?
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.120]   Let's have a referendum on the people.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   I would love to do that.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:30.960]   I would love to do that.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.320]   It can be the vote though.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.400]   I complained about this, and everybody said,
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.800]   what a first world problem.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.120]   If this is all you're worried about, you really need a life.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.000]   Twitter took my background away.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.520]   I mean, this actually matters.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.080]   I think it matters as much as actually Madison.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.520]   Well, for us it matters more especially
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.720]   use Twitter and actually Madison.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.640]   But I mean, I had a nice customized background.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.520]   With your face on it.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.720]   My face was on it.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.480]   There you go.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.040]   Now, if I tweet, and somebody shares the tweet,
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.280]   it still has my background.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:04.160]   But Twitter, I think a lot of people thought this was a bug,
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.760]   but no, Twitter's decided to go all white.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.680]   That sounds not quite what you wanted to say,
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:09.640]   but all white backgrounds.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.000]   It's a tremendous--
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.720]   All white background.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.400]   I feel like Twitter has a long history
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.760]   of making changes to its platform
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.840]   that its users don't like.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.600]   I mean, we don't Twitter forever, right?
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.320]   It's such a weird change to make.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.560]   Yeah, but it's one they could have signal discussed,
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.720]   talked about, and kind of brought.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.920]   So some people said, well, why don't you just use TweetDeck,
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.720]   and then you don't have to worry about that.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.080]   Here's what you're using right there.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:29.600]   Right there.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.960]   And you have a black background on that.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.600]   I have a black background on TweetDeck.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.960]   See, some people don't like--
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.440]   when we changed our website to have a white background,
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.800]   I think people live in caves.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.000]   They said, oh, it burns.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.200]   It burns.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.480]   I got a lot of-- Open the window.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480]   I got a lot of email.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.040]   Like you have a light from the sun.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.360]   Use that on your toes.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.800]   It's too bright, man.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.760]   So I can only imagine the emails Twitter got.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.520]   Here's the conspiracy theory.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:52.960]   Yeah, right?
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.640]   DMs.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.960]   Here's a conspiracy theory I'll give you.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.680]   They want to do ads on that background.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.880]   They want to do takeovers.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.920]   They want to use that space on the website.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.280]   And some people say, well, who uses Twitter's website anymore?
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.640]   Don't you use the Twitter client?
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.480]   Well, Twitter doesn't want you to use Twitter clients.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.600]   They want you to use the website.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.920]   So they bought TweetDeck originally.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.120]   They went and controlled the platform.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.240]   They don't like that.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.000]   They don't control the campaign, but ads on Twitter.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   They can't put ads.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.520]   And so I'm thinking that's where they're going with this.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.920]   If that's the case, then they're the dumbest company
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.600]   of all time.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.080]   If you put an ad on the background of my Twitter page,
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.600]   I have to endorse that product implicitly.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.200]   And they've arrived no control of my own internal--
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.400]   You would stop using it.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.480]   Well, no, I'm addicted.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.360]   But I would complain vociferously on Twitter about Twitter.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.520]   And maybe DM myself and kind of a meta.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.120]   Do you use TweetDeck as your regular client?
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.120]   Yeah, I run a 30-inch Apple monitor at the office.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.960]   And it's always there with the columns.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.680]   Tim, what do you do?
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.120]   Same thing.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.400]   Yeah, I do TweetDeck.
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.360]   And I do have a separate monitor for this one.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.520]   Monster list?
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.000]   Good man.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:49.960]   It's the way to go.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.360]   Once you go to that one, you can't go back to Tweetbot
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.000]   or Apple Tweet, whatever the hell it's called.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.080]   I actually love Tapbot.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.760]   Tapbot's Tweetbot, whatever it's called.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.760]   I use Tweetbot as well.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.040]   Though I'm not a huge tweet.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.640]   Look, I tweet if I have to tweet.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.000]   I don't tweet a lot.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.520]   I mean, if they make you, you'll tweet,
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.680]   but not unless they make you.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:07.880]   Right.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.680]   If there's not an article out or we're
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.560]   about to like do a podcast, I'll tweet that out
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.320]   or I'll chat a little bit.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.760]   But I actually get stressed because I'm Canadian.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.680]   So I feel like you have to reply to everyone.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.680]   Oh.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.160]   So if I get something that's really popular,
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.720]   I end up getting like maybe like there's 50 or 100 people
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.360]   that reply to me.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.240]   And then I feel like I have to say something back
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.240]   because they spent the time.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.600]   And then I get this anxiety.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.080]   Right.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:31.600]   Right.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.960]   And then when do you end the conversation?
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.480]   Twitter is not for a nice, pretty thing.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:36.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:15:09.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:16.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:23.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:30.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:37.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:44.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:51.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:58.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:05.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:12.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:19.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:26.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:59.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:06.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:13.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:20.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:34.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:41.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:56.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:03.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:15.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:22.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:29.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:41.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:49.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:56.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:08.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:23.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:28.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:43.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:50.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:55.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:20:02.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:10.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:17.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:29.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:37.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:44.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:54.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:09.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:14.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:21.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:29.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:36.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:41.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:48.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:56.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:03.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:15.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:23.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:35.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:40.480]   And I'm going to say it's a nice thing.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:49.480]   Well, that's what we're talking about, the final bits that you would normally send to OEMs so they can install it on computers and then ship the computers out the door.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:54.480]   Wednesday, I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.480]   I don't think anybody is.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:05.480]   Many people who are running Windows 7 and 8 have already gotten the little icon in their system tray that says, would you like to reserve your copy of Windows?
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.480]   I did.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:12.480]   Yes, we think that some of those bits may already be arriving on your hard drive.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.480]   But Wednesday, you will give them the opportunity to install them.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.480]   You do not have to install them right away.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.480]   It is a free upgrade in the sense that it's free.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.480]   You own Windows 10 now.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:27.480]   The only caveat maybe is that you have to install all updates going forward.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   You can defer them for a little bit.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.480]   Certainly.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:37.480]   You ultimately have to install updates.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.480]   This is one of the best roll out of a Windows version in my lifetime.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   Back from '95 up.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:49.480]   They managed to screw the communications so badly that a good launch is now confusing and causing discord among the blogosphere, which is what I do.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:55.480]   I feel like they're doing the right thing technologically, but they're screwing up the actual communications and explanation of it.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:00.480]   Because if we're not sure this close to launch, what's actually happening, they've screwed up.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.480]   Because we're not that dumb.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.480]   We're just half dumb.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:06.480]   Well, people like Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therat are hosting Windows weekly.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.480]   They spend their life covering Windows and they don't know what's going on.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:13.480]   Yeah, and if Mary Jo and Paul don't know, no one knows.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.480]   One knows.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.480]   Like, yeah, compared to them, me and you were just...
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.480]   So there are lots of questions.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:24.480]   We will kind of on Wednesday, we'll be doing Windows weekly, and we'll be, I'm sure as we go answering questions about this.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.480]   But I think I now have the final version of...
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:34.480]   I was a Windows Insider. I installed a beta on my Dell XPS, and then it automatically updated it to 10 to 40.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.480]   So I think you can tell by the eerie light shining in from the basement.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.480]   I feel like this looks like I'm in the basement.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.480]   And looking out the window here before...
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.480]   It's like a point and click adventure game.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   You should be able to click around to find clues and things.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.480]   They put a video about how they made that shot, actually, to be the main guy.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.480]   Yeah, they put up a video about how they made that shot to be the main background.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   That's not CG.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.480]   That's actually lights and windows and stuff.
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.480]   Why even bother doing that?
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.480]   Why? Because they have a lot of money on the board.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.480]   Why not just...
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.480]   You could do that in Illustrator in about five minutes.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.480]   Yeah, but that wouldn't be pure.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.480]   A single malt has to be single malt.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.480]   What's wrong with you, sir?
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.480]   It's kind of like Apple with the Apple Watch, right?
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:22.480]   They actually put an aquarium in the Apple campus with full of jellyfish and shot them in super high speed cameras
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.480]   to get those jellyfish animations in the Apple Watch.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:30.480]   Microsoft and Apple have combined $299 billion in cash as of the last quarter.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.480]   I don't think they really care.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.480]   Yeah, I would buy all sorts of crazy stuff.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.480]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:39.480]   I almost got the desk jellyfish just for my office because I could.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.480]   Is there a desk jellyfish?
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.480]   They are.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   Is the same what?
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.480]   They're...
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.480]   It's like the Apple jellyfish...
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.480]   The moon jellyfish and they light up by a city.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   Is it a screen saver?
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.480]   No, I was going to get a real fish tank with jellyfish for my office.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.480]   Your therapy office?
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.480]   My therapy office.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.480]   Aren't you worried that people might have an adverse reaction?
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   I've never dealt with jellyfish phobia, so I think that I do think.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.480]   I'm never in a trigger warning for jellyfish.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.480]   You know, it's never been up there on the list.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.480]   Not yet.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.480]   I just feel...
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.480]   You feel a little too dr. No for me.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.480]   I'm going to my therapist, the evil dr. No.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.480]   Right.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.480]   We have to feed each one.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.480]   The kicker to me was that I had to feed each one with this little tiny beaker and actually
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.480]   hand feed each jellyfish.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.480]   I was like, "You know what?
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.480]   That's too much effort for jellyfish."
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480]   So that was it.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.480]   What do you feed them?
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   Small rodents?
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.480]   It's little tiny fish pellets.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   So, yeah.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   But with a...
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.480]   With a dropper?
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.480]   How do you drop a pellet?
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.480]   Yes.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.480]   With an eye dropper.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:47.480]   And then you have to bring your hand into the bowl and make sure that they've actually eaten
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.480]   them because these jellyfish...
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.480]   The moon jellyfish or not is intelligent as I guess other jellyfish.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.480]   So they won't.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.480]   How can they be intelligent?
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:54.480]   They're jelly!
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.480]   Also, if you're a dumb jellyfish, you're right up there with the rest of them.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.480]   You're really dumb.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.480]   That's like, you know, it's odd to us.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.480]   It's like, "I'm smarter than you.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.480]   I'm celery."
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.480]   Dumb for a jellyfish.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.480]   Wow.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.480]   That is really bad.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.480]   It's like, it's like, mashable.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:06.480]   It's...
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.480]   Oh!
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.480]   Hi-o!
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.480]   Oh, come on.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.480]   Come on.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.480]   We have one zinger in here.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.480]   Come on, guys.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.480]   All right.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.480]   All right.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.480]   How about you, Tim Stevens?
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.480]   Windows or Mac?
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.480]   I am coming to you from a Windows machine right now.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.480]   How do you want to be on tape?
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.480]   I am too.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.480]   You know, I was really not thrilled with Windows 8.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.480]   8.1 fixed some of the problems.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.480]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.480]   But it was such a weird hybrid of a desktop and a tablet operating system.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:36.480]   And I think Microsoft heard us and is making it a little bit more your choice.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.480]   So if you want to run it at Windows 10 as a tablet, you can.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:44.480]   And if you run it as a desktop operating system, boot to the desktop, have a start menu,
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.480]   all the stuff that we love about Windows, then you can.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.080]   And I think that's really probably the right way to do it.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.080]   Have you...
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.080]   Were you in...
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.080]   Did you do the beta or are you waiting?
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:59.080]   No, I haven't had the chance to do the beta, but I should be installing it Monday actually.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.280]   And I'm looking forward to checking it out and spending some time with it.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.480]   You know, I've haven't really been that happy with Windows 8.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.360]   It's been fine, but I use it exactly like I used Windows 7.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.480]   So it's just more clicks to get to the same stuff that I ever did before.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.480]   I don't really use any apps available through the Windows App Store.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:20.480]   You know, I'm not really into only being able to put apps on a third of my screen or anything like that.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.480]   So, you know, I'm definitely very much looking forward to seeing how they've kind of taken a step
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:31.480]   into a more traditional Windows environment for Windows 10, but yet hopefully bringing in some of the cooler things of Windows 8.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.480]   Since why do you say this was such a good launch, Alex, for Windows, the best launch ever?
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.480]   Well, I mean, if you look at the way they did 7 and 8 and even 8.1,
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.480]   Windows 7 launch party, they sent me playing cards and balloons.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:44.480]   Did you actually use them?
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.480]   Yeah, I did it on the air and we installed Windows 7 together.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.480]   Did you dance to Jake pronounce what was going on?
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:53.480]   And actually, I loved Windows 7. I thought it was the best version of Windows ever.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:57.480]   It was until now, I feel. But what did Windows 8 do? Did they do anything to acknowledge it?
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:01.480]   Windows 8 was Steve Znovsky's pipe dream that essentially led to, that's your done.
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.480]   Updates were installed.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:07.480]   But with 10, I honestly feel like they've actually been so public, so open, so clear.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.480]   But what they're doing in response and feedback and fixes and so forth, they've actually built a better OS,
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.480]   because we've all been part of it.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.480]   And the Windows inside our program is about 5 million people that are doing this.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:22.480]   So instead of it being kind of a mystery about what we're going to get, we know where it is, how strong it is, how safe it is.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:26.480]   And so when they now put it out, we're not going to be surprised or confused by it, which is an upgrade.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.480]   You know, with a lot of these former launches, they just were like, "Here's what you get, you will like it."
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.480]   And now they're saying, "Hey, what do you want? We'll make it for you."
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:33.480]   Right.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.480]   So it's a real change in how you build code. I think it's going to be better. I'm not entirely sure.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.480]   But certainly I feel like they're moving the right direction.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.480]   But this last little launch cycle itself has been a mess.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.480]   But that's their PR problem, not mine.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.480]   Whatever.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:52.480]   It is interesting that Microsoft is giving away what were the crown jewels, the things that they made money on,
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:59.480]   which was Windows. And in some ways they're giving away Office, although you still buy it, but you can get Office online.
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:00.480]   And it's pretty capable.
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:05.480]   Yeah, but they're not giving away Windows 10. If you already have a Windows license, you can now upgrade.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.480]   You can buy a new PC, the OEM is still paying for that. If you want to buy it in the box, you're supposed to pay for that.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.480]   So it's not free.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:11.480]   If you're a business, you're paying for it.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:15.480]   Absolutely. And so that's not much of a change. So the business model has now changed, but not completely torn apart.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   They do want to build a service-based offering, but they're probably four or five years away from that.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.480]   They actually mean economically viable to replace old OEM revenues for Windows itself.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.480]   Right.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:29.480]   But you have to start somewhere. And they can't just, whole cloth, start again, because it's like $20 billion in revenue.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.480]   So you can't just deprecate that right off the bat.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.480]   Right. We'll see.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:36.480]   They could. They lost $7.5 billion on Nokia.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.480]   $7.6 billion right off for Microsoft.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.480]   Oh, my heavens. Unbelievable.
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.480]   Someone's like Stephen Yalp wasn't a good at business.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.480]   Shockingly enough.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.480]   Yeah. Who would have thought?
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:52.480]   Amazon did all right. Of course, speaking of quarterly results, Amazon surprised everybody by making money this quarter.
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:58.480]   It's my understanding that Amazon kind of controls those styles. They can make money or not, depending on,
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.480]   you know, what they want. But they reported a 92 million.
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.480]   That's not a lot for Amazon. $92 million profit for the quarter,
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:11.480]   ending June 30th. Investors expected a loss.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.480]   Yes.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:17.480]   So, of course, the stock market went wow, and ended 10% higher on Thursday.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:19.480]   Sales up 20%.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   So they made $92 million, but they sold $23.28 billion worth of stuff.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.480]   Yep.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.480]   Unbelievable.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:32.480]   That's not a very good margin. If you're doing the math out there, it's kind of weak, actually.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   Right.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:38.480]   But I mean, if you expected to be a loss and you grow faster on revenue and beat on profit, that's very good for the street.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.480]   So that's what their share is spiked. But I mean, you're still very correct that they're spending so much money to grow.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.480]   Their revenue is not that inexpensive on a short-term basis.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:49.480]   Yeah. So they want to do grocery stores.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.480]   Why?
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.480]   I love this idea. I love this idea.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:59.480]   Drive up grocery stores. The first one will be in Silicon Valley.
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.480]   Well, how does this work?
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:07.480]   You online, go online, pick out what you want, and then drive up and get it.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:12.480]   Well, that's kind of neat. So you've already ordered it, and do they have it like in little boxes ready for you to pick up and all that?
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:18.480]   Probably little droids are going to be sending them down to the car.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:28.480]   Here in the States, most grocery stores, I think, do offer delivery. We use Safeway, and they'll come and they'll deliver for fairly low fee.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:32.480]   So why would I do this instead of getting my grocery store to actually bring it to me?
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:44.480]   You see, we don't have-- I don't have delivery here at grocery stores. You can call to order, but then you have to actually go put all the boxes into your car yourself and then bring it home and unload.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:49.480]   So I would love to be able to just drive up, have it already set for me, and then bring it home.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.480]   If they would deliver it to my door, I think that that would be a much better benefit.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:58.480]   So I think that that's not a greater thing for Amazon to get involved with if you already have home delivery.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:01.480]   Is there Instacartes in Canada? No.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.480]   We don't have any of that stuff.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:07.480]   All right. Well, because you described Instacart, essentially right there as a model, and it's working very well down here.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.480]   All right.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.480]   What do you-- you're in San Francisco, so you presumably have many choices.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.480]   I don't really cook. So you just eat out? Yeah, pretty much.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:16.480]   So, yeah.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.480]   That's why I have this glorious double chin you're seeing on this camera now.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:22.480]   So actually you drive throughs you already go to drive throughs.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.480]   My car lives in Oregon. I don't have a parking spot. Wow.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:26.480]   Yeah, dude.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:30.480]   Parking is so bad in San Francisco. Alex had to park in Oregon.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:35.480]   Yeah, it's kind of a hike down the 101 for like, maybe 7,000 miles.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   I feel terrible.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.480]   No, between a parking spot from Monten, Assurance and gas and maintenance, another parking.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.480]   I was like, I'll just take a look at this. I live in the city. I do mass transit.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.480]   You bet. Wait, what?
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:46.480]   No, you can do that. No, you don't take the immunity?
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:49.480]   Take the 47 bus one day and tell me how that goes.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.480]   You know, for 13 years, they lift the rest of the time.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.480]   You lift it? I lift it.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.480]   I did, sir. Yeah, or Uber it.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.480]   Not Uber? I lift. Yeah. I don't like Travis that much.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:02.480]   Yeah, I mean, I would go lift. I'm just nervous about the mustaches.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.480]   Mm. You don't ride them.
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:08.480]   Huh? What? You don't ride them.
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.480]   You're supposed to let the joke pass away. Thank you. I'm moving on.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.480]   Gotcha.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:17.480]   The one plus two is on its way. We'll talk a little bit about that.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.480]   And you are according to Bloomberg News are now liable for your butt dials.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.480]   We'll find out what that means.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:28.480]   And just a little bit and AT&T and Direct TV are now one.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:32.480]   But there were some pretty stringent requirements from the FCC.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.480]   Why, you wrote that article, Alex Wilhelm.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:36.480]   What's you of all people? I co-wrote it.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.480]   All right. I co-wrote. I wrote two of the paragraphs.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.480]   When you co-write. Yes.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:46.480]   Does somebody give you the facts and you, you know, masterfully carve them into a
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.480]   pro story? We're on a deadline. My intern for the summer is writing or intern.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.480]   Your intern wrote? Our intern. He's one of our editorial interns. Nice.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:57.480]   And I gave him a couple paragraphs about the anti-competitive stuff.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:00.480]   So I got a co-buy line kind of as a favor from him helping him out.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:03.480]   So he's going back to school, but he's going to say, "Hey, I got a tech crunch by line."
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   We've got like 45 so far. So it's been pretty nice. Very good.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.480]   That's a good internship.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:10.480]   Oh, do you listen to audiobooks? Anybody?
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.480]   I do. Yes, sir. Yeah.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.480]   Georgia does. Tim does. Chris does. I do.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.480]   Actually, I've been Audible.com.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.480]   You know, we talk about them all the time.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.480]   180,000 audiobooks.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.480]   They are now the largest audiobook store anywhere.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.480]   And it's great. And by the way, this is an Amazon company.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.480]   I wonder if they report their Audible earnings.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:32.480]   They do not. Yeah, they don't break them out, huh?
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.480]   So if you are not yet an Audible member, you've certainly heard us talk about it.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.480]   I'm wondering why.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.480]   I'm thinking some...
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   It's certainly not the selection. I mean, everything comes out on Audible now.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.480]   Best sellers, fiction, but also nonfiction.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.480]   Anything you could conceivably want.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.480]   There's even computer books like programming language books on Audible.com.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:59.480]   And of course, if you're a fan of performers like Aziz and Zari's new book,
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.480]   Modern Romance just came out.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:06.480]   This is a great way to read those celebrity books.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.480]   And often they're read by the author.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.480]   Actually, Amy Pollard, she has pleases.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:13.480]   Not just read by Amy Pollard, but Carol Burnett, Seth Meyers,
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.480]   Eileen and William Pollard, her parents, Patrick Stewart,
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.480]   and Kathleen Turner.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.480]   Did Amy Schumer written a book yet?
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.480]   Because boy, I'd read that.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:25.480]   She's hot, hot, hot.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.480]   Do you have Amy Schumer in Canada?
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:30.480]   I don't know if we have Amy Schumer in Canada.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.480]   No, but I love Amy Schumer.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.480]   I think she's absolutely brilliant and really, really funny.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.480]   I haven't seen Trainwreck yet, but I hear really good things.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.480]   Oh, that's what she was in.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.480]   I'm going from school to that.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.480]   I don't know if I'm going to watch...
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.480]   I don't know if I might, you know, wait.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.480]   I love all her skits. They're so great.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:49.480]   I do what you do, Georgia.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:51.480]   I save movies because if I go see every movie,
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:54.480]   then I won't have anything to watch at home.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:55.480]   At home.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.480]   So I only go to a few movies in the outside world,
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.480]   because I want something to watch at home.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.480]   I'm going to stay in that basement.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.480]   I love my basement.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.480]   It's got the windows window.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.480]   Yeah, we have a little movie room for our basement, and that's...
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.480]   That's another thing I do.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.480]   I absolutely insist on reading the book before I see the movie Gone Girl.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.480]   Would ruin Gone Girl if you saw the movie first, because it's got, you know,
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.480]   it's a surprising book.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.480]   But if you listen to it and then you watch it, it's not so bad.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:24.480]   I think you want the spoiler from the book.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.480]   But then there's the problem with the change of the book, so it doesn't go...
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.480]   They do.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480]   They change.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:29.480]   Yeah, the movies.
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:30.480]   Nothing like the heart on me in the last couple of seasons.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.480]   Because I'm like, that's...
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:32.480]   Oh, Game of Thrones.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.480]   They don't.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.480]   And by the way, you can get Game of Thrones.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.480]   You can get everything on Audible Audible.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.480]   Good segue.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.480]   .com.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:43.480]   They have so many great books to choose from, and I'm going to set it up so you can get two books for free.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.480]   Your first 30 days free.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.480]   You know what you might want to get on Monday on triangulation.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.480]   Ernest Klein is going to join us.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.480]   Do you know who Ernest Klein is?
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.480]   He wrote Ready Player One.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.480]   And by the way, the Audible version read by Will Wheaton is freaking awesome.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:02.480]   His new book just came out about a week ago.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:07.480]   Armada, a novel Will Wheaton re-prezes his performance.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.480]   Let me play a little bit of Armada for you.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.480]   Back outside.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:17.480]   Just in time to see another bright flash of silver as the craft streaked laterally across the landscape,
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:24.480]   then halted and hovered over an adjacent patch of terrain before zooming off again.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.480]   I love Ernest Klein.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.480]   He's going to be a great guest in triangulation.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480]   I will give you an assignment.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:31.480]   Get both his books right now.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.480]   Absolutely free.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.480]   You can listen to them and then watch the interview.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.480]   Can I come back and be on the interview?
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.480]   You know Ernest?
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.480]   No, but it sounds good.
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.480]   Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.480]   Audible.com.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.480]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.480]   You'll be signing up for the platinum plan that's two books a month.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.480]   You get two credits a month.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:52.480]   You also get the daily digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times so you can listen
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.480]   in the car.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.480]   I listen at work.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:55.480]   I listen at play.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:56.480]   I listen in the gym.
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.480]   I listen when I'm walking the dog and doing the dishes.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.480]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.480]   Two books are waiting for you.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.480]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.480]   And the number two.
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.480]   I loved the OnePlus One.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:14.480]   I thought it was the best phone of 2014 Great Battery Life.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.480]   Which by the way, nobody seems to be doing anymore.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.480]   Everybody's just giving up.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.480]   The iPhone has great battery life.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.480]   No Android.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.480]   Yeah, no, iPhone's good.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.480]   But no Android phone has battery life.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.480]   I'm using the Nexus 6.
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.480]   It's like eight hours battery life.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.480]   That's not easy to do.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.480]   Eight hours battery life.
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:30.480]   Yes, it's terrible.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.480]   That's ridiculous.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:33.480]   So, what's so very small.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.480]   Hold it up to Georgia.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.480]   It'll look like it's checked.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.480]   Look at that.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.480]   Look at that.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.480]   It covers us bigger than our head.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.480]   Exactly.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.480]   It's beautiful.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:45.480]   But the OnePlus One had 20, I would get 20 hours battery life.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.480]   Now they offer a very pure lollipop version of lollipop.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.480]   They call their Oxygen OS.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.480]   You can also get signage in mod 12 on it.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.480]   So the OnePlus Two, people have been very interested.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:03.480]   OnePlus has been giving out tips talking about it.
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:06.480]   They say it will be around 450 bucks.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.480]   That's about 100 bucks more than the old phone.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.480]   But still a lot less than a flagship phone from anybody else.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.480]   700 usually, right?
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:15.480]   So still a firm discount.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.480]   Oh, it's a great discount.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.480]   They're also going to include a Type C connector and charger.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:25.480]   That new USB connector that Apple's using on the MacBook and Google's using on the Pixel.
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:27.480]   Google's already said that the future of Android is Type C.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.480]   So that's pretty exciting.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.480]   It's true for everything, right?
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.480]   I think so.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:35.480]   For laptops, for everything, it's going to eliminate these proprietary adapters, which are terrible.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:41.480]   We also think that it's going to have four gigs of RAM, which makes a big difference in Android.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:46.480]   Apple really manages RAM much better, but on Android, more RAM is good.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.480]   And the interesting thing is the launch tomorrow will be in VR.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:53.480]   So they're going to be in what?
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.480]   Virtual reality.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:55.480]   You'll be able to go.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.480]   It's going to be 7 p.m. Pacific on Monday.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:04.480]   And you probably should run out and get cardboard or something, some sort of VR helmet so that you can
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.480]   go online.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:13.480]   They're actually even offering on their cardboard page an opportunity to get cardboard that will work.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.480]   Oh, it's sold out.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.480]   Oh, there you go.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.480]   That's not a surprise at OnePlus.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480]   Pretty much.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.480]   They can't even get enough cardboard.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.480]   That's ridiculous.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.480]   So they say that there is going to be an invitation system again.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:31.480]   In fact, I applied for my invitation immediately, but that they're going to be far more this time.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:34.480]   So maybe they'll be able to get those out to people.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:37.480]   Okay, so it was HTC that would let the Android war.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:40.480]   Then it was Samsung, Xiaomi, and it is one plus next.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:43.480]   I feel like we go through these Android OEMs on a two year basis.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:45.480]   It's really stunning.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.480]   Samsung has just collapsed.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:51.480]   I thought the S6 would revive them, but it is not sold well at all.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.480]   HTC is no longer even in the running.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:00.480]   They've just fumbled the ball, though they have a new HTC phone coming that looks pretty beautiful.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:04.480]   I think OnePlus, I don't know, Xiaomi, you can't get in the US, so.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.480]   Well, you can.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.480]   I mean, we have the office, but you can't buy it in commercial on the device by .tumbler.gift.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.480]   It's never going to be a big seller in the US.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:19.480]   One plus is people who've had hardware issues with the first one plus phone, and I'm hoping that they have a little bit better reliability with this one.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:24.480]   But I know multiple people who've had issues with the display, caulking out or touch sensitivity going bad.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.480]   Absolutely.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.480]   I think that reliability has been a challenge for them.
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.480]   So I'm hoping that they improve that as well.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:33.480]   And more importantly, if you have problems with it, it's very hard to get support.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:39.480]   They haven't done a good job of, if they're a Chinese company, I don't think they have a big support network.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.480]   So that's been a concern too.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.480]   I've heard from a lot of people, as I'm sure you have Tim, who bought one's phones.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.480]   They had a problem and just couldn't get them replaced, couldn't get them fixed.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:52.480]   Any event, it's going to be interesting to watch.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.480]   I'm very intrigued that they're doing a VR announcement from their offices.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.480]   And I hope that the phone is available soon.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:04.480]   They haven't said exactly when the phone will be available.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.480]   But do go and...
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.480]   Do we also have the replaceable backings?
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.480]   Yes, I think they're going to do that again.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.480]   The backing is that same weird pebbled plastic.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.480]   Do we like that or is that kind of ugly?
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.480]   It does.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.480]   But you know who cares because nobody, everybody puts their phone in a case, right?
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.480]   Did you cut yourself?
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.480]   I'm waiting on set, sorry.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.480]   Oh my goodness.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.480]   See, my scab broke up and some bandit-y and...
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:30.480]   Well, we're giving you a... what is that? A Marvel Bandit, so...
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.480]   I was trying to do quietly off-camera-dramatic.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.480]   You know, you know...
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.480]   Hey, I see everything. I see everything.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.480]   I also see that you now have 38 favorites and nine retweets on your stolen joke.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.480]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:45.480]   How long before the season this season comes?
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.480]   What's the total count now and now that I'm done bleeding?
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:50.480]   The count is 6 and 39, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480]   Wow, it's impressive.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:54.480]   Proves the point though that I could get up if you were stolen twice before you wake up.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480]   Yep.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.480]   All right.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:57.480]   I'm done.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.480]   Not the fastest processor. It's only a Snapdragon 801.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.480]   801, is that right?
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.480]   Oh, that's the OnePlus One. Never mind, I'm sorry.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.480]   Well, you have better information.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.480]   Well, I'm looking at the OnePlus One.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.480]   I went to the OnePlus site, but the only information they have here...
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:13.480]   So, is the OnePlus One a 2 or is the OnePlus Two a 3?
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.480]   Huh?
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.480]   The name is killing me.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.480]   OnePlus One.
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.480]   OnePlus Two...
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.480]   Which would be a 3.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.480]   Right?
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:22.480]   Out of 10?
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.480]   I'm out of three.
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.480]   3 out of 3.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.480]   I guess that's a 2 because there's two phones now, so...
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.480]   If you want to get an invite, you can get one at OnePlus.net.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:37.480]   When I signed up for an invite, I was 39,152.
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:41.480]   I imagine a few more people have signed up for invites.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:45.480]   Do you have your little virtual reality glasses though?
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:46.480]   Oh, I do.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.480]   I have cardboard, but I also have...
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:54.480]   I'm sorry to say, I'm almost embarrassed to say, the Galaxy S6 and the Gear VR helmet,
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:56.480]   the Galaxy cells that you put these...
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:58.480]   I have Gear VR as well, Leo.
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:00.480]   So, we can commiserate together.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:02.480]   It's a lot of money.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.480]   And you know, it's really pathetic.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:10.480]   The S6 overheat so easily, that almost always halfway through the VR experience, it goes,
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.480]   we're pausing while we cool down.
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.480]   Yeah, same thing on the look-
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.480]   It's a little bit more.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.480]   Oh, look, we have one.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.480]   It's over each other too.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.480]   Is that it?
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.480]   This is a cheap one.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.480]   Ah!
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.480]   But this is cardboard, right?
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.480]   This is not...
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.480]   Wow!
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.480]   Even dorkier somehow.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.480]   You can look like the cool kids.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.480]   We should have a viewing party on Monday night.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480]   For the...
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.480]   You want to come over?
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480]   No!
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:34.480]   You can like...
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.480]   I came on camera, I ran out of tequila, and my arms are debleed.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.480]   No!
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:40.480]   I'm done with twins.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.480]   No, I'm done with twins.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.480]   One episode.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:46.480]   Have you done any VR stuff, George, at all?
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:49.480]   That's such a hard fish.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:53.480]   So, I've been dying to try out Oculus Rift and went to CES.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:59.480]   I had my date planned because I'm really into the virtual reality type of thing, especially
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.480]   for gaming and just experiential kind of things.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.480]   And the day that I left, Serenity and Renee got to go in my place and then, you know,
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:09.480]   bragged about it the entire time to me.
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:15.480]   So, I have never actually used Oculus or, you know, HoloLens or anything else as of yet.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.480]   You can get...
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:22.480]   I mean, that is Oculus, the VR, Samsung Gear VR plus Gear S6 or a Note 4.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:24.480]   That is Oculus, right, Tim?
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:25.480]   That's the same technology.
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.480]   Using Oculus technology, yeah.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.480]   Definitely not quite the same experience.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:31.480]   There are issues with fogging and things like that that you don't necessarily get with...
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:32.480]   Fog!
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:34.480]   I have that problem, especially when I watch VR porn.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.480]   It gets all stained up.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.480]   Well, that's your shower?
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:40.480]   No, I shouldn't be watching the showers.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.480]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480]   I'm saying if you're going to...
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.480]   Well, no, you shouldn't.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.480]   Definitely not.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:45.480]   No electronics in the shower to standard...
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:46.480]   I can't think of it.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.480]   Tim, I'm glad you said that because it does.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.480]   It steams up for me.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.480]   Yeah, it's definitely an issue.
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.480]   Maybe you should watch the documentaries or some audio books on your Oculus instead of watching
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.480]   porn.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.480]   I do it for research.
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.480]   Actually, that's for the articles.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:04.480]   I do it for research because a couple of the big porn sites have started shipping virtual
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.480]   reality porn for these devices.
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:08.480]   All right.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.480]   So, who here's use HoloLens?
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.480]   Okay.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.480]   Just how do you like that?
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:13.480]   That's the micro-sus solution.
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:14.480]   Yeah, that's only I really use.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.480]   It's not in cardboard.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.480]   But that's augmented, not virtual.
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:20.480]   Certainly there, but I mean like tomato, tomato, potato, you know.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.480]   Well, there is a difference.
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:23.480]   You can see the world around you with the...
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.480]   What do you prefer?
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.480]   VR or AR?
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.480]   Well, okay.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:31.480]   So, this is a big change because for a long time I said forget VR, it makes people nauseous.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:33.480]   It's really only for gaming.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.480]   You can't see what's going on.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.480]   People could sneak up behind you and cost you on the head.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.480]   Yes.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.480]   But AR, you see what's going on.
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:41.480]   It doesn't make you nauseous.
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:44.480]   And the use case is amazing.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.480]   Now, it's not great for gaming, although Minecraft looks pretty cool.
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:48.480]   Indeed.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:50.480]   But it's not really for immersive gaming.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:53.480]   It's kind of a new user interface imposed on the world.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.480]   And I thought that was...
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.480]   I was very excited until I kind of spent a little more time with the Gear VR.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:00.480]   And now I'm kind of more...
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.480]   I'm sold on both.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.480]   I think both technologies are very exciting.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.480]   Different use cases.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.480]   But both very exciting.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:07.480]   I think it's very, very true.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:11.400]   But, Tim, if you depict right now, or Georgia, either one really, between VR and AR for the next
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.400]   five years, pick one or the two varietals, what would you pick?
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.400]   VR right now.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:17.400]   I think in five years, AR could be cool.
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:21.400]   But in the intervening years, AR is probably going to be rather challenged.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.400]   VR is in a much better state right now than AR is going to be.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:27.400]   So if I had to choose between the two, definitely, I think VR will be much more cool for the next couple of years.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.400]   Georgia?
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:31.400]   I'm also most interested in VR right now.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:32.400]   I saw the HoloLens.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:34.400]   And I'm not as interested in that.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.400]   And in the end, I'm just waiting for a holodeck.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.400]   So...
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.400]   I'll take that.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.640]   What I'm so
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.400]   interested in is the way that VR is going to be.
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.400]   And I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.400]   But I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.400]   But I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:01.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.400]   I think VR is going to be a little bit more fun.
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.400]   But I think VR will get their first AR second because it's more difficult for them to do.
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400]   Maybe.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:11.400]   Those things onto the actual world.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.400]   And we've known that because Microsoft is having trouble with HoloLens.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.400]   They've really constrained the view area to a tiny little.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.400]   Give it three generations.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.400]   I mean, the Apple Watch, we'll get better over time.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.400]   And so I feel like this technology and its infancy is still so interesting.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:29.400]   By the time it's version three, it's going to be downright compelling.
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.400]   Accidentally calling somebody.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:37.400]   Or butt dialing as the kids know it.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.400]   As we said.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.400]   It is now your fault.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:45.400]   A federal appeals court in Cincinnati has ruled that somebody who accidentally calls somebody
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.400]   else is not protected by a right to privacy.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:54.400]   So in other words, you know, when, okay, Georgia, again, you're my guinea pig.
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.400]   Because I admitted to the fact that when I walked by a lit window at night, I look in.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.400]   If somebody but dials you, do you listen?
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:03.400]   I would listen.
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.400]   I would be wondering is someone in trouble?
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.400]   What is happening?
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.400]   Oh, yeah, right.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.400]   What's that muffled sound?
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.400]   And it would just be interesting to see what are they?
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.400]   What do they really think about you?
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.400]   That's what I'm waiting for.
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.400]   I'm waiting for this.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.400]   You know, Elio of heart is such a jerk.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:20.400]   What is he doing?
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:21.400]   People already said that.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.400]   I think that most people would though.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.400]   I think most people wouldn't hang up.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.400]   At least they would, you know, wait if I hear someone rambling on in a conversation.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:31.400]   I will get bored and hang up.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.400]   But I would be a little bit interested to listen in for Beth.
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:35.400]   Here's the backstory.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:40.400]   Two members of the board of the Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport were
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:44.400]   in Bologna, Italy, October 2013.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:50.400]   One of them called Carol, who was an assistant to the chief executive of the airport, to
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.400]   ask her to book a dinner reservation for them.
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:57.400]   So they're calling Kentucky from Bologna, Italy saying, "Can you make a dinner reservation
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.400]   for me in Italy?"
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:05.400]   After the call, the James Huff, the chairman of the board, put the cell phone in his
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:11.400]   suit pocket and it but dialed the assistant's office number.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.400]   She said, "Hello?
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.400]   Hello?
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:21.400]   The directors didn't hear her and continued talking about replacing her boss."
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:23.400]   For 91 minutes.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400]   For 91 minutes.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.400]   That's a long phone call.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:30.400]   That's an expensive phone call from Bologna, Italy.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:35.400]   She, as the assistant, put the phone on speaker and took notes.
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.400]   But she just moved a pencil and paper and wore a tell-a-tide.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.400]   What was the media here?
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.400]   Well eventually she whipped out her iPhone and started recording.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:49.400]   Toward the end of the call, Huff returned to his hotel room, recapped the conversation about
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:56.400]   hiring the CEO with his wife so that she had a second chance to write everything down.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:03.400]   She got the audio, the assistant got the audio file professionally enhanced, typed up her
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:08.400]   notes and gave copies of it to members, other members of the board.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:14.400]   Now the husband and wife then sued saying, "You violated federal wiretap law.
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.400]   It's illegal to intercept electronic oral communications intentionally.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:22.400]   The original court ruled for the assistant.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:24.400]   The Huff's appealed.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.400]   The appellate judge judged Danny Boggs.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.400]   And if I ever have to go before a judge, I want it to be judged Danny Boggs.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:35.400]   Danny, Danny, you're a part of the boggs.
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:36.400]   Hey, hey, hey, what is this?
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.400]   Jersey, get it up yet.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:46.400]   Judge Danny Boggs says, "But dialing is kind of like accidentally leaving your window uncovered.
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:48.400]   Get this Georgia.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:52.400]   You are not legally protected from people looking into your house."
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.400]   Um, okay.
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:57.400]   If you don't close the curtains and ain't your fault.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:01.400]   Leaving the curtains open is a conscious choice.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:07.400]   Um, sorry, if I butt dialed you on the way home today from Petaluma or the hell we are,
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:08.400]   would you listen?
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:09.400]   No, actually I don't.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.400]   You know why it's boring.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:40.400]   It's like, "Poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, p
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:47.400]   Yeah, it makes you self conscious.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:48.400]   You read the chat?
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.400]   I read and I reply to it when I can.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.400]   Wow.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:52.400]   I try to.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.400]   Some of our hosts do and some of them don't.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.400]   I usually cancel people not to pay attention.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:59.400]   I on the other hand do read it because I get a secret little thrill when I see them say
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.400]   bad things about other people.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.400]   So that's just me.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:09.400]   Uh, by the way, the judge provided a link to a article, "Prevent Unwanted Butt Dialing"
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.400]   with smart pocket guy guard.
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:14.400]   Smart, there we go.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:20.400]   An app that he says the defendant should have downloaded.
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:26.400]   So, um, that is the most amazingly egregious case of spying on somebody I've ever heard
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.400]   of.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.400]   Well, the best part, she wasn't trying to be bad.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:29.400]   She was trying to be useful.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:30.400]   She was being a good employee.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:31.400]   Yeah, I mean, I don't have an impression of a judge.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:32.400]   She was very efficient.
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:33.400]   She deserves a raise.
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:34.400]   I'd like an assistant like that.
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:35.400]   Um, no.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:36.400]   No.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.400]   No.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.400]   I'm the one who would be talking about firing somebody.
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:40.400]   That Alex Willham.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:41.400]   Never have him on again.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.400]   That guy's on point.
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:45.400]   I'm not a parlor.
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:46.400]   No, I think you're great.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.400]   Are we loving Pluto?
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.400]   We're loving Pluto.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.400]   More now, a color enhanced image of Pluto that makes it look kind of-
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:54.400]   That's kind of-
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.400]   Yeah, it looks like one of those paperweights you buy in the, uh, airy fairy store.
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:03.400]   You know, they should engrave like hope into it.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.400]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:07.400]   Georgia, you must have a few of those.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.400]   No.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:09.400]   No, I don't.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.400]   I don't have it.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.400]   I'm thinking I'm finding it.
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:13.400]   You, you, my friends, are a roger's dog.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:18.400]   I thought that you would be the type of person I'm just saying that would have little semi-polished
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:21.400]   stones with little affirmations on them, you know, persevere.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:23.400]   I don't even have them in my office.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:24.400]   I don't have any of them.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:25.400]   No.
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:26.400]   Okay.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.400]   You know, hope is what you, you know, do when everyone else talks doing it.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.400]   I don't do that.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.400]   I-
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:34.400]   My office is pretty just straightforward Zen.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:35.400]   Wow.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:36.400]   It's kind of like your backdrop.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:37.400]   Don't do that.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.400]   It doesn't just look like though that that that that's those are those.
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.400]   It's got a little heart on it.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:43.400]   It's a beautiful image.
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:44.400]   It's a gorgeous image.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.400]   Yeah, it is.
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:48.400]   Would it treat to be alive when we finally have this image in our lives?
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.400]   You know, because 50 years ago, if you die, you've never seen-
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.400]   Never seen Pluto.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.400]   But I mean, let alone a butt dial.
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:57.400]   Well, you, you, you butt dial Pluto and it costs a lot in long distance.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:59.400]   Um, this is such a gorgeous image.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:00.400]   I'm so impressed by it.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.400]   And it's fun to see technology actually still progressing and bringing us new things that
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.840]   are not just photo apps, you know, or do we get food?
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:07.400]   You know, in a way, you're right, isn't it?
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.400]   This gives us some hope for humanity.
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.800]   This took a lot of money effort.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:11.800]   Ten years.
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:13.400]   Yeah, ten year.
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:14.400]   Love it.
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:18.800]   And it's so much rounder than you would expect something to be from the Kuiper belt.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.760]   You would have expected to be a little bit more rocky.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:24.400]   I'm like very impressed with how beautiful Pluto really is.
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.400]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:26.400]   Georgia, I'm done.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.400]   The Kuiper belt is the asteroid belt on the outside of the solar system.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.400]   Right.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.400]   Okay, then you start to make sure-
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:32.400]   Right.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400]   And that's what they're going to do is from.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:38.200]   So that's why they don't believe it's actually a planet for say, don't send me angry tweets.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:39.760]   How do we know this all planet?
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.400]   Sorry, how do we know this from the belt?
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.400]   No, we know that's where the Kuiper belt is.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.400]   Okay.
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.000]   And the belt is, it's just a belt of debris that is rotating around the outside of the
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000]   solar system.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000]   Yes.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000]   Yes.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000]   And there's other-
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]   But you're right.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.400]   Other planet like objects like Pluto that are there.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.400]   So- Look at the comet, right?
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.000]   We've been, we just recently landed on this.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.200]   It's all irregular and weird.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:01.240]   This thing is, it looks like a marble.
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:02.240]   It's a perfect-
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:03.240]   It's-
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:08.800]   The other thing, we talked to somebody on the team, the New Horizons team, a couple of
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:10.480]   weeks ago on the new screensavers.
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:11.920]   And I asked her, "Why are there more craters?"
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:13.480]   You know, the moon is like, "Pockmark."
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:14.480]   Absolutely.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.200]   She said, "It's not that it's not getting hit by stuff, but it's active.
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.000]   It's tectonically active."
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.320]   So the craters are getting, you know, covered over.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.320]   So I think that's kind of interesting.
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:28.400]   Yeah, and it actually has an atmosphere.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:29.400]   And water!
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:30.880]   It has water.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:31.880]   Water!
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:32.880]   It's like SF.
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:33.880]   What?
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:37.720]   It's not water though, it's liquid, it's liquid nitrogen, I believe.
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:39.360]   Oh, water, liquid nitrogen.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.360]   What's the difference?
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:43.960]   You can drink both if you want to die.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:46.400]   I thought they found water, H2O.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:49.280]   The mountains are made of water, says John.
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.960]   He's our amateur astronomer here.
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:54.880]   AT&T and DirectTV have merged.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:57.400]   Alex Wilhelm has a story along with his intern.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:00.840]   Yeah, well, essentially, I mean, this deal is going to happen.
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:01.840]   48 and a half billion dollars.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:02.840]   How about the movie?
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:03.840]   It's a movie, my intern.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.720]   Or our intern, I guess, that I hang out with.
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:11.440]   The real story is after the FCC killed the Comcast deal, essentially, the list one goes
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.440]   through.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:18.080]   So it proves that big combinations on the telco and cable side are not impossible.
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:20.960]   DirectTV is kind of a weakling, though, isn't it?
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.480]   Let's wind there a lot to buy it.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.640]   If you combine the two biggest players as they return to the Comcast, you can't do that.
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:26.640]   It's too anti-competitive.
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.480]   In this case, they're going to let it go through.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:32.720]   The dollar amounts eye-popping, but I mean, in the air room, which large checkers have
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.280]   tens of billions in cash on hand, it's not that terrifying.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.280]   And I think it's a fair deal.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.640]   I'm not that opposed to it.
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:45.040]   It does make AT&T the largest pay TV company in the world 26 million subscribers.
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.680]   That's bigger than Comcast?
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:48.600]   I don't have the Congress to offer off company.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:49.600]   This is not right.
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:50.600]   But I think this combination is.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.600]   I think Congress is 23.5 million.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.600]   So it's close.
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:54.600]   It's close.
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:56.600]   It's close to us in 23.3 million broadband.
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:57.600]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.200]   More broadband subs than cable subs.
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.200]   I'm not surprised.
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:01.200]   Are you surprised by that?
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.200]   I'm very surprised.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.200]   Why?
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:06.440]   Because Comcast really incents you to get both.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:07.440]   No.
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.080]   And they even charge you more if you get internet without TV.
[01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:12.440]   They charge you 10 bucks more.
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:13.440]   Yep.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:16.480]   So it seems like most people just say, "All right, I'll throw in the TV."
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:19.880]   Yeah, but then the special deal ends and you pay for it for your afterwards.
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:21.880]   We're excited for three years, by the way.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:22.880]   It's smart enough to do that.
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:23.880]   I'm dumb.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:26.920]   I feel like broadband now has to place a TV for so many people that it's not a shocking
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:27.920]   stat to me.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.400]   It's a long time coming.
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:31.640]   And so it'll only grow to the discrepancy moving forward.
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:34.040]   26 million is, of course, a lot smaller than Comcast.
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:36.080]   Time Warner would have been a head of that merger.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:37.080]   Absolutely.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:38.080]   But not through.
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:40.120]   FCC also made some stipulations.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:44.120]   They required the combined entity to deploy.
[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:45.120]   This is good for us.
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:50.960]   High speed, fiber optic broadband internet to 12.5 million customer locations, as well
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:54.560]   as e-rate eligible schools and libraries.
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:58.040]   They have to obey net neutrality provisions.
[01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:02.800]   So they're not going to get to squeeze small video providers as a result of this merger.
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:06.200]   And importantly, on the peering side of things, they have to submit those agreements to the
[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:07.200]   FCC for you.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:08.200]   Love that.
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:09.200]   Exactly.
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.000]   So they can't go to level three and say, "Hey, level three, if Netflix, or go to Netflix,
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.560]   and say, "Hey, if you want to get access to our customers, you're going to have to give
[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:16.560]   us a little extra money."
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:18.720]   Again, it would be a shame if you're broadband TV.
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:21.280]   It would be a terrible shame.
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.280]   Sure.
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:24.280]   I think yours would think.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:25.280]   All right.
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:29.200]   China's made a major cultural step forward.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:32.560]   They are eliminating the ban on video game consoles.
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:37.200]   Commodore has announced they're going to start shipping the Amiga immediately.
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.200]   No.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.200]   It's coming out next week for $5.99.
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:41.200]   Yeah.
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:44.960]   I didn't know they banned the Xbox, the band PlayStation.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.440]   It's kind of been a soft band.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:48.640]   You could actually get the Xbox One there.
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:50.440]   And there have been some consoles made available.
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.800]   But it's kind of been a gradual thing.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.600]   For a long time, there were no video game consoles available legally and officially
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:00.360]   you had to go kind of through the black market to get them.
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:01.360]   Wow.
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:02.680]   But this is a good place.
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:06.640]   Well, because they're horrible for you.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:07.800]   But this would be so cigarettes.
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:08.800]   I know.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:09.800]   They love them.
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:11.440]   But this would be a really interesting test case.
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.520]   George, I want you to get on this to see if violence increases in China as a result of
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.920]   violent video games.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:22.960]   I think that we've already, you know, disclaimed that it does desensitize you.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:25.360]   But it's not going to make you more violent, right?
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.400]   Neither will a jelly donuts.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:27.640]   So we're all good.
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:32.560]   I am violent if I don't get a jelly donut.
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:34.360]   That's what I get.
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:37.760]   All right.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:38.760]   And one last story.
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:44.680]   Verizon's new video service because Verizon has also been in acquisition mode and is growing.
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:46.520]   And they have a new video service.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:48.400]   What do you think that name is?
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:52.000]   Well, as a current Verizon employee, that's what they bought.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000]   Oh, that's right.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000]   You worked for him.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000]   So this is even more fun.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000]   I'm so sorry.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000]   That logo is crap.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000]   It's Logan is lame.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000]   And I hate its color scheme and Verizon bite me.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.600]   It's so it's good.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:02.600]   You're proving you're right.
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:03.600]   It's really independence.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:04.600]   How's it all?
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.200]   Much as the Gawker team did when they lost.
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:07.200]   No, that's true.
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:08.400]   Again, you have no Gawker on the show.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.400]   No Gawker.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:11.080]   So it is mint green.
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:14.520]   It looks like, God, I don't even know what.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:19.200]   It's a kind of a question mark or question mark followed by a circle with a 90 and go
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:20.680]   90 is the name of it.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:22.240]   What millennial is to blame for this?
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:23.920]   Do you think it's a millennial?
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:24.920]   Absolutely.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:25.920]   Oh, people actually have taste.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:26.920]   Aren't you a millennial?
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:27.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:28.920]   I don't like my team either.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.920]   You don't like your team, huh?
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:35.160]   Go 90.
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:41.760]   It is going to be free at least to start and will include ESPN via comm CBS Sports, the
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:43.560]   NFL and DreamWorks.
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:45.880]   Free to watch it launch.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:49.000]   That means like a minute later, we'll start charging you.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.760]   Tim, are you going to use this?
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:56.440]   No, and I am no longer a Verizon employee or I never was officially Verizon employee.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:59.240]   I guess I should say, but no, I will not use this.
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:00.240]   What do you watch for TV?
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:01.720]   Because you're in the middle of nowhere, right?
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:04.600]   In fact, you use a MyFi, I think, to talk to us.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:08.400]   We now have time warrant cable and we pay them to run a long cable up the driveway and
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:10.400]   we are now truly tethered.
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.600]   But I don't really watch TV.
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:16.720]   We only have internet, I watch Netflix and so I'm usually a season behind whatever the
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.520]   new thing is.
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:20.560]   I just read an interesting article about Netflix.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:24.520]   I guess the DVD by mail business is shrunk hugely.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.840]   Yeah, but it's still the $90 million in net profits in the last quarter.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:31.480]   So it's kind of like AOL's old dial-up business.
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:34.040]   A declining cash flow, but still a cash cow.
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:38.160]   But really a good example of what I think I have such respect for Reed Hastings, the
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.160]   CEO.
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:40.160]   Absolutely.
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:44.520]   I think it's a very difficult pivot made more difficult by some missteps saying he was
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.760]   going to merge the two companies.
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:49.760]   Then we was going to separate and it was going to charge you twice as much.
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:53.600]   But one of the things, this is the New York Times writing about it, one of the things
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:58.120]   they've done right, they've fallen in 2010, they were doing 20 million subscribers to
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:03:59.120]   DVD's service.
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:04.920]   Now it's 5.3 million, but the way they've made that work for them and continue to be
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.880]   profitable is by automation.
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:07.880]   Yes.
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:09.640]   It's a giant robot.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:12.280]   Now I just like saying the words giant robot.
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:16.640]   They used to have humans empty the envelopes, stuff the envelopes.
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:23.200]   Now they have a giant robot which opens the envelope, cleans the disc inside, identifies
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:29.440]   it, checks that it works, puts it back in the sleeve and then back on the shelf, 3400
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:34.120]   discs an hour, which is a 500% increase over humans.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:37.600]   So think about how much better their margins are on digital distribution as opposed to
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.360]   actual physical distribution.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.960]   So as this declines to be moved from DVD's to actually streaming service, they make more
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:43.960]   money.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:49.800]   Yeah, because they have 5.3 million DVD users, 65 million streaming members.
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.800]   Exactly.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:51.800]   That's a huge difference.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:54.240]   And yet they have no good movies in streaming.
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:56.920]   I guess people don't care what they watch, right?
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:59.120]   They have a good comedy selection, look at them that.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:02.280]   Well they have a game of, they have house of cards.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.160]   I mean they have the originals on Netflix are quite good.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:06.840]   Maybe that's what's saving them.
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:09.400]   Well the days of Redbox are behind us.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.560]   I think it's the fair thing to say.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:11.560]   Redbox.
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:12.560]   It's still around, isn't it?
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:13.560]   Well I got a DVD to the office.
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:17.200]   It was a Bitcoin documentary and they handed it to me and they sent me one too.
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:18.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:19.200]   But I couldn't play it.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.200]   I didn't have a CD player in the office.
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:21.200]   DVD.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:22.200]   DVD player, whatever.
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:24.000]   I literally didn't have one computer that I should play the game.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000]   No neither.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.440]   Why would they just send me a USB drive?
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:27.440]   Send me a link.
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:30.120]   Send me a link.
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:34.520]   Tim Stevens, he is at CNET, that's where he covers autos and anything else he's interested
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:35.520]   in.
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.800]   It's always great to have you on Tim @Tim_Stevens on Twitter if you want to steal any of Alex's
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:40.800]   jokes, be my guest.
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:44.200]   I'm going to retweet that right now I think.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:47.680]   Yeah, let's all do that, right?
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:53.480]   We also have had a lovely time with the Tang and Tequila Drinking Alex Wilhelm.
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:55.640]   I'll get you a Tang for next time.
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:56.640]   Okay.
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:57.640]   Can I come back?
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:59.280]   Yeah of course you can come back.
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:00.280]   You're a character.
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:01.280]   All right.
[02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:02.280]   Yeah.
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:03.280]   All right.
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:07.080]   And of course, Georgia Dow is always coming back because she's the greatest at imore.com.
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:10.240]   She's at Georgia_Dow.
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:14.560]   You should have gone to Mexico last time Alex was there and bought Georgia.
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:15.560]   You could have bought you.
[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:16.560]   He bought Alex.
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.560]   I bought it over Skype.
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:18.560]   Oh, you didn't go to Mexico?
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.920]   I just lived there, but it's a different story.
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:23.200]   And so some guy named Alex just said, "Hey, you want Alex?"
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.200]   No, I tweeted him.
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:25.200]   I'm like, "Hey, man, can I buy your username?"
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.200]   And he said, "Yes?"
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:27.680]   Well, Twitter used to break every day back then.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.680]   How much did you pay?
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:29.680]   60.
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:30.680]   60 bucks?
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:31.680]   Yeah.
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:32.680]   That's amazing.
[02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:33.920]   It was seven years ago.
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:35.880]   How much would you pay for @Georgia?
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:37.120]   Wouldn't you love that?
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.760]   I would say $200.
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:39.760]   Yeah.
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:40.760]   That's about it.
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:44.320]   So the state of Georgia, if you don't need that Twitter handle anymore.
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:46.440]   Yeah, get rid of it.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.640]   Give it on to somebody nice from Canada.
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:49.640]   Thank you, Georgia Dow, for being here.
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:50.640]   You can use $200.
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:51.640]   Hey, you know what I didn't do?
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:54.880]   I didn't show you the wonderful things we did this week on Twitter.
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:58.880]   How about a little bit of a little edited mini clip fest?
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:03.040]   If you didn't see the shows on Twitter this week, this is what you missed.
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.520]   Previously on Twitter.
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:06.680]   Security now.
[02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:12.760]   What these guys found is a way to connect to Chrysler vulnerable vehicles.
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:15.000]   They completely took over his instrumentation.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000]   Oh, it's horrific.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.720]   They can kill the engine, cut the transmission, disengage the brakes.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:24.400]   Meanwhile, those guys were at home on the couch doing this over the internet.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.920]   This was really scary to me.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:28.240]   All about Android.
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:33.720]   How do we feel about the remix mini Kickstarter, which offers a PC running Android for just
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:34.720]   $20?
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:41.160]   I would rather take a $20 bill, fold it up, stick it in the HDMI port or whatever this
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:45.840]   thing plugs in because a month later, when I quit using this, I'll be able to pull that
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:49.480]   $20 bill back out and actually do something useful.
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:50.960]   The new screen savers.
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:57.640]   The article about the Cascadia subduction zone scared a lot of people.
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:59.080]   We thought we'd get an expert in here.
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:02.880]   Any earthquake on Cascadia doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be the whole thing.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:06.680]   Whenever there's an earthquake and then some article gets into like, you're all going to
[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:10.640]   die and the community, the earth science community is just like no.
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:13.080]   To it, it's what's for dinner.
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:18.640]   You know, when I'm not pillaging and destroying the coast of Scotland, I enjoy a good day
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:21.640]   with a lot of people.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:23.440]   Don't ask.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:24.640]   Just don't ask.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.160]   Do we have the week ahead?
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:31.280]   Coming up this week, OnePlus is announcing their OnePlus 2 phone tomorrow.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:34.280]   The launch will be streamed in virtual reality.
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:38.720]   Speaking of VR, Nokia will unveil tomorrow what is expected to be a virtual reality product
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.720]   of some kind.
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:44.880]   Then on Tuesday, Motorola will announce the third generation Moto X, a few other things.
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:48.160]   Also on Tuesday, Twitter and Yelp, report earnings.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:49.600]   Moto X ships Wednesday.
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:54.760]   That's also when Google switches users from Google+ photos to Google photos and Google
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:58.760]   plans to announce a mysterious service called Pay With a Photo.
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:01.960]   Facebook and Nintendo announce earnings Wednesday as well.
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:04.000]   But Thursday is the biggest day for earnings.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:10.160]   We'll hear from T-Mobile, Nokia, Sony, Electronic Arts, Shopify, LinkedIn and Samsung.
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.560]   Then on Saturday, the Black Hat conference begins in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:15.840]   That's what's coming up this week.
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:16.840]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:17.840]   Thank you, Mr. Michael.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:21.640]   Elgin, he's our news director and the host of TNT Monday through Friday, your daily dose
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:26.360]   of tech news at 10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern times 1700 UTC.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:28.920]   We do tweet every Sunday afternoon, 3pm Pacific.
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:30.080]   Please stop by and say hi.
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.680]   That's 6pm Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:33.680]   You can watch live.
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.680]   You can be in the chatroom.
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:40.240]   If you're in the Petaluma area, you can also sit in a nice comfortable chair and enjoy
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:41.240]   our cupcakes.
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:44.720]   All you got to do is email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:46.640]   We do put a cupcake out for you.
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:48.960]   They're really good cookies too.
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:49.960]   I recommend it.
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.600]   We have a little logo on top.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:56.520]   Actually, there to celebrate our fourth anniversary, we moved into this studio four years ago
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:57.520]   on Friday on the 24th.
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:59.280]   And you're still in business.
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:00.280]   Still in business.
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:01.280]   It's a miracle, really.
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:03.760]   Oh, it's more than a miracle, my friend.
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.400]   It is, yes, I had to bribe many, many people to do that.
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:14.040]   By the way, Renee Ritchie has tweeted me Georgia and says, "You send him plain text
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:16.560]   files in DocEx over email.
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:18.600]   You are trolling him."
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:25.040]   So busted, busted, just telling you, nothing gets by Twitter.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:30.400]   And thanks to Ted Kecatus who tells us that Friday is Sisadminde.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:31.400]   There we go.
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:33.560]   So get a cupcake for your Sisadminde.
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:35.240]   Oh, look, there's a Sisadmind right there.
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:36.240]   Oh, he's in a shirt.
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:37.240]   Trust me.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:38.240]   Trust me.
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:39.240]   Trust me.
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:40.240]   I read your email.
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:41.240]   You're right.
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:42.240]   I've read it on the phone.
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.840]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:49.840]   Join us next week.
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:50.840]   We'll see you next time.
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:55.000]   And don't forget, we're going to have Ernest Clon in triangulation tomorrow, 11 AM Pacific.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.280]   2PM Eastern Time, 1800 UTC, Twit.TV.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.280]   See you later.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:01.280]   Another Twit.
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:02.280]   He's in the cave.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:03.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:04.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:05.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:06.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:07.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:08.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:09.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:10.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:11.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.280]   Do it the twit baby.
