[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640]   I saw it, so now I can't think of it.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.640]   Yeah, no, I can't.

[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.120]   And of course, Roger and Tom do a show called...
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120]   East Meets West.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   East Meets West.

[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   And Roger plays East and you play West.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.680]   Or I play East because I'm from out East and Roger plays West because he's from California.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   He's from Modesto.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   We can switch it up.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.080]   I see him from San Francisco, but I live in Modesto for 17 years.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.560]   So we want to welcome that show to the Twit Network.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.000]   You're going to start producing that live on Twit right after...
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.520]   On the network right after this weekend tech.

[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   We got such good feedback when I did it that we did it on.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You did it already once.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.600]   We thought, "Hey, let's make a regular thing of this."
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   That's a great idea.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   I'm so glad.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.120]   Thank you for letting us broadcast it.

[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.480]   I'd eventually like to get to something on the network live all the time.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.840]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.240]   Have you thought of sitting up a bird feeder?
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.040]   You know, it's depressing.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.080]   It's really depressing if you go to Ustream.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.320]   We're on Ustream.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   Many, many streams.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.920]   Many millions of people have watched us in Ustream.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.920]   But the Shaboomie puppies beat us.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.920]   I don't even know what they are.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.920]   You need puppies.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   I need puppies.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   You need puppies surrounding you.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.920]   Puppy video.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.320]   John, how you been these days?
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   Everything going well?
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   I'm keeping busy.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   The weather's been fantastic.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   It's been nice and hot.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.680]   Except till today.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.320]   And I don't know.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   What else?
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   That's it.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   I just ask him.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   I didn't really want to know.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   I know you don't.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   Go to channel.org.com.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.120]   And as you continue to show, I'll go slam the phone off.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.440]   Okay.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.240]   I'll get the phone off while we talk about, I guess we should start with Snow Leopard.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.360]   Big release of a new operating system.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.720]   I'm liking to call it Snow Job because I have to say it doesn't feel like the release
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.600]   of a brand new operating system at all.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.880]   It doesn't even really feel like an update.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.880]   But I mean...
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.880]   It doesn't.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.800]   They say it's all under the hood.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.600]   So is the Emperor's new clothes?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.280]   I noticed initially when I started up it did like peg my activity meter like 75% for
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.480]   like 30 seconds for some reason.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.080]   But it settled down.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.400]   So it runs just like it did before I installed it.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.600]   So here's my favorite Easter egg.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.760]   And I guess it is documented.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.920]   But if you hold, when you boot into Snow Leopard, if you hold the 6 and the 4 key, it will boot
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920]   into 64-bit mode.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.600]   Not on my machine.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   Because you have an old machine.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   Yes.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.720]   You know, there's actually like a set list of 5 machines that will boot into 64-bit mode.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.560]   And it's the most ridiculous thing ever.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.160]   First, it was because people might be running a core duo instead of a core 2 duo.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.680]   So you had no 64-bit registers.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.480]   And then it was down to the 32-bit EFI.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.320]   So it might be a setting instead of an Easter egg.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.920]   Like I would like to run in 64-bit.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.000]   This 64-bit OS by default boots in the 32-bit.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.280]   Which really underscores the point that 64-bit is silly anyway.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   Nobody really needs it.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.840]   If you want more than 4 gigs of RAM, that's about it, right?
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.840]   Pretty much.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.880]   I mean, you know, my MacBook is saddled with the old Intel chips that I think the 945
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.000]   that does not allow the machine to see anything past 3 gigs because of the manual control.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Anyway, anyway.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.520]   So yeah, so I have 4 gigs installed.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.880]   OS X says I have 4 gigs.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.440]   If I go to the activity meter, the RAM usage only stops that at 3 gigs.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.960]   It's, I don't know, 30 bucks went to Apple.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.040]   Yeah, I mean, it's 30 boxes.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.520]   If they had charged 129, I could see people would be really upset.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.880]   It's the price of 6 pints again, it's roughly.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   Wouldn't you rather?
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.880]   When you put it that way, it seems a little expensive.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.880]   Seems a lot.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.440]   Oh, pricey.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.440]   One evening's...
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.160]   If Microsoft had done this, howls of protest and pain.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   Actually, they did.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.520]   It was called Windows ME.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.200]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.840]   I mean, there's Windows ME is a good example, right?
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.680]   Because it doesn't have that much of a graphical improvement.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.880]   Supposedly, there's a lot going on under the hood.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.120]   I think there's more performance improvement going on under the hood with Snow Leopard
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.560]   than there was with me.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.760]   But there's a raging debate in the Buzz out loud crowd about whether this should just
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.400]   be called a service pack.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   It is.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.080]   I think it's more than a service pack.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   Here's what bugs me.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   I think it's appropriately priced.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   Here's what bugs me.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.560]   It feels like Apple had a lot of improvements.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.640]   They held back over the last two years.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.560]   Mine are little things in the system preference pain, you know, 5, 12 by 5, 12 icons.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.600]   We've got to have that.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   You know, they did some really nice stuff with the assistive technologies.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.000]   So my blind friends are saying much improved.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   But these are all things.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.080]   If you ask me that they could have been releasing over the last two years, somebody somewhere
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.520]   wrote a memo saying, let's just hold these back and we'll release it all on a disk and
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.320]   we'll call it a new version.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.480]   To me, this is marketing.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.600]   This is about Apple having something to counter Windows 7 a month earlier.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.440]   I just don't think this is a new operating system or even it's barely anything at all.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.680]   Wasn't it supposed to integrate ZFS?
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   This is what really pisses me off.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.040]   Not only did they pulled it out, they pulled it out of server also.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.040]   They're not going to do ZFS.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.600]   It's basically what Microsoft did with Vista when they pulled out.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   With the benefits.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.040]   So it's like, you know, you're touting all these new, you know, engineering benefits and
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.520]   progress and then you take it out at the last minute because either A, it's not stable.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.440]   B has conflicts or C has way too much overhead for what they want.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.200]   So I don't know.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.860]   It seems one of those things where Apple, it does really seem like they're trying to
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.160]   get mind share right before the release of Windows 7.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   That may be.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.680]   I think part of the reason they're doing this though is to get off of the PowerPC legacy
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.680]   support.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.880]   I think that's the biggest advantage you get from Snow Leopard is getting some of your
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.240]   disk space back.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.040]   I've heard people getting up to 20 gigabytes of disk space.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.440]   Now a lot of that's print drivers.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.720]   And that's the thing is when I install OS 10, I selectively install.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.760]   I don't do the multi language.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   And I.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.760]   That saves gigabytes right there.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.600]   So in a way, it's a company saying we were installing too much stuff.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.040]   So we're going to install less stuff.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.440]   Ooh, it's an upgrade.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.240]   And there's some legacy code gone too.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   I saw a bigger jump from Tiger to Leopard.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.640]   Oh, it's much bigger.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.960]   So the buzz out, this is interesting.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.880]   The buzz out loud crowd is also saying this little pushback.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.680]   There's a good debate over.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.640]   My opinion is this this is appropriately priced.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.400]   I think it is more than a service pack here, but it's not a full operating system jump.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.480]   And so they charged 30 bucks for it.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.400]   You could make an argument should have been 15 or 10 or something like that.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.720]   But I think they're I think they're 30 bucks isn't a lot.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.360]   I think they've got something there to charge for.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.760]   Molly opposite.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.360]   She thinks it's a service pack.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   She has.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   There's that.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.320]   But yeah, and a lot of the listeners agree that, hey, they should like you were saying
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   earlier, they should have just been releasing this over time anyway.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.800]   That's what I kind of bugs me is that they maybe were abusing us a little bit by not releasing
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.760]   these fixes over time.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.320]   There's a kernel patch in here that has been a bug, a major overflow bug security flaw for
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.800]   some like four years that they finally put into this.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.360]   It's stuff like that.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   Come on, Apple.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.200]   Just release this stuff as you come up with it.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.600]   You don't have to hold on to it.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.240]   You know, if you were a cynic, you could say that Apple is basically testing the waters
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:28.440]   to see if the public will accept the low cost or relatively low cost, incremental OS 10 update
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.520]   and they kind of see that as they continually seed out new versions of OS 10 on like an annual
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   basis.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.160]   So it's only 30 bucks upgrade today.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.840]   Well, they've been doing every other year.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.160]   They've been on a hundred twenty nine bucks.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.320]   They've been doing fine.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.560]   So, you know, maybe they maybe they eventually want to get off the hardware train and just
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.560]   want to start pushing.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.960]   Oh, I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   Even pog said that anybody who doesn't like snow leopard is a what do you call him?
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   A jerk.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   A jerk.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   No, he didn't say no.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960]   He said a hater.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   A hater?
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.760]   He said anybody who says snow leopard is just a he said there are haters who will say snow
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.400]   leopard is just a service pack.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.560]   I say I don't know.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   He said, fiant.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.560]   I don't know.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   I'm not a hater.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.120]   I'm kind of like he I think that these guys are saying this in the first place.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.640]   I think that Mossberg and pog really over hyped this.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:27.360]   And I think really that what I'd like to say is I'd like to say is that this is fine.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.280]   But please don't rush don't get in line.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.280]   Don't worry.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.640]   In fact, I wouldn't even get it now because there are compatibility issues and you're
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.020]   not going to see any real benefit to this until somebody writes software that takes
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.200]   advantage of grand central station or whatever the hell it's called.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.280]   I put the I put the developers version on one of my Mac a one of my older Mac laptops
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   just to try it out.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.760]   But I didn't want to put it on my main one and I pre or I pre ordered from Amazon which
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.000]   kind of is a mistake because I don't get it until Tuesday now where I could have just
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   gone to the store.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.200]   But I don't really care because it's like yeah, I'll get it when I get it.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   There's no her upgrade.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.840]   It's there's no that's the message.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.120]   I'd like to say there's no hurry.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.360]   So John, you have any opinion on this?
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   There's just come.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.280]   I would like to know I would no one has explained with any uh uh uh uh alacrity.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.960]   Why are there compatibility problems with the versions for example of uh Photoshop?
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.520]   I mean what is changed in the kernel that has resulted in compatibility issues?
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:27.240]   Apples explanation as I understand it is that well there are uh tools that used uh
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.560]   unapproved API calls, things we warned them not to use.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.560]   We took those out so you're going to see but almost all of these programs like SuperDuber
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.120]   and so forth are being updated right away.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   I think you could just wait.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.120]   It's no leopard when you get a new machine.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.000]   They're not going to upgrade CS2.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Well this is a you know this is a good question.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.600]   Yeah uh Adobe's using this as an excuse to move people off of CS2 and 3 saying well we're
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.520]   only going to guarantee support in CS4 but apparently from I've heard a few people say
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.640]   no CS3 works fine.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.240]   It's just that Adobe's not going to make any effort to support but I think this is Adobe
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.080]   using just saying well cool great we finally get these CS2 people that buy a copy of CS4.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.800]   Yeah CS3 apparently there's a great uh wiki dot snowleopard.wicky.com where they have
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.300]   the whole compatibility thing.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.000]   All of the compatibility issues on everything.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.240]   CS2 has apparently got problems under Rosetta as you would expect.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.120]   CS3 has got minor bugs in Photoshop and Dreamweaver and I think that's where we're hearing about
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   right.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   It's all the Photoshop stuff.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.600]   Yeah and if you need exchange if you want to use Apple mail with exchange.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.560]   Hey big it's a big upgrade and it's probably worth 30.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.720]   Get your company to upgrade their exchange servers.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   Yeah really.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.360]   Or get off of exchange.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.600]   I just think it's got there are few specialty markets that are going to want snowleopard
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.720]   but for most people they should just be aware don't run out this is not what you call a
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.880]   typical OS upgrade.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.520]   Don't run out and get it there's no hurry.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.880]   I wouldn't put it past Apple to start putting out some things that kind of encourage you.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   It's only 30 bucks.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.240]   I mean it's not I mean look I have I bought 10 licenses.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.000]   Yeah it was about two of the family packs.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I bought two family packs.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   It's cheap.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.240]   It's 43 bucks on Amazon says the under 86 bucks I get 10 licenses.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   It's cheap.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.920]   That's the thing if you if you run into any reason to get it get it it's cheap.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.200]   But you like you say don't don't be in a big hurry.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   I mean the quick time stuff is kind of interesting.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.680]   How much how much was QuickTime Pro in the past like 20 bucks?
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.840]   30 bucks but you lose QuickTime Pro.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:32.000]   You get the new QuickTime which is not pro it's much less than actually replaces pro.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.440]   If you have QuickTime X has a lot of missing features.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   Yeah if you're.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.960]   We ever get to the point where we say that that that that an upgrade that probably should
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.320]   be free and is $30 is actually quote unquote cheap.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.960]   I think there's more in here than than would need to do is wondering.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.320]   So so you're talking about QuickTime 7 X.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.720]   Yeah 7 it's you use an optional install it's still in the disk and you can install it.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.840]   They want you to use X which doesn't do as much as pro does.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.760]   I think they're going to still sell pro you could still upgrade 7 to pro.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.880]   I still have a final cut on here so I can't really get rid of pro.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   You need it.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880]   I need it to export video.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880]   Exactly.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.360]   It's a strange thing they did with that.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.120]   I don't really quite understand that.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   Very bizarre.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.680]   I'm going to do Mac break on Tuesday and all the fanboys on Mac are going to yell at me.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.200]   I just to me it's like okay.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   Apple didn't in their defense didn't say it's the greatest new thing ever happened.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Exactly.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   It just seems like it seems like this is less.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:32.000]   It's less than well maybe because Windows 7 is considered such the hype.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.800]   I think this is a marketing more marketing than anything else.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.040]   I think they said we got to have something to respond to Windows 7.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.840]   Guys hold back any improvements you want to make.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.560]   We're not going to push them out as an update.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.400]   We're going to do it as a quote polish of leopard.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.800]   This is our response to Windows 7.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.840]   I think this is driven by marketing not by technology and that's what I don't like about
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.120]   it.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.920]   That's really I think it's a great.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   I'm a hater.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   I'm a hater.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.080]   You're coming to get me David.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.680]   Are you going to start just taking all your Macs.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.000]   No, no, I love my Macs.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.360]   I have to say I did upgrade.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.280]   I did know I upgraded this Mac in front of me to snow leopard and one of my absolute
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.320]   critical drivers wouldn't work so it's back down to leopard.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.640]   I've kind of met it myself for falling for the hype.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.840]   Anyway, it's not that big a story.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.680]   I thought I'd start with that so that we can get that out of the way.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.000]   Now a story for John.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.960]   The Kennedy family is using Twitter to update people on the funeral.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.360]   They started a Twitter account, Kennedy News at Kennedy News in which you could follow
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.280]   the vigil and the whole thing.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.440]   It's kind of creepy.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.200]   So it is terribly creepy.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.800]   No, it's it's you've taken a very solemn ceremony and you've kind of.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   We're tweeting.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.800]   Oh, hold on.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.680]   Don't move the casket too quick.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.920]   I got to tweet it.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.360]   This got a nice picture of Teddy.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.080]   It's really you know, they call it Kennedy News, but really they could have called it like
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   the Kennedy wake.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.920]   Yeah, I mean, I've seen worse things on Twitter on the tell way, you know.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.440]   This is probably some aid who's hired to just kind of update.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.640]   It's like live blogging.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.360]   Paul Barres have picked up casket.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   Why not live blog if you're not?
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.760]   It's a verified account.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.080]   I am not a verified account.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.440]   I'm not a verified account either.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.560]   And I've begged them to give me a verification account.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   They won't do it.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.960]   The dead Kennedy is a verified account.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.720]   Is this Jell-O-B-F for really running this?
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.360]   Yeah, I was wondering about that.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.520]   All right, enough of that.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   Nazi punks.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.360]   You know, will Jell-O come back with the band?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   No, I guess not.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.680]   I guess that's not going to happen.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.000]   That's not in the cards.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.200]   I'm so bad today.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   The one.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.800]   FTC is banning robo calls unless it's a robo call that really bugs you that they're going
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.960]   to keep.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.400]   Tom, which one's so so there's a I'll give you the good news first.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.000]   The FTC chairman, John Leibowitz, said American consumers have, quote, "made it crystal clear
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.080]   that few things annoy them more than the billions of commercial telemarketing robo calls they
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.880]   receive every year."
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.880]   From now on, starting September 1st, violators of the new robo call prohibition will pay penalties
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.520]   of $16,000 per call unless you're in one of the exempt categories.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.520]   What are those exempt categories?
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.440]   Well, the exceptions start out pretty good, right?
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.400]   If somebody's not trying to sell goods, but maybe providing information like flight cancellations
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   or delivery.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   That's okay.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   Those are allowed.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   I want those.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.720]   Notices from debt collectors, however, are also given an exception.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.640]   I guess there's an argument for that.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.000]   Those not covered include politicians.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.400]   What charities the contact consumers directly to banks ensures phone companies survey calls
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.200]   and certain healthcare messages.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   What?
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.240]   That's pretty much all of the people that call me already.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.320]   You know who can't call me my elementary school can no longer call me.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   That's it.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.360]   I can't think of any robo call I've ever gotten that doesn't fall.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.760]   You know, that's the thing is robo calls are great if you need to spread.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.480]   For example, school's closed today, keep your kids at home.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.760]   You don't want to pay someone $12 an hour to call people.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.320]   Has anybody, John, you must have registered on the Do Not Call registry.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.560]   Did you have your registered on that?
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   Does that work?
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.560]   No, I have.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   No.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   The robo call still comes through.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.240]   The robo call that I get over and over and over and over again is from some carpet
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.240]   cleaning company.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.400]   Does anyone get a one where you're says your car or car or you know what?
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   This is targeting.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   Oh, that's a scam.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.160]   That's just an out and out of Jeff fraud that car warranty.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.680]   They take your credit card and charge it up the wazoo and you get nothing.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.000]   But that one they're already went after.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.360]   They've prosecuted that guy.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.920]   But you're right.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.920]   This would that would be banned.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.960]   That would be banned even though it was already illegal because they were a fraud.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.360]   That's not a business.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.280]   Oh, too late.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.080]   The numbers already on the national Do Not Call registry should not be getting live and
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.800]   prerecorded telemarketing calls.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   But I do.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.760]   Unless you do business with the company so your bank can call you your cable company.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.680]   Yeah, but that's not the people that are annoying me.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.360]   Did you ever get your carpet cleaned by this company at any time, John?
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.880]   No, why would I want to do that?
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.160]   I tell people that you had a great, this is a robo call, but anybody ever calls me trying
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.080]   to tell me something I just say don't accept phone solicitations for anything.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.920]   I don't know them from Adam.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.600]   My wife is a sucker for these.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.760]   There's a charity.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.720]   Any charity that has the word police in it, she'll give money.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   I have a good, yeah.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.880]   The police, I used to work in a boiler room for summer.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.880]   Really?
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   Wow.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.920]   I had to have the one best sales for one day and I realized that it was just random numbers.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.080]   And I just got to see a bunch of scams from both sides.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.840]   There's people that scan them with the boiler room.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   Oh, really?
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.560]   Oh, I'd like to know how to do that.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.920]   Yeah, you do that by ordering something and then when they bring it over, you somehow
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.480]   you get to receipt, but then you send the product back and you end up keeping the receipt
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.760]   and you stick the government for it.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.280]   And that guy that was running the place, yeah, yeah, he's got every year, and there's
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.520]   one company in Oakland.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.520]   They do that every year.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.240]   But he makes enough money.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   It's okay.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.960]   It's a cost to do in business.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.120]   It's like, you're painful.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   So there's this one, it's kind of something like California Youth Police Youth Charity.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.360]   Well, this was the one I was working for.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.800]   One of the things they did was one of these phony baloney basketball game for the police
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.200]   farmer, some crap.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.000]   And the thing is, it's hard to really know what the deal is, but when somebody calls
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.480]   me, I'm always flabbergasted, I go, oh, my wife just got that call on the other line.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   That works.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   And the guy goes, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.640]   So they either go, oh, I'm sorry, sir.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.840]   And then they hang up and say, oh, what was the disposition?
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   I said, I don't know.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.840]   You have to talk to her.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.480]   And it was, you know, call her.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.200]   But it gets them off that, you know, the script that they have.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   That's the key.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   Get them off the script.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.680]   I usually get the police skip jumps.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.160]   You have to do you have to do it.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.160]   Skip jumpers.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.160]   Yeah, they're using cobalt.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   What is it?
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.760]   What was that line skip?
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.160]   Skip jump jumpskip or something.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.160]   That's so crazy.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.160]   So I looked it up.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160]   So my wife pledged money to them, right?
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.640]   And I looked it up and they're being sued by the state of California for not a kind
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.880]   of fraud for pocketing a significant percentage of the funds.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   So another one, they're non-profit.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.800]   Yeah, they're, they're, they won't say exactly what percentage goes to helping kids play basketball
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.720]   against the police or whatever it is they're playing basketball against the police.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.640]   I used to get one solicitation from the sheriff's department for like rodeos and stuff.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.640]   If it's the actual sheriff, I'll give them money.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   I don't mind because maybe they won't arrest me.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.880]   But I, but what is the deal?
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.520]   I'm John, you would know this in California.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.520]   You see these license plates.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.120]   They say the CHP 411 founder, whatever it is foundation.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.640]   And the scam, the supposedly the scam is you pay these guys a lot of money and you never
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.640]   get a ticket again.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   Yeah, I doubt it.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.760]   I mean, I know in Texas, they have a little sticker that you get and you put on your car
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.800]   window right near the window.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.560]   So the cop sees when you come in the, you know, the only, the one way, these are generally
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.040]   you're not going to get out of a ticket no matter what they tell you.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.120]   Unless you're, unless you're, unless you're an ex-police man and you're actually contributing
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.480]   to some retirement fund.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.800]   Now there is, there are different ways of getting out of tickets with certain kinds
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.400]   of, you know, things that you can get from the cops.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.000]   Courtesy badges are one way of doing it.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And but generally it's bad.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.120]   Yeah, there's just a little miniature badges are about so, they're about like an inch size
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.680]   and they're usually exact copies of a real badge.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.240]   And it fits right in the wallet conveniently that's your driver's license.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.000]   And they're from all over the country and.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.520]   I know you know about this.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.920]   Sounds like a Mason kind of.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.720]   You know who had, you know who I got a, one of those courtesy badges from, from Luke Ryder.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.680]   I had the one from the, from he had the badge from the DA's.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:57.880]   In fact, he still has his badge from the New York Queens district attorney's office and
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.800]   like to get out of jail free card.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   It's pretty much the same thing.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.240]   I used it once.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.640]   I don't get pulled over much because I drive like an old lady.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.920]   But I have.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.000]   And so mainly because I got a speeding ticket doing a hundred or something.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.840]   So now I drive like an old lady.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.680]   But but I pushed the button on the cruise control now because I know I can get another
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.240]   ticket because it's painful.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.640]   You have to go through traffic school.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   It's ridiculous.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.640]   I did that recently.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   Yeah, good.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.960]   But I didn't have my little courtesy badge with me.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:29.680]   I did have it with when I was pulled over in Los Angeles once and I show them, I pull
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   out the wallet.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.520]   You kind of make it clear you get this little, the little courtesy thing and he's did, they
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.600]   didn't, they grill you that you have to be able to answer some questions.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   I throw the answer.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   Somebody.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.200]   I throw the badge and you know, what is that doing there?
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Who would you do?
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   And you know, all this stuff.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.360]   I throw the book at him.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.960]   I'd say what is your question?
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   You know what?
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   It's different.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   It's different.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.120]   I was working for the air pollution district.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.160]   We had a lot of during the era when they had, they had cops working there pulling people
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.400]   off from for their cars, smoking too much.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.120]   And all of them were ex cops and they all had these little badges in their wallets.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.840]   And the story I got, which was kind of interesting is one of the guys was a Sonoma County Sheriff's
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.200]   Department guy and he had the little courtesy badge in his wallet and he got pulled over
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.160]   by the highway patrol and the guy laughed at him when he showed him the badge.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:21.560]   And it turns out with the California highway patrol specifically, unless you have a California
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.760]   highway patrol courtesy badge and you'd worked there before, they won't pay any attention
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.760]   to this.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.760]   You have to have the right badge.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.560]   And you need the right handshake.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.280]   Even when I was doing, when I was doing search and rescue search, a sticker you could get
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.680]   from the sheriff's department and they said, this will not get you out of tickets.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   Don't speed.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.880]   You might get somebody let you off of the warning because they're feeling nice that day, but
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.600]   it's no different than any other.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.040]   You can't show for you can buy like your way out of.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   I hope not.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   I would you can.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   I just off the Fran.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.240]   I just, well, yeah, you can't, we're not supposed to for it.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.600]   You can in Chicago.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.600]   My name is daily.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.000]   What do you say in Chicago?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.680]   Now in Chicago, the trick is if anybody wants to know, not that I study this stuff, but
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.080]   the old trick in Chicago, and I think it changes to make sure that they keep only the locals
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.000]   of where, how you're supposed to do this.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.840]   So don't use this technique because they'll change it tomorrow because you tell them.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:23.080]   The old trick in Chicago, according to everybody I know, is you keep your drive, it's ridiculous
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.320]   that it just even works.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.080]   I've never tried it and I wouldn't do it.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.040]   And I don't recommend it.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.400]   But you have your driver's licenses in a.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.320]   It's wrapped a $100 bill.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   Okay.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.880]   And then a holder and behind your driver's license is a folded up 100 or a 50, I think
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.320]   you can probably get away with.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.080]   And the cop actually drives as you pull out this little holder that's completely, and
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.640]   you give it to the cop.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:52.480]   The cop, supposedly the cop will turn around and look at the license and then you'll give
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.720]   it back to you and then the 100 will be gone.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.480]   And he tells you it's in Mexico.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.480]   Go on your way.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.480]   Go on your way.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.280]   Now, I don't know that this works.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.520]   I've never tried it, but I've had more than a few locals tell me that this is what you
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520]   do.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   I wouldn't do it.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520]   If I were a cop and I, and I.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.640]   It's a pretty low risk way though, because at the worst they're going to turn around
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.840]   and go, why did you put this in here and say, Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.840]   I didn't realize that.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.840]   That's where I didn't.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.920]   I didn't get my money in front of him.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   No, that's a very low risk trick.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   I'd be pissed.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.480]   I'd double the ticket.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.840]   I don't like it.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.800]   I didn't, you know, I did get pulled over once I didn't know the trick, but I got pulled
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.720]   over once I was rushing to the airport.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.200]   And it was really funny because the cop pulled me over and I think he expected something,
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.720]   but then he realized I was in a rental car from California and he brushed me off as fast
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.280]   as he could to get rid of me.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   Why?
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:46.320]   Because he, because he needed to go find somebody that had $100 in the back of the thing.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.320]   I was just a loser.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   You know, I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.120]   You don't know how to bribe me.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.520]   You're going to get out of here.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   You did not know how to pay for I'm.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.520]   You're not.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.240]   It's kind of an expensive bribe.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.080]   I think I'm ex-craking get away with like 20 bucks.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.000]   My wife was arrested when she was younger.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.960]   She was backing her car.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   She lived in Guadalajara.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:14.040]   She was backing her car out of the driveway and a guy in a motorcycle ran into her.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.120]   And she said the rule is whoever bleeds, you know, was the victim, right?
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.320]   So he caught himself or something.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.360]   So they came, the cops come and they get in the car with her and say drive to the jail
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.720]   because they don't have a car.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.920]   So they drive to the jail.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.520]   So she drives herself in her car to the jail and put her in jail.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.200]   And her friends came with the fifth whiskey and that was it.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.360]   It's all good between the fifth whiskey got her out.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.840]   Yeah, that's pretty cheap.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   I don't know.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.840]   Well, she shouldn't have been in jail in the first place.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.440]   I wonder if I could get by with utter pops.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.680]   It's a hot hot.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   It is.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.680]   Otter pops.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   It's a really hot day maybe.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   Any flavor you want.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.840]   I got whiskey flavored otter pops.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.080]   But she says now she's got a record and she's like very proud of that.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.800]   They gave her, they actually, she, I think she, oh no, that was another time.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   She's done time.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.280]   That was the other time she got arrested.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.480]   How often is your wife get arrested?
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.120]   Well, she's got two strikes now.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.120]   Uh oh.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   Two strikes.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.720]   Do you see the state of California or just in general?
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.560]   No, one was, yeah, one was in California and one was in Mexico.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.920]   I probably shouldn't be talking about this.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   Was it was the one in California?
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.920]   Yeah, well you'll be hearing about it later tonight.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   A matter of public record.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   Or misdemeanor.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.120]   You might as well work overtime tonight, Leo.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.680]   It was in, yeah, I'm not going home tonight.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.760]   I'll sleep here on the Twit cottage.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.640]   It was in a Plumas County, I think.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.440]   She wants to go up there and get her mug shot.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.000]   She thinks it would be nice to have your mug shot.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.840]   Yeah, you should be able to have your own mug shot.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   You should have your mug shot.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   You could do it at home.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   You can get your file from the FBI.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.680]   Why can't you get your mug shot?
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.360]   She says she was waiting to line once at the cops and some lady comes up.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.360]   I want my mug shot.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.480]   So she's got, now she's got in her head that you can do that.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.600]   You can go up and demand your mug shot.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.280]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.400]   I'm going to call my wife and see if I've got a place to live.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.480]   Tell her that she's no good not to listen to it.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.880]   Yeah, you know what's funny?
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.120]   I don't have to worry about that.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.800]   She is never once listened.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.720]   Not only to Twit, but to any show.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.720]   Tell today.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.040]   This would be the one she'd listen to.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.680]   She's probably watching live today for the first time ever.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.960]   She said, I went over to the neighbor's house and I wanted to watch the show.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.840]   So I went to twit.live.tv and there's a naked woman's butt on there.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.400]   I said, what?
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   Where did you go?
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   Twit.live.tv.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.560]   I said, I don't own the live domain.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.560]   I don't know where you went, but that's not live.tv.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.560]   Live.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.560]   Go to live.tv.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.160]   I said it would happen.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.200]   The same thing would happen if you put Jennifer.live.tv.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   There's nothing to do with me, but she still blames me for that.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.640]   She thinks I've got, she thinks I'm putting porn on me.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   Yeah, you should be driving a better car.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.200]   She would drive in a much nicer car, exactly.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.600]   And a much more interesting set of friends.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   Yes.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   Honey, if only.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.880]   Hey, let me tell you about the folks that go to my PC real quickly.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880]   We'll get back to the stories.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.720]   We have some very good ones, I think, better than so far.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.840]   God, I hope so.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   Dig something up.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.520]   Will you, Roger?
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.040]   Meanwhile, let me tell you about go to my PC.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.840]   If you're looking at folks at Citrix, Citrix, of course they do the best remote access software
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.280]   out there.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.920]   Go to my PC is going to really help you.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.240]   If you are spending time in rush hour traffic because you had to get to that office PC,
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.120]   if you'd like to be with your family more, spend more time at home, skip the frustration
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.360]   by working from home when you want to on your schedule with go to my PC.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.760]   Sometimes people say, "Oh, I don't want to do that.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.760]   I don't want more work."
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   It's not.

[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.920]   and tear.

[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   It's amazing.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.440]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.360]   We thank them so much for their support of this weekend tech.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.840]   Moving right along.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.080]   You were saying there were a number of studies this week that said only kids, I mean only
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.080]   adults use Twitter.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.040]   Kids don't like the Twitter.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.800]   Yeah, well, you were saying that was a mistake.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   There's a bunch of them.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.960]   Now this guy, Jeff Cook on TechCrunch, says, "Actually, you're not looking at the data
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   very closely.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.080]   In fact, the problem is nobody's looking at the data of the people over 17."
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.320]   He says, "We recently ran a survey of 10,000 plus US teens, 13 to 17."
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.840]   To see if we could add anything new to the question, it turns out the question is flawed.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.480]   Reasons given for the alleged aversion have ranged from condescending because they have
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.600]   nothing to say to because it doesn't feel safe because they can't afford it.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.160]   All these reasons are predicated on the widely accepted notions that teens don't tweet.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   But the fact of the matter is we haven't figured that people above 17 also don't post
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.160]   on Twitter.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.160]   Nobody tweets tweets.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.320]   Scubble said Twitter's worth $15 billion.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   Nobody tweets.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.520]   Facebook is only 9% teen while Twitter is 11% teen.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.280]   So actually Twitter has more teens on it than Facebook.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.720]   Hey, that's the zombie from that.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.720]   John's dancing.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   Oh, is that...
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.160]   Oh, I know what the song you're talking about.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   Yeah, I love that game.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.800]   The voodoo voodoo something.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.000]   You play basically, you play a voodoo doll that has to get your...
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.640]   What is that from, John?
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.880]   You know, I was hoping you guys would tell me.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   Voodoo something.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   Xbox.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.640]   The point of this whole story is all these Twitter stories are for bunk.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   It's all bunk.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   It's all high.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   What Twitter story would I miss?
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.640]   Voodoo Vince.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.400]   Oh, you know, the story that teens don't tweet.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.800]   It turns out they do tweet.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.760]   There's a higher concentration of teens on Twitter than on Facebook.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.760]   The problem is...
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.760]   I think that's a lie.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.240]   The problem is nobody tweets.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.800]   That there's these millions of people who have accounts, but nobody's tweeting.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.840]   I tweet about two or three times a day.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.560]   I tweet two or three times a week.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.960]   I tweet maybe once in a while.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   There's a...
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   Pill you can take those.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.480]   You guys are all Twitter haters.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   Oh, the worm has turned...
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.480]   So much hatred.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.480]   Federal...
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   So this little guy here?
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.080]   This came out of this game, whatever it was, was 2003.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   Voodoo Vince.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.080]   They sent this out as a promo.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.080]   Voodoo Vince.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.080]   Voodoo Vince.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   They have Voodoo Vince.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   He's got a button eye.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.920]   I figured this got to be worth something.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.240]   I have a house full of crap like this.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   Is it pristine?
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.240]   You know what?
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   You should...
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   Is it in the case?
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   Is it pristine?
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   It was never in a case.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   It came like this.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.480]   You know, you should set up an eBay section.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.480]   I think...
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   Crap.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.480]   Crap from my house.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.080]   Roger could come over.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.080]   And what would you take?
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.080]   50%.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   Sure.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.320]   You could take pictures of everything, list it all on eBay.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.600]   It'd be a good business, Roger.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   You could probably make $12, $15,000.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   I could...
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   Probably could, actually.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.600]   I could stay at home all day.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.560]   Set, dig, and receive stuff.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.560]   Work from home.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   Work from home.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   I had to do that.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.800]   I did that for my friend once.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.160]   He signed up for one of those work from home deals with the backup.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.160]   And you did it?
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.200]   No, he ordered it from the back of the popular service.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   What do you get?
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.040]   So he got this one where you had to mow a comb mow hair, which is basically
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   a camel hair.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.440]   They send you clumps of mow hair?
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.440]   Yeah, it's really simple.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   Hey, honey, I got my new shipment of hair.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.680]   You tell me that this work...
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.320]   I thought it was envelope stuffing.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.880]   Or a data entry.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.280]   They send you on a page.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.600]   And as you progress, you send it back and they send you another batch.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   It's distributed...
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.400]   It's basically distributed labor.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.480]   How much do you get per club?
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.280]   It's got to be a lot to make it pay, right?
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   Yeah, but we were all in college.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.040]   I was like, "Yeah, we need money."
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.800]   So you sent it for the TV?
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.200]   No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.960]   It's impossible to comb.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.800]   You follow the direct supposed to soak it and warm water.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   It doesn't work.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   It's just impossible.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   You said screw it.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.600]   I'm just going to get it down.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   Maybe it's a scam.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.840]   Did you pay for the kit?
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.440]   No, no, you send away for it.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   It's free?
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.200]   They just sent you clump of mow hair.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   You send it to...
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   Ask him culture.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.120]   I mean, even if it was a scam, why would you pay money for someone to take hair?
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.000]   Why would you do with your stolen mow hair?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.320]   They're trying to get rid of the mow hair.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.800]   They have a mow hair surplus and they found a way.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   Government fraud.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.320]   So this is an interesting story.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.480]   The federal government and the Obama administration has requested this.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:52.720]   It's a Senate bill they're looking at right now that would give the administration, any
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:58.080]   administration, not just the Obama administration, any administration the right to declare a cybersecurity
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:06.160]   emergency and upon declaration of a cybersecurity emergency, take over private networks for
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.080]   security purposes.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.440]   And there's been a little bit of, you know, fewer around this.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.200]   I mean, if mostly it's partisan, I mean, I think if it were Bush, it would be Democrats
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.120]   complaining and if it were Obama to be Republicans complaining.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:24.000]   But do we want the president to have the right to take over private networks in a national
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   security emergency?
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.280]   I mean, is it couched in the terms of declaring martial law for a section?
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.080]   And you say, okay, right now your company's networks are now run by the government for
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.560]   government purposes kind of thing.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.960]   I think that's the fear.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.300]   It's natural disaster or severe attack.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   Those are the things.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.320]   It's sort of a wartime use of communications networks.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:50.320]   And this bill clarifies to say under the previous laws that allow the executive branch
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.600]   to take over communications networks.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   In 9/11.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.040]   At 9/11, President Bush shut down the airways.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.480]   He said, it's not safe to fly.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.640]   We're not going to let anybody fly.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.560]   That was, you know, he had the right to do that, the legal right to do that.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.960]   So this extended to the unless you're a Saudi prince.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.560]   Did Prince Walid you got to get out of there and get to fly right before the right before
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   went down.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.600]   It's like, oh, you better get on the plane now.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   What?
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   He left.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.240]   He left right before the right before the was right before the closure.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.000]   Oh, yeah, right before they closed up.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.760]   Because you might have stumbled on something if you left before 9/11.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.920]   You know what came.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.720]   You ran out of the country, right?
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.880]   You better leave right now.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.920]   We don't know what's going to happen.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.280]   See, this is how this stuff gets started.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.960]   This is Adam Curry's listening taking notes right now.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.680]   He already knows this.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.880]   Is Adam one of the 9/11 doubters?
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   A truther?
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   A truther?
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   A truther.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   No, that's a birther.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.080]   Is there a truther as well as a birther?
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.080]   It came before the birthers.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.680]   The fact that birthers were named after the truthers, that's how you got it.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.280]   How is it entirely new mythology?
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.960]   So the truthers believe that 9/11 was a government, a US government plot.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   In its side job.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.960]   You can look it up on the Google.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.040]   You can look up truther and you'll find all these links.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.680]   No, there's about six branches of the truthers.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.280]   One of them thinks it's a US government plot.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.600]   One of them thinks it's a guy who owned the buildings who set them up to get blown up.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.760]   There's just a million different possibilities for the truthers.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.840]   The only thing in common that they have is the fact that they think the whole thing was
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.200]   something fake about it and they keep pointing to World Trade Center 7 as evidence.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.040]   And Adam is one of these?
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.000]   Adam will tend to, yes.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.880]   What is it in the human constitution that makes us want to believe?
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.880]   We believe in conspiracies.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.880]   We believe conspiracies.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.960]   Probably because of conspiracies.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.040]   The guy Fox thing where they tried to blow up British parliament that was actually tried
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.040]   to happen or that...
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.040]   That was a while ago.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.040]   I don't think that's in my area.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040]   That's where it started I think.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.040]   DNA.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.720]   Well it's the same thing that starts, and I'm going to get a real controversy here when
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.240]   I say this, it's the same thing that starts religions.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   Yes.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.240]   Which is, we want to believe.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.560]   When you go back into the anthropological history people create religions because they
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.760]   want an explanation for things.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.280]   But what if there's an obvious...
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   Obvious.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   What if there's an obvious explanation?
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.080]   A terrorist commandeer to plane and steer it into the building.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.320]   I mean it seems like we even watched that happen.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.720]   What if that obvious explanation is there?
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.840]   Why is it that we want another one?
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.920]   I think part of it is also because people who feel that so many believe people believe
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.440]   in something that obviously must...
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.440]   There must be something.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.440]   I know the secrets.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.440]   Most people are just too dumb.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.440]   There's some secrets.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.440]   There's a secret.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.440]   There's a secret.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.400]   And therefore they a feel somehow in power.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.400]   How are you?
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   And it's a secret.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   It's a secret.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   It's a secret.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   It was a mobile chevron.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.400]   Was it chevron?
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.400]   Yeah, it was standard oil.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   Standard.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   Standard.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   Basically all three of them conspired to remove all the street cars.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.400]   It wasn't even that.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.840]   What they did was they put all their money into electing local officials and putting them
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.120]   in place to have all these street car tracks removed so buses could take over.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.640]   And this was in Los Angeles, Fresno.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.920]   There's a bunch of little towns all over this.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   It's just good business.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.000]   St. Louis was another one.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   That's a good idea.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.120]   I mean, it's a marketing thing.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.600]   So a lot of conspiracy stuff stems from marketing.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.600]   So if I...
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   Snow leper.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.600]   Okay.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.600]   Snow leper.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.200]   No, what I'm thinking is maybe I could buy some congressmen.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.200]   Are they cheap?
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   Depends.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   I don't know.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   I've never tried buying one.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.720]   There needs to be a Web 2.0 site for that.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   I'm thinking, yeah.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.560]   Buy a congressman like they could auction...
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   Like eBay.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   Like eBay.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.560]   No, not like Amazon.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   So you can wait till the specials happen on the weekend and then you can get a cheaper
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   rate.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.560]   It's easier actually just to buy local officials.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   I know.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.560]   I know.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   They could call it Senate.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.560]   And they have a special wooter the day and you get a senator.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.560]   Pelosi woot.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.560]   Pelosi woot.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.240]   Because I'm thinking what I could do is like, I can't get a...
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.320]   I'm a little North Dakota.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.720]   If I got a law passed against radio and TV, that would be good for my business, I think.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.120]   Yeah, absolutely Leo.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.120]   Let's do it.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   Anyway, getting back to Senate bill S-773.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.240]   CNET Newell's has obtained a copy of the 55 page draft of S-7s.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.040]   This is J Rockefeller, said Bill.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.720]   Would quote, "Allow the president to declare a cybersecurity emergency relating to non-governmental
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.360]   computer networks and do what's necessary to respond to the threat."
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.080]   Now I think what it's really aimed at, remember when we found out that the bunch of these
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:00.200]   utility companies that run the nation's electrical grid had Trojan horses and security breaches?
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.840]   And they really hadn't secured their networks at all.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.920]   That's one of the biggest examples of why you would need this is if you just suddenly...
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.800]   The entire power grid got hacked into and you needed to take drastic measures to cut
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   it off.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.320]   I think Katrina was kind of highlighted because when that hit, suddenly every available means
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:23.200]   of communication other than wireless, like TV, radio was out and having to coordinate
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.720]   and respond to all these issues at that time.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.720]   It's huge.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.920]   So why not take over a system that's already in place?
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.920]   Yeah, because the government showed such prowess during the Katrina thing.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.840]   Well no, I'm not saying whether that...
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.960]   You imagine them taking over these networks?
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.240]   Is there a good reason for the government to take over the internet at any point?
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   I think so.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.880]   I don't know that I can think of anything beyond the power grid.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.440]   Power grid is really a big one.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.440]   I don't know.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.480]   I don't think they need to take over Twitter, but I think the power grid...
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.800]   You got to take over because of the porn.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   They got to stop porn.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   No, when they take over, does that mean they take over the DNS servers?
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.120]   They take over all the routing, you know what I mean?
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:07.200]   Well that's my problem with this, is it's written so broadly that they can take over
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   anything they want.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.400]   They can do all of those things.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.040]   And do they even know how to take it over?
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:20.240]   Well this is the other question with Vivek Kundra and Mr Chopra and the lack of a cyber
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   security czar.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.160]   I wonder if we really are better off with these private industry handling this stuff at this
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.160]   point.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.960]   They haven't demonstrated any technology savvy at all.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.960]   And beyond that point...
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.960]   Ever.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.960]   Ever.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.960]   Ever.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.520]   So it's not just this administration.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.520]   I mean is it going to...
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.520]   Is it going to end?
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.880]   Well there's probably some people at the NSA that could do a really good job of taking
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.880]   over these networks.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:51.800]   So that's what I say, instead of wasting energy on this bill, what they should be doing is
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.520]   going after these companies, these power grids that are being broken into and say look,
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   guys, you've got to fix it.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:01.640]   Here's the guidelines that we're going to have an independent third party security
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:05.040]   audit and we're going to make you fix it now.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.400]   Why wait till there's a cybersecurity emergency?
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.040]   Fix it now.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.560]   Why are we worried about when there's a cybersecurity emergency?
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.440]   Yeah, I don't think this should be about fixing.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.760]   The idea with the communications network is we need to keep the lines clear.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.480]   So we're taking over the communications network and we're stopping all non-essential communication
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.440]   until the emergency is over.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.640]   Is there an analog to that on the internet?
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:32.560]   Where you stop people from now because of killing torrents and to keep the lines clear?
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.560]   There isn't.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.560]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   Maybe I should help the MPWA.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.880]   I guess you could actually go in and say I'm going to kill all the P2P protocols.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.880]   Because we need the bandwidth.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.000]   Because we need the bandwidth to fight the emergency.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.200]   My thing is like, so okay, if they do take over, can they suddenly say, well, okay, we
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   have hackers from China.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.280]   We're going to start blocking all IPs from that region automatically and they can do
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.920]   that with the free hand.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.440]   The new version does actually address what I was talking about.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:05.840]   It gives the executive branch 180 days to implement a comprehensive national cybersecurity
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.560]   strategy.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.960]   Thumbs up on that.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.400]   And 90 days to develop a plan to implement what they call a dashboard pilot project.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:20.280]   I guess a dashboard would be a situation.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   But the mandated legal review won't be done for another year.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.880]   So I'm not sure why they're going to wait on that.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.600]   That's one of the questions Declan McCullough asks.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:32.760]   He actually posed four questions to Charles Stewart at the Commerce Committee and has not
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   received a response.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.520]   But that's a valued valid thing to say.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.520]   You got 90 days to figure out a plan, 180 days to implement it.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.600]   Get it out there.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.880]   That's what I'd like to see them work on.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:48.120]   I'm with the FF here where they say, look, there's no real additional limits.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.440]   There's no designation of what makes something a critical infrastructure.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   It's too vague.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.080]   It just needs more clarity.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.760]   Well, they don't understand what they're doing.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.960]   Let's face it.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.640]   But I mean, it's one of those things where under a benign administration might not be
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.360]   much of an issue, but you get one.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.840]   Put Cheney in.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:14.880]   In our chatroom, somebody's saying the problem is that this is treating the internet as
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.960]   US property.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.040]   It's not US property.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.800]   It's not any, it's actually not a national.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.840]   But what isn't it less about the internet and more about private networks?
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.840]   Yeah, it does say private networks.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.600]   But that could include the internet.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.800]   Well, that's what I'm asking.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   You could include Verizon.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:29.800]   Right.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   Well, what about all the backbones?
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.800]   I think there's a lot of private internet.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   Yeah, that's all private.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   There's good precedent.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   No, I understand that.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:41.520]   But if you can't control, you know, major arteries of it, you might not control it.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.520]   You can severely cripple it.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.080]   I think there's good precedent for it.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.000]   What are we going to do when everything is dependent on the internet and they just shut
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   it down?
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   We're screwed.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.440]   Smoke signals and carrier pigeons.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.760]   You can't stop the internet, John.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   It's unstoppable.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.000]   It'll take over the world and turn it to a great wish.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   They got like two backbones.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.400]   You cut those things off and you're done.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.640]   All they have to do is shut down.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.000]   They stopped the internet down in the South Bay when they had, you know, somebody just
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.360]   clipped two wires someplace that was down for 24 hours.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:12.160]   If you kill those 13 DNS servers, the whole thing's down.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.280]   You know, unless you, hey, we should have it.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:18.120]   We should start a project for people to save IP addresses.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.040]   So they don't need DNS.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:24.920]   So everybody should like, we should have a national, we should have a national IP registry
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.840]   so that everybody, if you needed an IP address, you could call me and say, what is Yahoo?
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.680]   Because the DNS isn't working.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.640]   And I could say it's 162 dot 34 dot 78, four dot nine.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   Roger.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   So what are you doing?
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   No, I made that up.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.720]   Um, or maybe we could just wean ourselves off computers and go back to living like our
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   great, great.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.520]   I'm so ready for that.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   I am ready for that.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.320]   Back to farming and traveling by mule.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   Roman mohair.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.320]   Dinkins.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   Send me some mo.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.920]   I'm going to raise a lot of stinking and starving right now.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.120]   Hey, I got a story on this list.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.560]   I want to talk about it.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.560]   Yes, sir.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:05.640]   Gamer study reinforces stereotypes players say that they're fat over 35.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:11.840]   The average video game players 35 has a somewhat larger BMI than normal.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.480]   And if you're a woman player, that's not the music.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.480]   That's the body mass index.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.480]   Not royalty.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   Yeah, not royalty.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   Ask BMI.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.520]   No body mass index or something like that.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.480]   A female player has reported greater depression than women who don't play video games.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.720]   Maybe it's because they are depressed that they play video.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.720]   That's right.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.720]   It's a chicken egg thing, right?
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   Chicken egg or chicken.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.440]   Well, either works in this case.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.440]   Let's ask Veronica.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.400]   She doesn't seem particularly depressed.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   She seems happy.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.080]   Um, you think she's underneath?
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.280]   She's like tears of a clown.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   She's like, what?
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   I can't.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.280]   I can't.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   I can't.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   It's.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   It's.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   It's a.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   It's.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   It's a.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.880]   Is that why she drinks so much brain tonics?
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.480]   She's really depressed.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.080]   I have actually never known her to be.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:54.920]   She's pretty chipper.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.000]   I would not call her depressed.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   She's pretty chipper.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.080]   So I don't think this is true.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:06.360]   Um, Curtis, sexy geek 134 says I've been playing video games since 1978 with the Atari
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   2600.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.920]   When I was six years old, I play about four to eight hours a week with a lot of variation.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.960]   I'd always plan to become a video game designer slash computer scientist.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.000]   Yeah, but pursuit of career as an orthodontist instead.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.160]   He says he's near 35.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.880]   He's not fat and he's not bummed.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:28.680]   I hate these stories because every time you come out with something and say, well, this
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.560]   is sort of the survey shows of the higher percentage of people do it this way.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.560]   I'm not that way.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.960]   I'm not exactly like that.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.160]   No, it's an average kids don't Twitter.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.160]   I'm a kid.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.160]   I Twitter.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   Kids Twitter.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.360]   You, you are upset by the, by the, that's the way all news is.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   I know.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.840]   It's all made up.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:52.120]   You're upset by the tension, the natural tension between anecdotal evidence and fact.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   Yes.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.320]   What's statistical?
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.320]   Statistical fact.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.120]   Well, that's factish fact.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.120]   Factoidish.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   Factish.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.120]   Factish than a.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.120]   How about this one?
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.440]   Here's a fact representative sample.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.200]   Use use a like the entire population.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.200]   Maybe 10.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:13.840]   Use a cell phone, go to jail in Utah after a crash here that killed two scientists and
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.120]   prompted a dogged investigation by a police officer and a local victims advocate.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:25.040]   Utah has passed the nation's toughest law to crack down on texting behind the wheel.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:30.840]   If you should text behind the wheel and cause a crash that injures or kills somebody 15
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:37.640]   years in jail and a fine of, I don't know a lot of money, 15,000, I think it was.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.160]   15 years in jail.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.160]   Hell yeah.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.160]   All for it.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.160]   Go for it.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.840]   If you, I don't think people should be talking on the phone where they're driving around.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   No.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.840]   They shouldn't be doing anything.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   People should be doing a lot less of things.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:54.840]   People eat.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.840]   You know what people should be doing while they're driving around driving.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   I'm watching the old phone.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   Is this the crotchety?
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   Oh, it is cranky geeks.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:04.840]   I accidentally have put together a cranky geeks panel.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.840]   Can we have a show up on the show, by the way?
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.840]   I'll show up.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.840]   I got stuff to do.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.840]   I'm busy.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.840]   Do you do what the day do you tape?
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.640]   We do every cranky geeks on Wednesdays at 12.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.520]   I got things to do on Wednesday.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.560]   I do other shows on Wednesday.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.480]   I can't leave this ball.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.880]   I have to sit on this ball all the time.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.880]   I don't know.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:28.800]   What gets me is like basically all these in-car entertainment systems with DVD players, you
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   know, screens.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.400]   I saw one guy watching a movie on his dash.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.720]   He had like a TV on his dash and he was like-
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   Which is illegal.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   Which is illegal.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.440]   But you know, unless the cop, you know, manages to just pull up right alongside him and actually
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.440]   see him doing-
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.760]   Sir, you were watching that TV.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:47.400]   I had the sling box app playing on the iPhone up, sitting on the dash, watching him realize
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.080]   and then I was passenger seat, but then I realized, oh, this, you know, this is probably
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.320]   a bad idea.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.560]   In California, texting is banned while driving, but you know what the penalty is for texting
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.800]   while driving in California?
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.800]   $100.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   $20.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.800]   $20.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   $20.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   $20.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   $20.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   I almost got-
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   I almost got-
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   I put $100 folded up in my sister's eyes.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   I'm ready.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.360]   Officer, here's $100 for that $20.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.360]   Fine.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.360]   That's done.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.360]   That's wrong.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.360]   This makes sense.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.560]   It's one of those things because I almost got in a collision because the person next to
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:23.720]   me and the lane next to me was texting and they were making a left turn without looking
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.520]   and they were like literally coming into me.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.960]   It's like times like that that you kind of get that road warrior rage where you just
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.520]   want to chase him down and like, you know, crush your car because you're just so-
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.520]   It's like, you know-
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.520]   Hey, don't be a hater.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:40.560]   I think a hater on people who don't properly operate a vehicle in a cage everyone's lives.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.560]   You know what?
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.560]   I think it will be.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.400]   For this one instance.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.200]   You're a hater, man.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.200]   You know?
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   I've done it.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.200]   You've done it.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   We've all done it.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.200]   Texted?
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   Draw it dry.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.200]   No.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   I never texted.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:00.080]   I've actually pulled over and put the card parking the text.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   So I've done that.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.720]   What you can do, you put your hands through the steering wheel.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.720]   This is good.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   And then you can type like this.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.120]   This is the sixth of how-to video.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   While you're driving.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   You know what?
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.640]   You should develop a thumb board for the steering wheel.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.120]   So you have- There you go.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.240]   And then you have a heads up display that has a text.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.120]   It always looks like you're looking straight ahead.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   That's a great idea.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.920]   Do you think I could sell that?
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.920]   Problem.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   That would solve the problem.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920]   It would.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   You'll be like a fighter pilot.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:27.920]   Click, click, click, click, click.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.920]   Yeah, because that's not distracting.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.240]   Ah, it's a business.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.920]   You know, the Swedish regulators are going to ban the word bank from domain names.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.920]   What?
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   Why?
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.920]   If you get a .se.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.920]   They say- You can't be really big bank.se.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:47.360]   They're extending the law that prevents anyone from having the word bank in their name without
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:50.800]   proving their illegitimate bank to domain names.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.800]   So no-
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:52.800]   Oh, you have to be bank first.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.880]   You have to be a bank to call yourself a bank in Sweden.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.880]   They're saying that-
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   That's right.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.880]   That applies to domain names now.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   I think that's one about blood bank.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.880]   Yes.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.880]   You could be a-
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.120]   What about a sperm bank?
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.120]   Okay.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.220]   Maybe in Swedish they don't call it a blood bank or sperm bank.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.320]   What if you have embankment in it?
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.360]   Well, yeah, I mean, I guess it doesn't apply to just-
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.760]   What if it's a river bank?
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   I'm the river bank in.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:15.760]   What if you're-
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.760]   Of course it's Tom Bank and you just happen to be a sweet bank?
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   All right, all right.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:24.400]   Well, you know, isn't that one Dutch ISP going to start doing a metered internet where
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.360]   they'll basically charge you according to what you're using it for?
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.440]   More video, you get charged more data.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   That's a great idea.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.520]   Actually, that's what you always said does should happen, John, isn't it?
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.480]   Good, metering the internet, of course.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.640]   Aren't you a fan of that?
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   Absolutely.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   Didn't we have a big fight over that?
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   Hey, by the way, something came up and I was reading some journals out of, I guess,
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   Australia.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.480]   And somebody came up with another one of my, I think, one of my wonderful ideas from
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.640]   2003 saying that we should license computer users.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   You mean like too many-
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.640]   You mean like too many-
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.520]   It's a hazard and navigation.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.520]   They're idiots.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.280]   They're going for Nigerian scams.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.960]   They're getting viruses all over the place.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.640]   The only reason we have a problem with all these bots is because people are stupid.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.480]   They need to be licensed.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   License internet usage.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.480]   Just like drivers.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.840]   See how well this worked.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:12.840]   License people on the internet.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.600]   Plenty of unlicensed drivers on the road.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.440]   You'll be using license tools to use a computer.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.640]   You'll have to take a test.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.640]   What kind of test?
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.480]   Who would you design that test, John?
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   Yeah, I will.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.080]   I'll be called the Devorak test, like the Turing test.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:30.160]   Well, John used to ask people what search engine they'd use to see if they knew anything.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.600]   And if they said Yahoo or MSN, they'd go.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.920]   You should throw in a couple of questions about wine too.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.600]   That way you can kind of stratify the various-
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.840]   Yeah, like your upscale or a downscaled-
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.000]   Yeah, it's like having a chauffeur's license or truck driver's license.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.360]   You have to have a little more skills.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   More skills?
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.360]   So your bandwidth would be-
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.360]   Let's combine these ideas.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.160]   The bandwidth gets determined by your score on the test.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.600]   Everybody can have internet access, but you're limited to dial up if you don't pass a test.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.600]   That's a good idea.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   I like it.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   That's great.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.600]   You can do less harm, though.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.160]   So if you're a mensom member, are you automatically like-
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:04.160]   Or do you offer that?
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.080]   If you're a mensom member, you'll be booted from the whole system.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.560]   You don't learn that.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.200]   If you're a mensom member and say you're a mensom member, never again.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   And you're on internet too.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.800]   You're not allowed to use the internet, ever.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.840]   Unless you're going to come up with some really good puns.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.760]   Is that your favorite form of humor?
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:27.600]   Well, you know mens is notorious for the typical mensa philosophy is that the highest
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.760]   form of humor is a pun.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.760]   What?
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.760]   You've never heard that?
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:34.760]   Coming from Tom, a pun master.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.960]   Tell Oscar Wilde that.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.840]   He was the master of the pun.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.840]   So the Pirate Bay has been sold to GGF.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.640]   Is it finished?
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.240]   Golden Gate Fields here in Albany?
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.800]   Yeah, no global gaming factory X.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.560]   The shareholders voted to acquire Pirate Bay on Thursday.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:58.760]   The majority of stockholders at GGF gave the acquisition its blessing.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.320]   However, they need 60 million corona.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.040]   They got to go to thebank.com.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.440]   That's $8.2 million.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:07.800]   That's the, I guess that's the fine.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.080]   Is that the fine that they have to pay?
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.960]   And you stay with that Swedish accent Leo, come on.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:18.040]   Trading in Golden Gate Fields shares has been suspended because, uh, QTargit, this
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.960]   stock exchange for GGF is listed.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.440]   So how are they going to, how are they going to get the money to make the acquisition when
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   they're stopped?
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.400]   There's stock is suspended.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.760]   So there's no acquisition yet.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.400]   No, it's no acquisition.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.520]   I'm like a sucker for these voices.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.200]   So funny because I, I work with a, a Swede in it.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.200]   They don't talk like that.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   Of course not.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   I'm coming close to the finish.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   I know.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.520]   That's how the finish, the fins talk that way.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.880]   We have many Swedish and Finnish listeners for whom I, to whom I apologize.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   They're sending you rocks, lots and lots of rocks.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.320]   And he, a coupon.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:55.640]   A rocks CEO, your honey, you know, Berg seat.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:00.040]   He had not heard from GGF in three or four weeks and was very hopeful.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.240]   You're working into it.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:05.520]   Where can I be into it?
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.520]   It's just not right.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.520]   Is it?
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.520]   Now you're not, you're not as lost.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.520]   I was.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.520]   You became an African or something.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.520]   I'm made in Ireland.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.520]   So that's really Irish accent.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.520]   It's a little historical.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.720]   Top of the morning to you.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.240]   And the rest of the day for you.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.360]   Make the road ride up and away on your go.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.040]   And out of the V.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   Under V.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.040]   Well, the road ride for me.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.280]   Raised to meet you under V.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.280]   Oh, to dirt.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.760]   Don't let this hit you in the butt.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.760]   That's good.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   That's like a combination thing.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.760]   I don't know.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.760]   What's the hard one?
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   You know, this whole tech thing fails.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.160]   You can do the personations all day.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   Bad impersonations.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   You can do like those.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.160]   That's my future.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:48.440]   I'm really used to sell novelty phone messages for games.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.040]   Yeah, I could do that.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.040]   Hello, John.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.760]   It's not here right now.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:56.880]   Would you like to leave a message or a loot if it's?
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.680]   Court, let's see, rejects cap on cable market share again.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.000]   This was actually very aggressive.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.160]   And appeals court overturned a rule.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:11.760]   The FCC has been trying as for a long time had a rule that said that a cable company
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.320]   could not have more than 30% of the nation's subscribers.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.080]   You know, Comcast can't have more than 30%.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.240]   Comcast has at 25% and they want to be bigger.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:28.160]   So they sued and a court of appeals said that the rule, the 30% rule, was arbitrary
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.160]   and capricious.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.800]   Actually, it's better if you say arbitrary and capricious.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.080]   And they threw it out.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.600]   Big victory for Comcast.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.160]   Real defeat for the FCC.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.040]   It seems sensible to me that no one media company should dominate.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.760]   Do you mean like, what's the radio clear?
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.760]   Clear channel, totally dominated.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.880]   And by the way, I want to thank everybody.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.400]   Clear channel, forgive me a job.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.000]   So let's not slam Clear channel.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   Okay, Roger.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Yes, radio.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.160]   Are you working with your connection to Clear channel?
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.800]   Premiere, which syndicates my show, is owned by Clear channel.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.320]   Oh, you mean the KFI show?
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.640]   Well, it's all over the country, but there's many of them.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.240]   Yeah, but what kind of money you make from that compared to this?
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   I'm not.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:15.040]   Fearing a cable monopoly, Congress in 1992 directed the FCC to set limits on how many
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   ways.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.280]   Wait a minute, I'm sounding like Linus Torvos.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.760]   Let me get this right.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.600]   The cable companies came in and said, we want monopolies in every region.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   Yes.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.320]   Okay, so make it legal for us to have a monopoly in every region.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.800]   There will be one cable company.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.800]   Yes.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.200]   But then the government said, okay, but we don't want a monopoly for the entire country.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200]   Right.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.560]   And they said, no, no, no, we want one for everywhere too.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.560]   We want the monopoly nationwide.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.360]   So why don't we just cut that cut out all of this crap and say, you know what?
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.000]   The United States grand, just grant a monopoly to one company and get it over with forget
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.640]   free free competition.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.280]   By the way, web 1194 says, we fins don't talk like that.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.200]   Screw you Leo.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   That's exactly how he said it.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.680]   The fins don't talk at all.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.680]   No, that's right.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.360]   That's why they invented texting.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:02.680]   We have, we can thank the fins for this whole texting thing because they didn't want to talk
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.680]   to people.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.680]   They wanted, they were very shy.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.560]   They were as shy people.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.560]   They are.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.760]   And they like to drink.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.760]   Mm.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.560]   That's good for you.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.920]   So I think this is, to be honest with you, I think you're exactly right, Tom.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.640]   I think this is what protects us from an utter monopoly.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:24.160]   I mean, I love that these cable companies are constantly saying we don't want government
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.960]   regulation when they absolutely want government regulation in their favor just as long as it's
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   benefiting them.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:36.040]   Listen to how it always goes rules that benefit someone or always good laws.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.800]   But if, if, if laws that somehow, we always protect free speech unless we're offended by
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   it.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.800]   Right.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.800]   Exactly.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.360]   The FCC led by Obama, pointy Julius Jannikowski said the commission is reviewing the decision
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:53.280]   and will take it into account on future actions to implement the law.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.920]   One FCC commissioner Robert McDowell was more vocal saying, I disagreed with the decision
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.480]   to re-impose the cap in 2007.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.120]   He said this, I knew this, I knew this would happen.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.120]   So he's, he's all for this.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120]   He's all for it.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120]   He's all for it.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   But, but,
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.280]   Do you want Comcast to own 50% of the cable market?
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280]   I don't think so.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   As long as there's unfair competition.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   Exactly.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280]   That's my problem.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.040]   I'm fine with getting rid of a cap as long as you can have local monopolies.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.840]   If you can have local competition as well and I can choose, sure.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.280]   But if I'm locked into Comcast locally, all I can do is go to the red TV dish while we're
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   at it.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.040]   The FCC also protects cable operators from other ISPs using their physical plan, right?
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:36.920]   The phone companies are required to let DSL providers use the central office.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:42.280]   But for years, the FCC said, oh no, cable's an infant industry.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.840]   We have to protect them.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840]   So,
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.840]   Yeah, let them, that's good.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.240]   There's something to be said for that, Leo, which you really want to do.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.280]   You want to think, think in a medicine, say, you'd let them do their own thing.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.320]   Let them have their protection.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.920]   Let them build out the infrastructure.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   And screw them later in the game.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   Right.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   When it later in the game.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   Now it's later.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.920]   No, later.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.360]   It's like a patent.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.720]   The idea of a patent is to protect you for the investment for a limited amount of time.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.520]   I think the cable companies have been protected.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.520]   They dug those ditches.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.920]   Yes, it was very expensive, but that was 30 years ago.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.680]   They've been protected for 30 years.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.680]   All right.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.920]   You want to eliminate this rule that you can't have 30% market share?
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   Fine.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   We'll also eliminate them with you.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.960]   We'll also eliminate the rule that says you have a local monopoly.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.120]   And that's why we're at it.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.440]   Allow ISPs to use the cable for their, so there's a little competition in the internet
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.440]   service market.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.880]   That's the quid pro quo of giving you the protection.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.360]   Verizon's laying their own files cable.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.480]   John, do you know, does anybody know if they're getting any kind of protection?
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480]   I don't think they are.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.320]   I think your theory is absolutely correct.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.680]   It's about time we opened up this backbone.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.760]   It's been long enough.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.760]   It's been long enough.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   They got their money.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   They got their time.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   They got their money.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.360]   If they didn't make their money, well, you know, maybe they made their money.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.840]   So that's one of the ruses they're trying to perpetrate on the people of the United States
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.160]   is that the cable companies are somehow not making money.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.400]   They're making more money all the time.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.240]   I'm with you on that.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.440]   Not if we have any anger against Comcast for any reason at all.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.440]   I like Comcast.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   I think they're Comcast.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.440]   I think they're Comcast.
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.440]   You did?
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.960]   No, I got a severance package.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.720]   They fought me tooth and nails in the severance package.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.120]   You like Comcast, John.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.120]   Is that right?
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.120]   They're Comcastic.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.640]   You just wanted to say that, didn't you?
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.640]   I love saying it.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.840]   My Comcast internet was out last night.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.840]   Really?
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:31.840]   Actually, yeah.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.840]   That's not so Comcastic.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.840]   No, actually, I'll have to say that my Comcast is a lot better than AT&T.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   You know, mine is too.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.600]   Well, I didn't have AT&T, but I had AT&T lines.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.600]   I had a different ISP.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.160]   Do you use Comcast for phone?
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.160]   No.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.160]   No.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.160]   Anybody?
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   You use it?
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.160]   No.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.160]   John, you don't use Comcast for phone.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.160]   I use AT&T.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.520]   Comcast for phone says, "Eh, that's okay."
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.680]   We're willing to stand corrected if Comcast wants to call in.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.080]   Didn't donate.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.280]   1-800-555-1212.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.400]   Give us a ring anytime.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.200]   We'll be glad to put you on the show.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200]   Just Twitter it.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   You'll hear.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   Frank.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   Twitter it.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   Frank will get back to me.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200]   Frank.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.200]   Yeah, Frank.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   Frank Elias.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   Yeah, Frank.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200]   Comcastcares.com.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.040]   Real briefly, I want to mention folks, the great deal that Audible is offering you
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.920]   all for audiobooks.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.320]   Now this is a deal you can get behind.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:30.440]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you can sign up for that platinum account.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.440]   That gives you two.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.000]   Count them two audiobooks from Audible.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   I'm a big Audible fan.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.240]   I have to say, I listen to Audible like crazy.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.800]   What am I listening to?
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.480]   I'm still listening to Game of Thrones.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.640]   That thing is long.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   That's a long-ass book.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.720]   That's only the first I know.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:50.000]   I got them all and it's long, but I'm still in the first, but I'm getting there.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   It's wonderful.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.600]   The guy is such a good reader.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:59.520]   Also listening to a book that Annie Enoco recommended called "Writing Down the Bones
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.520]   for Writers."
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.520]   It's really good.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.120]   I think John went off to...
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.120]   Oh, God.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:08.120]   John's put up a picture of Microsoft Bob.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.680]   I think John's actually...
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.160]   I think John's studio is in the bathroom and he just wanted a little privacy.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.800]   What is he doing?
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.400]   Microsoft Bob, where did he get that?
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.560]   That's awesome.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   He has a lot of that crap.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.560]   He said he did.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   That's probably like a mousepad.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.200]   He should probably turn his house into a museum.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.360]   I think it is.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.040]   I'll tell some stories about John when he's gone, but first let me remind you Audible.com.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.640]   It's a great bookstore of audiobooks, 60,000 wonderful titles.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:40.920]   I love signing into Audible and just to see every day they've done a really nice job of
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.560]   the front page giving you ideas for stuff to read.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.960]   I'm just going to log in here real quickly.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.960]   We can see what's on the front page at Audible.com.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.760]   I don't have a book pick for us this week, but it's all right.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760]   We've got the site.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:58.520]   We can maybe find something wonderful to listen to in business and classics and fiction history,
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:05.760]   science fiction, New James Patterson out at On Sale, 995, the Alex Cross's trial, 995
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.280]   on sale, the Ted Kennedy biography by Edward Klein.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.560]   We recommended that a little while ago.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.560]   Great stuff.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.640]   Go to Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640]   Sign up for the gold account.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.480]   You get two books, two books a month, the first two are free.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.600]   And even if you decide not to stick around, you get to keep those books.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.600]   Here's this good.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.880]   This is a good one.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.960]   This is good for those people who game too much.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.040]   Raise your social IQ.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.960]   How to do the right thing in any situation by Michael Levine.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.520]   How to mix business and social relationships.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.200]   Thank you notes and why they're indispensable.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.920]   Email versus snail mail.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.200]   Guess which one's better.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.120]   How to behave on a first date.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.000]   That'd be good for you, Roger.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   You could use that.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Totally.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.400]   Racism, politics and sex.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.000]   RSVP or else the 10 Commandments of Social IQ, the basics of friendship.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.160]   Just an example of the kind of things that you can learn.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.200]   You're in the car, you're driving home.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.040]   Maybe you had a bad experience on that first date.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.960]   You could get the book out and you can learn.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.760]   Also in sci-fi, they've got the, oh boy, this isn't science and technology.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.760]   The Feynman lectures.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.760]   Oh, nice.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.760]   Wow, that's long.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.840]   There's quite a few of them.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.080]   Wow, this is fantastic.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.000]   I did the tapes of Feynman reading.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.800]   The Feynman lectures on fixer.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.880]   Let's play a little bit.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.280]   If you've ever heard, let me see if you can hear his voice on this.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:34.440]   He had that great New York accent.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.360]   And starting a irregularity in one place, which is analogous to putting an electron
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360]   in one atom.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.560]   We'll ultimately produce irregularities moving all around.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.680]   In other words, the electron makes its way into quantum mechanical analog of the...
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.400]   This guy was so brilliant.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.800]   They have the complete Feynman lectures.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   All...
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.800]   It was at 32 volumes.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.120]   I can't remember 20 volumes.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   All of them on here.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.520]   I didn't know they've got them all now.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   That's crazy.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520]   This is fantastic.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.960]   I have those on a CD collection at home.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   You probably have the six easy pieces.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960]   No?
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.960]   No, it's the lectures.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.960]   The lectures.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:08.960]   This is the one I have.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.840]   The essentials of physics.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.600]   This would be a great one to start with.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.240]   Because it's five hours, six lectures in his inimitable style.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.880]   You'd really learn the basics of physics here.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.440]   It's a couple of tapes from the original Feynman course all these years.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.680]   And they have graciously allowed Addison Wesley to work in partnership with them.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.680]   This is great.
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   That's, of course, the forward.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.200]   I don't know why they do that.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.160]   The current Sword and Laser book is also on there.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   What's that?
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.160]   The Forever War by Joe Haldeman.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   Is it good?
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.160]   It's great.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.160]   What's it about?
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.360]   It's about Vietnam, essentially.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:43.600]   So really, the premise is a guy goes off to fight this alien race away from Earth.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600]   Relativity kicks in.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.040]   When he comes back, everybody he knows is old, close to death.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040]   I love it.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.040]   He's changed.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.520]   So he goes back and reenlists because he can't adjust.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.720]   And Earth isn't welcoming.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.720]   I've read this.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   I love that book.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.720]   That was a...
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.720]   Yeah, it's a great allegory.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.520]   Unfortunately, it's something I actually have to finish reading.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.680]   It started a long way.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.280]   Now, there's two Forever Wars on here.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.520]   Don't get the Dexter Filkins.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.200]   Don't get the Dexter Filkins one.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.520]   It's a different story.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.760]   This is Joe Haldeman, narrated by George Wilson.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760]   That's a good one.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.040]   See, this is why you need two.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040]   It's not even enough.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.720]   So get one, get the Feynman 6 EZ pieces and the Forever War.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.720]   There you go.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.880]   And get your science quotient and your sci-fi quotient.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.240]   They also have many of the books about Feynman on here too.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.240]   It's just a wonderful...
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.600]   Look, you see how much fun it is to browse this bookshelf.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.800]   You get them, you download them, you got them on your iPod, your iPhone, your Zoom, you
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.240]   got them on your Kindle or your GPS device.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.680]   I mean, it's there and it's ready and you listen to it on the way home tonight.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.920]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.920]   Give it a try.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.640]   We know you're in a lot.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.640]   Are you back, John?
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.440]   Oh, I'm coming back.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   I swear.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   Still.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:59.880]   He's got the Microsoft Bob thing up.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.560]   I'm one of the few people that have an unopened.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.560]   That's the box?
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.560]   That's the box Bob came in?
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.560]   Oh, that's unboxed.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.560]   Wow.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.560]   Look at that.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.560]   And it's unopened.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.400]   See, now that's worth a lot of money on eBay.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.400]   I don't know.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400]   It's got one ding in it.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.600]   Oh, it's got two dings in it now.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.120]   Two dings in it now.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.560]   I have actually two unopened boxes of Microsoft Bob.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.560]   They sent me three copies for some unknown reason.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.680]   Now, I'm surprised I thought you stored all this stuff over a Chevron station.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.680]   No.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   I should.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680]   You used to have...
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.240]   You used to have a storage room.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.160]   I remember going in there when we did the radio show in the 90s.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.280]   I needed a modem.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.600]   And Mimi let me in.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.480]   And it was like Fiverr McGee's closet.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.920]   You opened the door and all this stuff cascades out.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.080]   Didn't you have that?
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.280]   And it was over a gas station.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.280]   I'm not imagining.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.840]   That's where we ran a little operation called World Wear 3.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.880]   You want to elaborate?
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880]   What was that about?
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.240]   Well, obviously it wasn't successful.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.760]   Three.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.880]   You can buy it now.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.000]   Microsoft Bob unopened $100 on eBay.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   It's a buy it now?
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   No bids.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   No bids.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   $99 is the $99.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.760]   You're going to have to pay someone to take that all that stuff away.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.480]   I knew if I saved the box it would be worth something someday.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.000]   Does it run on Snow Leopard?
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   It's actually kind of interesting.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.400]   The back of it, I've actually...
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.520]   I blog this about a year ago.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:27.640]   Dad took screenshots of all the back and the front and all the rest.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.240]   It's actually kind of interesting to look at the sales pitch they have and all these
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.340]   little cartoons.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.040]   There are people in Jairim who don't know what Microsoft Bob is.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.840]   Microsoft took it off their timeline.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.440]   Microsoft doesn't even know what it is.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.440]   Never existed.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.120]   Read know nothing about this.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   Very Orwellian.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.560]   You'll be glad about this, John.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.560]   We've been talking on Twit for at least a year about the fact that when you cross the
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.000]   US border, border control has the right to search your laptop.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.160]   I don't mean just like open it up and look at it.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.240]   Go through the hard drive looking for stuff.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.640]   Yeah, they're looking for porn.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.400]   But the Obama administration on Thursday put new restrictions on searches of laptops at
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.360]   US borders.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.960]   A supervisor now has to approve holding a device for more than five days.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   What?
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   Or 30 days.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.200]   Any copies of information taken from travelers machines would be destroyed within days if
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.400]   there were no legal reason to hold information.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.360]   Once we all got a copy, you can destroy it.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.200]   And all personal details that people store on their digital devices, border searches of
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:37.320]   laptops and other gadgets can give law enforcement officials far more revealing pictures of travelers
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:41.400]   than suitcase inspections might leave revealing pictures of travelers.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.400]   Exactly.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.640]   Literally.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.840]   So there are more restrictions.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.160]   A supervisor has to be present during the searches.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.000]   Well, that makes me feel better.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   That means that's everything.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   Look at that.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.360]   You I as a US citizen have to submit to a random search of all surrender my data for up to
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.200]   five days, maybe 30 for no cause.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.200]   Well, no prop.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.200]   There's no proper cause.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.880]   There is probable cause you you you have left the country for five minutes and now you're
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880]   trying to get back.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:16.160]   But that's the thing if if you if you left the country for five years, that's five minutes
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.800]   or five minutes.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.200]   So if I jumped on the line and wait, that's the board.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:27.240]   I went back to Canada a few years ago to Victoria.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.840]   This is the year that they ran out of flu vaccine in the United States, but I knew one
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:31.840]   to get a flu shot.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.080]   So I went to Canada to their hell, their horrible health system and I got a shot up
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.920]   there and I've been that horrible.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.200]   You got the shot.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.440]   You're still alive.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:45.040]   Hey, we're in the back across the border and the guy starts grilling me.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040]   What are you doing in Canada?
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040]   I got a shot, man.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.040]   That I got a flu shot.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.320]   They have flu shots in the United States.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.840]   Actually, this kind of is a matter of fact.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.400]   No, it's a suspicious reason.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.560]   I mean, like don't you need to have a Canadian health card to I got a flu shot in Canada.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   No, actually you don't.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   You just just go out there.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.560]   I was up there working in Toronto.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560]   You have to pay with a Canadian health card.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.240]   Everything is free with a no health card.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.600]   You give me up to pay a fee.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:14.080]   Officers must consult agency lawyers if they want to view a traveler's sensitive legal material,
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.880]   medical records or this is good for you, John, a journalist's work related information.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.400]   You say, hey, this is my notebook.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.240]   Everything in that actually my notebook, everything is my notebook.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.960]   Yeah, wait, they just have to consult a lawyer.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.200]   Yeah, so they have a lawyer there and age lawyers.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.560]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.640]   Can they still take the laptop for five days while they consult the lawyer?
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.240]   Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents cannot keep property for more than 30 days depending
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.240]   on circumstance.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.400]   Well, it's a step.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.640]   It's not much of a step.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   This is still a really good question.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.400]   Well, the question is, do we know anybody out there that's are in a great listening audience
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.040]   that has actually had anything happen to them in this regard?
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.040]   Midneck did.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.040]   Remember that?
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   We had them on.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.040]   But he has enough red flags.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.040]   He does have a history.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.040]   He has a pretty unique history.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.920]   All right, here's the stats between October 2008 and August 11th of this year.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.680]   Customs and Border Protection officers processed more than 221 million travelers at US borders
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:17.440]   only searched 1,000 laptops of which 46 were in depth searches.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.880]   Is that the one where they keep them?
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   That's probably where they keep.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   I still say so.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.720]   So your chances of winning the lottery are better than your laptop?
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.800]   It's 46 out of 221 million is pretty good.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.800]   That is pretty low.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.720]   But TrueCrypt gives you that false bottom OS.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720]   I like it.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.720]   You want to be careful.
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.720]   Is that what they call it?
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720]   A false bottom?
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   That's what I call it.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.720]   I like it.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.720]   You mean the file container.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720]   It's the liability.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.440]   You can give them a TrueCrypt login that unencrypts the hard drive and they don't say it.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.120]   Yeah, it's a nested encrypted.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.120]   I don't know.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:51.440]   The thing is if you notice it and you see how much that file actually takes, I mean,
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.640]   I understand how it works and I've used it.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.880]   I don't know.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.880]   You're stegenography.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.040]   That'll solve that problem.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.040]   Sure.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.120]   You don't see that file in the windows.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.320]   No, no, I understand.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.680]   So when they're going through the thing and they're looking at data.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.320]   But the file size remains the same.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.680]   So if you created it and if you create a small nested file, it wouldn't be an issue.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:12.920]   If you created a larger one, like say 50% of the actual file.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.640]   You just say that's a nested file.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.640]   Is the nested file?
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:22.040]   Well, the question here, because I know about this technique, is the nested file a separate
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.040]   entity?
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:29.040]   In other words, if you have your encrypted file as gopher.com and that's really where
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.680]   you're the container for the encryption and you have a false bottom as you like to put
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.680]   it.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.360]   In other words, a fake password that makes it look like you're unencrypting something
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.240]   and there's a few files in there.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.360]   It's a whole operating system.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.640]   It can be a whole operating system.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.400]   It depends on how you use TrueCrypt.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.640]   I don't know why you'd want that, but that's another story.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.800]   Well, because then when they seize your laptop and they say, "Hey, this is encrypted.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.440]   Give us the password you have to."
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.600]   You give them a password.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.600]   They open it up.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.600]   That launches an operating system.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.240]   They look at the hard drive.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.280]   Looks like it's a full hard drive with very few files.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:05.160]   And you just say, "Yeah, I don't keep much stuff on there."
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.120]   I think Roger, you and I are thinking alike on this.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:13.640]   If you were suspicious of someone you would scratch, I would scratch by saying, "Huh,
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.080]   that seems kind of peculiar."
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   If it's...
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.320]   They've got just normal stuff on there.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.320]   Oh, that's strange.
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   Well, no, but you...
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   I thought you were suspicious.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:27.320]   You have a 250 gig hard drive and yet the OS only seized two hundred.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:30.120]   How do they know you have a 250 gig hard drive unless they take apart the...
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.120]   Maybe the OS lies.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.760]   Well, it depends on what you're running.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.360]   If you're running a PC, you can...
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.360]   In the false bottom lie.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.360]   Because it's a...
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.360]   I don't know.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   I'm not saying that people should be using truth and anything.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360]   I don't know.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.360]   I'm not saying that people should be using truth and anything.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.360]   It's pretty hard to notice.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.280]   Because it launches up the operating system.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.320]   You right click on the hard drive.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.800]   It tells you the hard drive is this big.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:50.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.960]   No, not from the operating system though.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.680]   You do it from either the BIOS or...
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.680]   Wow.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.680]   And the thing is they do take...
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.160]   It's not going to work.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160]   Look at it.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.160]   Let's paint this one.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.160]   I think Roger's right.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.880]   There's a missing piece of this puzzle.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.560]   If it's not going to work if they really have reason to suspect you.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:13.960]   That's my point is that it's like people who fill their tank with enough space to put
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.200]   pot in it.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.440]   And then the border guard's always like start tapping on it.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.520]   It's never worked for me.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.520]   I got to say.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.520]   It's because it's soaked with gasoline.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.520]   I know.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:26.000]   We really don't want to light that joint.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.480]   This pot stinks.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.480]   And it burns weird.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.680]   Dell beats forecasts then surges on Thursday.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:40.200]   Dell reported unexpectedly strong second quarter earnings.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:45.720]   They say that they think business is going to really pick up when Windows 7 comes out.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   They're going...
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.720]   Well, listen.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:51.440]   And this is an interesting thing because then I saw another analyst say don't get too bummed
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.760]   if Windows 7 doesn't drive a lot of sales because it could just be the bad economy.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:04.320]   But I'm glad to see that Dell is picking up a net income 472 million, 24 cents a share.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.160]   That's a decline.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.800]   Well, it's a 23%.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.800]   What?
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.560]   23% decline in net income.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560]   But that's good news.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.360]   That doesn't sound good.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.920]   No, it doesn't.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.600]   Yeah, their profit probably went up because when you know these guys are slashing left
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:24.600]   and right.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.480]   When they say unexpectedly strong, they mean, well, it could have been worse.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.680]   Yeah, which is always like...
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.400]   Ah, they exceeded the forecast.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.920]   That's what they did.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.840]   Oh, I love Wall Street.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.560]   Excluding costs associated with its continuing revamping, the company reported earnings
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:47.000]   of 28 cents a share substantially exceeding the forecast of 23 cents a share.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:53.360]   So even though revenue was down 22%, profits were down 23%.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.360]   They beat their forecast.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.960]   They beat the forecast.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.800]   So they had a great quarter.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.800]   Stock was up 7%.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.600]   This is like a Ponzi scheme.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.600]   It's ridiculous.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.200]   That's just the way Wall Street works, isn't it?
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.280]   You're making money or you're not.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:13.560]   They're losing money, but it's not as much as we thought they were losing.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.600]   It's just like when companies have a positive quarter and make money and then their stock
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:20.200]   gets trashed because they didn't make as much as everybody thought.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.200]   Wow.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.360]   Right, which happens just as often as this bullshit.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.800]   I should have read this story more carefully.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.040]   You know, foolish me.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.680]   I read the headline set of good news.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680]   We beat the forecast.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.680]   Good news.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.320]   We're not sucking as much as you thought we were.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.480]   We don't suck as bad.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.400]   The Dell's really been going through.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.400]   And then here's the press release.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.840]   Dell improves business performance through continued execution of strategic agenda.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:50.640]   By the way, a couple of people in the chat room pointed out when a true crypt volume is
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.320]   encrypted, you can't tell from the outside what's ranked at data and what isn't.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   There's no way to tell from the outside that they could just be hidden.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.320]   It's not what you can tell the size from the outside.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.640]   And if you've got three gigabytes on the outside that you can see as a crowd is true.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.640]   I know.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.400]   I'm not saying that they'll be able to see it, but they know something's there.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.120]   Oh, it's just Slack space.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.120]   No, it's all right.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:13.200]   Yeah, if you go in there and you got three gigabytes showing on your list.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.520]   Yeah, but you can't use it.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.520]   That's a thing.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.120]   And it doesn't look like empty space.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.120]   That's my point.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.120]   None of it does.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.960]   The filled space and the empty space both look the same because it's.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.040]   Now when you go into it, you see one file.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:32.280]   Yeah, if you go into the initial true crypt file and say you do have the false bottom,
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280]   right?
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:37.360]   You say you look at it and it says it has, you know, whatever amount of space that it
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.360]   has.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.200]   It says it has exactly the same amount of space.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.560]   It says from the outside.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.040]   There's a hidden container in there.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.240]   Is this East meat West?
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.400]   Is this what eats me Swiss?
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.800]   Now, I don't talk about tech on it.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.720]   Oh, yeah, you don't want to be snowing the West.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.560]   What do you guys talk about on East meats?
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.960]   Coming up in about half an hour.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.600]   I have no agenda, John.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.000]   I know.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.360]   And we've been doing it since 2000.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:03.360]   That's a great idea.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.360]   One last story.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:11.480]   Did you see the Microsoft ad that in Poland was the black guy was cut out?
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.480]   Yes.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.280]   He was a piece.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.280]   He wasn't cut out.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.280]   He was separate hands.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.280]   He was a white guy.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.000]   Well, his hand was still black.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   Yes.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.480]   Well, Toronto had that thing when they had one of those brochures for the city and it
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.640]   was a Hispanic family and then they put the head of a black guy on top of the man's head.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.280]   And it was a really bad Photoshop, first of all.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.240]   So it was pretty obvious someone shopped it.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.560]   But then a lot of people was like, well, it seems kind of forest.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:41.640]   Why don't you just take a photo of people in Toronto?
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.800]   This is a good document.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.120]   This is kind of like when I got highlights for children and they'd say, find the 15 things
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.120]   wrong with this picture.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.840]   Okay.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.360]   The guy's got a white head and a black hand.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.200]   The monitor actually is not connected to anything.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:04.000]   And look, that generic computer he's on, that's a Mac with the Apple painted out.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   This is good.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.120]   This you could have a little contest in this.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:10.720]   So I wonder if there's some, by the way, the Asian guy was not photoshopped out.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.880]   Just the, just the black guy.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.040]   Is there some sensitivity to anything in Poland or is it just, I mean, what's the deal?
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.200]   I have no idea.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.720]   They don't have any black people in Poland and they didn't want people asking what kind
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720]   of a person is that?
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.920]   The people they have in Poland.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.640]   You sure as Asian, it kind of looks Polish.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.360]   He's an Asian pole.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.360]   They're in there.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.360]   I just love it.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.520]   My favorite part is that there's no wires on that monitor.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.760]   It's just, it's just standing there.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.880]   No, I like the fact that they're all grinning.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   They're all so happy.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.240]   They're like, it's a grinning grin.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.360]   It's like, what are they grinning about?
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   I don't know.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.360]   I have to look at the American one to see.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   Microsoft product.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.600]   It's not news that ads are dumb.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.720]   No, no, that's not.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.440]   Stop the presses.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.440]   Ads are dumb.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.280]   Oh, I see why they're smiling.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.880]   They're empowered with the IT tools they need.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.880]   Ah, that's why they're so happy.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.880]   Oh, yeah, that would make anybody smile.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.880]   Sure.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.880]   Learn more.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:02.880]   Learn more.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.840]   She's, it looked, is that an electric razor she's holding or what is that?
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.840]   She's shaving her.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.880]   She's going to shave her under on try after this is over.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.880]   What is that?
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.360]   It might be a remote.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.280]   I wonder why we haven't found out.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.720]   It actually looks like Vancouver.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   I think they're in Vancouver.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.600]   Yeah, it does look like Vancouver.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.800]   That's a Vancouver backed product.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.800]   That blue glass.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.520]   Yeah, it's definitely Vancouver.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.520]   Okay.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.640]   Optimize your business productivity infrastructure.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   Yes, indeed.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.440]   I can't even think.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.600]   Okay, just from this, can you tell what they're selling?
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.600]   No.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.600]   Microsoft.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.600]   It's IT.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.400]   It's supposed to be very up to you.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.240]   They're selling Microsoft.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.320]   They're selling solutions and empowerment.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.320]   You can't even tell what they're selling.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.760]   That's true with all of this corporate stuff.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.280]   You can never tell what it is.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.280]   I used to do corporate stuff.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280]   It's bad.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.280]   I know it's corporate, Tom.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.280]   All right.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, I'm.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.040]   You guys get into a slap fight later when you do your show?
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.000]   We don't slap John.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.840]   When it comes to fistic us, we form the fifth.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.440]   I was thinking maybe you could wear later hoes and then slap each other.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.080]   Is that a fantasy of yours?
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.240]   My wife would do it, but you guys will.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.800]   That's what the fish, right?
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.360]   Dane didn't tell you.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:21.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to apologize and I hope you'll come back next week.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.520]   This is as good as it gets.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.000]   By the way, just a little shout out because in fact, I invite.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.560]   Why doesn't CNET do a team?
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.960]   We're going to do laser tag on Labor Day.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.760]   I'll be a dragon con.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.240]   That's a problem con.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.320]   All you guys are sci-fi guys, so that's why.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.680]   We're doing it at Hoonipa Rose Sarah Park.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.680]   You can join the Twit team.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.160]   In fact, if you don't want, we have a Twit team, but apparently we're the only team.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.000]   So it's not going to be much of a battle, but they've got these really cool laser rifles
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.600]   that are 200 yards accurate to 200 yards.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.800]   Can you blind someone?
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.800]   No, it's infrared.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.800]   It's infrared.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.800]   It's infrared.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.240]   Where's the fun without the sort of casualty in the game?
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.040]   Well, you can stumble over a log.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.040]   It's in the woods.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040]   Now, what is this all about?
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.040]   You're going to do this when?
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.040]   It's the Flazertag.org.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.080]   It's the .com wars.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.800]   It's a laser tag party.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.800]   Fun crunch and ziggy.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:13.320]   You're putting it together.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.320]   In San Francisco?
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.240]   It's in Hoonipa Rose Sarah Park.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.520]   Well, you mean why the bridge is close to an opening from the East Bay can possibly go
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.520]   to this thing?
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.520]   Well, that's right.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.520]   Labor Day, the close of the bridge.
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:25.360]   You go across the southern bridge and I'll say that.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.360]   That's convenient.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.360]   Of course, nobody will be taken.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.280]   No, it's on the southern end of the city.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.560]   It's like just right above SFO.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.520]   How would you get to the airport the same way?
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.840]   Actually, no, Sam Mateo is about the same distance.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.440]   Yeah, I think it's about from SFO.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.440]   Yeah, you don't have to go across town.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440]   So it's in San Bruno.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.440]   It's in San Bruno.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.440]   Easy.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.160]   None of these people outside of California know what we're talking about.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.280]   I know and they don't care either, but I just want to tell you, you can play against
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.280]   us.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.200]   If you're Google or Apple, I want to see a Google or Apple team.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:56.680]   $52 per participant includes a rental and a delicious lunch or $15 if you just want
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.120]   to watch and have lunch.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   Sflazertag.org.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:04.600]   I'm just wondering why they didn't go with Paintball.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:06.440]   Because it hurts when you get hit.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.320]   That's half the fun.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.680]   Should we do a Paintball War?
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.280]   Without the welts to kind of show off your battle scars.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.280]   You really wouldn't be sure.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.760]   There's still a live ammo.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.480]   Callie would probably mop the four of you guys.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.240]   Colleen is a Paintball wizard.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.920]   She's designed her own guns and everything.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.920]   She's going to be our general.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.920]   No, I'm general.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.440]   No, no, no.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.640]   We have wireless com sets.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.240]   It's going to be a brutal route.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.240]   Nerdfest.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.240]   Nerdfest.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.240]   Nerdal art.
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.240]   Nerdal art.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.200]   John C. Devorak is at Channel Devorak.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.720]   He does all these great podcasts.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720]   Tech five, no agenda.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.720]   Cranky geeks.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:39.720]   Twit.
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.720]   Twit?
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.720]   Twit?
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.720]   Twit.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:43.720]   Yeah, let's not forget Twit.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:44.720]   I've heard he's been on that.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.560]   You can find out more at channeldevorak.com.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.560]   Thank you, John, for being here.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.560]   Appreciate it.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:52.320]   And for bringing out some of the memorabilia, that's kind of cool.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.320]   Yes.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:57.520]   Maybe the Swedish laser tag team will show up and kick my butt.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.360]   You've got a motivation.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.040]   You mocked us and now if you're going to hurt you.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.040]   They all have like the Volvo.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.840]   We come from Nokia and now it's time to die.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.840]   Nokia's finished.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.840]   I know, I know.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.840]   Don't finish.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.200]   I marked the fins as well.
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.800]   Can you do a Norwegian accent?
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.800]   It sounds exactly like this.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800]   Not a Danish.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.960]   Actually, you say welcome to IKEA in that voice.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.600]   Come to IKEA.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.240]   Yes, that's what we need.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.240]   Ethnic humor.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.240]   I tell you.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.240]   It's so cheap.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.240]   It's not the mic.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.240]   It's not the mic.
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.240]   It's not the mic.
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:34.240]   It's not the mic.

[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.240]   It's not the mic.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.240]   It's not the mic.
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.240]   It's not the mic.
