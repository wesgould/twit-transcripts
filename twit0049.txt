[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   This is Twit. This Week in Tech. Episode 49 for April 9th, 2006. Mind the lag.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.120]   bandwidth for the Twit.tv network is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.800]   Let me introduce the Twits ladies and gentlemen starting with John C. Devorak.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.880]   Hello. John is visiting us from beautiful Berkeley, California. You call your home Berkeley or Oakland
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.120]   or Albany? It depends. Nobody knows where Albany is, so it's Berkeley. He's just I just think he's
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.040]   right across the road from the racetrack. Just think of it that way. On the other side of the
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.680]   racetrack, John C. Devorak, Kevin Rose is also here. Mr. Dig. Hello. Hello. Yes. From my apartment
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.440]   in San Francisco. Any racetracks near you? None. Also, a couple of new faces on this week in Tech.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.520]   This week. Actually, Molly's not new. Molly was on our show when we were at the Apple Store. We're
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.960]   glad to have Molly Woodbeck from CNET's Buzz Out Loud. Hello, Molly. Hello. I am in lovely Oakland.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.840]   As long as we're doing hometown. We should. I think that's kind of fun. I'm in Petaluma,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.440]   California, Northern California, and we have a visitor from the mysterious Redmond,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.000]   Washington. Are you in Redmond, Robert, or Seattle proper? I'm actually in Bothell, Washington,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.240]   which is about 20 minutes from Redmond. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Scoble,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.160]   the world's most famous blogger, the creator of the Scobelizer blog. He's awesome. It must be true
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.440]   if Leah says it. All the author of a new book called Naked Conversations with Shell Israel,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.800]   and his day job is working for Microsoft Corporation, where he, among other things,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.960]   the channel line, which is really a great site. We were just talking off the air about the number
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.560]   of visitors. You said you have over three and a half million unique visitors a month's channel line?
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.560]   Yep. And it's going up by about 10% a month right now. That's just remarkable.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.240]   If I could get on dig, it would go up even faster. Hey, I've seen channel 9 on dig a couple times.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.040]   Yeah, it has been. They dug channel 10. I know. Every time I'm on dig,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.880]   my traffic just goes crazy. That's awesome. Tell us about channel 10 because that's just launched.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.600]   On 10.net. And that's a news show where we hired two people from G4 TV, I think, tech TV.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.440]   That's right. Tina Wood. Tina Wood and Laura Foy. And they're going around and interviewing
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.360]   people about how they use technology. It's a show for enthusiasts where channel 9 is more about
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   behind the scenes at Microsoft and getting into people's offices and see what they're building
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.720]   and stuff like that. We sometimes get accused of doing too many Apple stories, but of course,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.960]   the big story this week is an Apple story. But just in honor of Robert, we're going to do a
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.920]   couple of Microsoft stories to lead off just to prove everybody wrong. Actually, I was excited
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.680]   about this story and it turned out to be not so Bill Gates doing a guest appearance in Dr. Who.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.320]   But not true. What a letdown. Yeah, I don't think that one's true. Bill does a lot of fun things,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.080]   though. He was in Frazier. I mean, he did in 2001, he did a cameo on Frazier. The thing that
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.640]   probably was the giveaway was in the original story was when they said that Gates would play an alien
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.720]   whose goal was total world domination. See, I don't see Bill doing that.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.320]   Yeah, well, maybe. I mean, you should see some of the funny videos they do internally for employees
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.240]   to see. He got together with the guy who does Napoleon Dynamite. I forget what the actor's name is,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.080]   but they did a fun. A fun skit. Let's get for the employee meeting. That was fun.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.000]   Oh, I would like to see that. I saw that. I actually think they posted that online, right?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.040]   Didn't that leak out somewhere? They posted some of it, but they did some other stuff that just
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.080]   was shown internally. So if I go search YouTube for Bill Gates, I'm not going to find it.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.200]   Probably not. I'm not sure. They usually don't share those because they only pay the actor
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.360]   small group sharing and not internet sharing. Well, wait a minute. Here is a five minute
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.480]   30 for that. Here's a five and a half minute clip. Bill Gates goes to college with a,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.240]   how long was the original clip? Yeah, that was about it. I think it's all. Oh, here's Bill.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.280]   He's got a vote for Pedro T-shirt on. Well, that's, I'm sure it'll be off YouTube by the time it
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.520]   looks like somebody had a camcorder in the, in the conference because I could see people's heads.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.080]   So this is one of those pirate videos that you would buy on the street corner in Taipei.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.000]   And, but that looks good. That's pretty funny. I want to watch that after the show.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.600]   They used to make great videos for a C or a convex. I mean, I remember the one where he and
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.560]   Ballmer brought me around in a Volkswagen bug, the dot, dot, dot, and they find a sun server by
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.480]   the side of the road, the throw in the back seat. And it starts to stink up the car. So they put
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.600]   him back on the road. Did they, did they stop doing that? No, they still do that kind of stuff.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.480]   Mostly for conferences like CES and convex. The problem is they, they blank out those areas.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.200]   You know, if you're there in the audience, you see them. But if you're watching at home on the,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   on the internet, they blank those out because again, they, they pay the actors, you know, one
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.760]   time rights and they don't want to put all over the internet. Some of the funniest stuff I've ever
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   seen. I think it's great that, that Bill has that kind of sense of humor in there. There's
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.200]   somebody there. Yeah. I think, I think by far the best appearance that I've seen is the,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.840]   the one on the Simpsons. Was that? By amount boys. Yeah. Was that his voice? Episode.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.560]   He is listed as having appeared on the Simpsons. Anyway, he's not doing Dr. Who. So we can move
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.920]   on to the other Microsoft news, which is of course, maybe a big, I don't know, now that it's
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.480]   happened, I think kind of a yawn in some ways, Microsoft bootcamp. John, what do you, what do you
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.680]   think about this? Windows on a Mac? Officially? I think the thing is that just they're just testing
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.480]   the water. I don't think this is the big, the big choice that they may or may not make to, I mean,
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.200]   the two choices that they have ahead of them, which may need, need one, need one may happen. One
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.440]   is to potentially just roll out OS X and let anybody use it, sell it for $100 or whatever,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.120]   or the other thing is just go with Windows and start bundling it with the machine, maybe with
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.760]   or without OS X or maybe even giving up on OS X. You know, the thing is they put this out like this,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.200]   just to say, well, let's see what happens. And you know, it was just, we're not going to support it.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.320]   We're just throwing this out there. You know, it's like throwing the, you know, something against
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.800]   the wall to see if it sticks. That's, I think as far as I take it, I don't take this that seriously.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.760]   John, I got a lot of email from people say, see, de Vorek was right, Microsoft, Windows on the Mac.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   But this, you weren't saying that, that Apple was just going to put Windows on the Mac. You said
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.440]   they were going to ban an OS X. This is not necessarily that. You know, this, this whole thing,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.400]   stem from an email I got from somebody where I decided to take it to its logical end. I mean,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.480]   there's some business case for it. If you think about it, it's just to drop the entire OS X
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.960]   development and go with Windows and save all that money in development, causing hassles of the
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.040]   future. And they go off and do, you know, do what they do best, which is design cool looking
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.520]   hardware. Now that's not to say that the Mac OS X is in a better operating system.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.480]   One of the other things I presuppose if they were going to do this is that they'd have their own
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.400]   executive layer. There's no reason you can't run, even though, you know, people say, well, you know,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.200]   you're putting a crappy kernel in there and fit, you know, instead of the good one that they've got.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.000]   But the fact is all they really, the thing that's really appealing about the Mac OS X is the interface.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.280]   You could make an executive layer, put it right on top of Windows and you wouldn't even know the
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.760]   difference. Well, except for the performance and the security issues and all that.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.640]   Patrick Norton has entered the room, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.520]   Hey, Patrick, the performance is great on the money.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.000]   No, no, I mean, dropping an executive layer on top of Windows XP to make it look like OS X.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.200]   Robert Scobel, what do you think?
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.400]   Yeah, I disagree with.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.640]   Well, I disagree with the old executive layer.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.040]   I think Steve Jobs loves having control of the entire stack and loves having the ability to
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.600]   innovate and outrun Microsoft. And if he only put Windows on Mac,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:22.320]   he'd be stuck with Microsoft's long shipping cycles. And that would frustrate him more than
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.640]   waiting for IBM to ship a power PC chip for the portables, you know.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.680]   Kevin Rose, did you have you tried this bootcamp yet? Have you installed?
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.360]   Yeah, I did try and get it up and running actually.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.760]   No, but the magazine is installed in the labs.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.200]   Yeah, I just got one of the new MacBook Pros. And so I ran it.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.800]   You know, I went through the installation process. I did the firmware update for the
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   for the laptop itself. And then it actually corrupted the partition.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.400]   And it was nice enough to tell me to put the original OS X disk back in reboot,
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.520]   go in and choose repair the partition and repair it within, you know, 30, 45 seconds.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.920]   But I was unable to get it up and running.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.120]   It's very, very, it's definitely beta software. There's no doubt about that.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.120]   Oh, wait, are you saying it interrupted your partition or that your partition was already
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.040]   corrupted when bootcamp went to write to it?
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.800]   No, it wasn't already corrupted. It was fine.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.000]   I tried it again after I repaired it and it still didn't work.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.440]   But it was trying to create a new space for the Windows partition.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.320]   Yeah, it was.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.000]   And that's when it kind of hung up.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.440]   When I went to do that, it told me that it did a disk verification.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.480]   Instead of it was a problem, I repaired it using the install disk.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.880]   And then the installation was flawless.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.680]   Yeah, I had the same issue. I was unable to make a partition.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.120]   I mean, this is a tough thing to do to do a non-destructive partition on Mac.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.240]   I suspect nobody's this is the first time I know of anybody's done it well.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.720]   I had the same problem. But what I did is I backed up my driver, reinstalled OS 10,
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.480]   you know, format of the driver, reinstalled OS 10.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.000]   And then it went flawlessly for me.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.400]   And it's running great. What do you think, Patrick, have you been playing with it?
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.520]   It's creepy.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.800]   That was the thing that kind of struck me.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.440]   Because it's an Apple sanctioned.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.800]   And it's a classic, you know, it's like you downloaded it.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.560]   It creates a driver disk for you.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.480]   You partitions it for you.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.040]   And then you restart and you load the OS.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.800]   And I thought that was kind of fascinating.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.600]   You know, the other thing doesn't make you feel a little sad, though.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.520]   You got this beautiful MacBook Pro.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.960]   And then all of a sudden you look up and you just rebooted out of this beautiful
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.920]   Aqua interface.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.760]   And then all of a sudden you're stuck with Windows XP.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.400]   Yeah, I mean, that was the creepy part.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.440]   I think it was really sad. I just, that's the part I thought was creepy.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.200]   Well, believe it or not, I'm going to defend it.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   It looked so wrong and yet so right.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.960]   It's not why Apple wants to do this so that you install XP on it.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.320]   And you, you know, like for instance, my wife is looking at buying a laptop right now.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.960]   And she needs to run Windows because of her work.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.600]   And so now all of a sudden Apple is on the board for her and she can buy a Macintosh.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.840]   And she can try out though, what's 10 then.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.520]   And maybe she likes it better.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.600]   And all of a sudden she's an Apple fan where she wouldn't even be able to buy an Apple machine before.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.960]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.160]   I think that's one of the bad things of it.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.520]   I would love for Apple to be the company that lets you install either Windows,
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.040]   iOS 10 or Linux. And actually, buy Macs pre-installed with any OS you want.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   I think that would, you know, then it's all about selling that great hardware that everybody's
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.760]   so attracted to. And then they can get away with charging a premium for it.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.160]   I don't know.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.960]   Do you really think that Apple's long-term goal here is to have a multi-boot system?
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.880]   Or is it really to kind of integrate that OS into OS 10?
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.760]   So in the future in 10.5, if there's a Windows app that you need,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.400]   you won't actually reboot, but you just launch it from the dock.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.720]   It'll start up the Windows environment and then launch it directly within OS 10 itself.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.640]   I've heard it talk to so many actual real-life Apple users who have been like
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.040]   looking at the parallels virtualization software. All they want to do is be able to run one or two
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.320]   Microsoft applications or to be able to verify that an application they're working on runs in
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.840]   there. And that's what I hear over and over again. They're like, this is cool and this will solve
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.160]   problems for some people. But most people, they either want a VM style software and they want
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.920]   it cheap like that Russian company's making it. Or they want just the ability to do a wine style.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.680]   I can run this, this, and this application if I need to. For email applications or weird corporate
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.440]   databases or whatever's lingering around there. That's true. Our Mac group at Microsoft is working
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.960]   on virtual PC for the Mac. And the next version, if they can get it all running, should run a lot
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.680]   faster because on current Mac are on the old Mac processors, they had to do emulation.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.000]   On the Intel processors, they won't need to do emulation. They'll be able to go native right to
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.880]   the hardware. So you should get pretty good performance. But they still, even on virtual PC on the Mac
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.680]   and the other kinds of products that do that limit their hardware to a subset of the hardware
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:46.320]   that is currently available. So things like games might not run best on it. Or things like Second
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.200]   Life might not run best on it. Although Second Life is already on the Mac. But things like that,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.000]   you might still want to do the dual boot and run natively in Windows.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.280]   Well, I have to say a couple of things about that. First of all, we have Will Harris on the line.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:12.000]   He is with bit-tech.net, the fabulous British enthusiast website. And that was exactly what
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.840]   struck him was that Conro and the later Intel chips will allow virtualization in hardware.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.720]   Well, the issue is that you're trying to run the two things off of one CPU. And so
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.600]   you're getting both operating systems running simultaneously, but they're both
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.800]   cloring for the CPU cycles. And so performance is not as good as if you were running it using boot
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.640]   camp, just the one operating system on the one CPU. And what's interesting is that Intel's
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.240]   next generation CPU technology. And in fact, some of the processors that are in the top end
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:53.040]   now in the PC space have virtualization built right in at the chip level. And so it can basically
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:59.840]   assign one operating system to one core of a dual core system, which will allow absolutely
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.640]   native performance rather than having an overhead of running the two simultaneously. You're going
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:13.120]   to get far better speeds. Which chip family is this? So it'll be the brand new, the Conro and
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.360]   Merom chips will have that built into the next generation corduro chips. And also the very,
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.960]   very top end Pentium 4 chips that you can buy now have it. But obviously the Pentium 4s aren't
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.880]   making their ways into into Macs at all. It sounds like that's something parallels will be very
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.360]   happy about. Well, I'm sure they will be. But it's interesting because Microsoft, of course,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.680]   has its own virtualization product called a virtual PC, which has been available on the Mac
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:50.960]   for a number of years now, which has offered kind of rubbishy performance for emulation. And of
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.680]   course, the issue there has always traditionally been that power PC wasn't very great at emulating
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.440]   x86 stuff in the window space. But there's been a lot of talk about all sort of rumors and
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:07.120]   speculation that Apple and Microsoft are working more closely together and that we will see a
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:15.440]   properly native version of virtual PC from Microsoft that could do as much as parallels does now,
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:22.480]   or possibly even more using the Intel technology as well. And so that's something that Microsoft
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.960]   has committed to developing virtual PC as they go forward. And we haven't heard anything out of
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.360]   them for a while. So I just wonder if they're just sitting on, if they're just sitting on this
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.960]   technology and they're waiting for the fraud over boot camp to die down and they can unveil
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.200]   something even better maybe. Well, you have to think that they were involved in some way,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:46.000]   helping boot camp work at least to allow the patch to the BIOS or the EFI BIOS so that it could
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.960]   boot Windows. I would imagine Microsoft was cooperating at least unofficially their sub-rosa.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.440]   So this is yeah, I would say that this is probably something Microsoft would like to do.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:02.720]   It certainly sells copies of Windows. That's true. It's just the virtualization usually is built to a
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.480]   subset of the hardware and as time goes along new hardware comes out like a new video card might
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.680]   come out in the next Mac or on Windows you see innovation in the hardware on the video cards
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:23.840]   just is very dramatic. And so gamers and people who need that ultimate performance might have to
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.640]   wait a generation for it to catch up. John, you seem dismissive of the whole idea. You don't think
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:35.520]   parallelization is the holy grail here? No, I don't. I think that this is wishful thinking that
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   people are going to go, "Oh, there's a Mac interface. There's the Windows one. Oh, the Mac went so much
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:45.360]   better. I'd rather use a Mac." I think people are more practical in that they use what they use
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.960]   applications and the operating system in between comes and goes. You don't normally sit there looking
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.720]   at it or playing with it. Most of the time you're in some application like Word or you're doing some
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.400]   typing or you're doing some photo editing. You're not carrying that much about the cool interface
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.280]   that the operating system represents. And I think the other thing that I always, I don't know,
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.360]   maybe this is a long shot too and they'll get people thinking I'm just trying to get attention.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.800]   But I think the potential for Steve Jobs to take over Disney would just pretty much turn Apple over
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.600]   to people who are more practical. And if he goes to Disney, which I hope he does because I think it
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.720]   would improve a lot of things over there, I don't know whether to improve the morale but or improve
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.440]   the company, I think then this whole thing is an academic argument and Apple is just going to
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.640]   basically be another company selling Windows. I do have to agree that I think for most consumers
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:43.040]   the idea of bootcamp and the idea of dual booting isn't a solution that they're looking for. So
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.520]   for Mac users, existing Mac users, this is fantastic. If they want to play PC games,
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.480]   I doubt that it's going to lure many existing PC users who are looking into the holiday season
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.040]   going, I need a computer. What should I get into saying, yes, that should be a Mac.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.080]   Yeah, but you're thinking of like the 80% of the market rather than 10% of the market.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.600]   And if they can get another 10% of the market that with the tuples.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.600]   So for me, I'm saying that this is not a huge.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.400]   I disagree.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.240]   I mean, this increase kind of a move.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.840]   Just on my wife's experience, I disagree. It's made her consider a Mac all of a sudden
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.880]   where she wouldn't even have been able to buy a Mac before.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.040]   I think what it really is is that there are people who want to get Macs and they need some sort of
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.560]   safety valve so that if you know it's okay to buy a Mac, well it runs Windows. So it's
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.840]   okay to buy a Mac. I'm going to use the Mac and Windows to edit this
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.800]   to it, for instance, I'm going to use Audition because Audition is one of the few programs I still
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.200]   really need Windows for and I'm going to boot into Windows and do it. But virtualization would
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.720]   be so great if I could run Audition in the Mac interface.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.120]   I think you will have a small number of people who maybe used to use Macs, felt really loyal,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.360]   moved over to Windows because whatever they had to use PCs at work, who then can make that switch
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.040]   back. But I suspect that you would have a much harder sell with die hard Windows users or people
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.480]   who are just literally too afraid to try to learn something new because you are saying,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.320]   well it does run Windows but it doesn't have to all the time. It's a slightly difficult sell for
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.560]   your average mainstream users. So that's why I don't think it's a huge market shared jump.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:21.840]   I think in 10.5 if you can say to a consumer, if you can say go to the software aisle of CompUSA,
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.400]   pick out any title you want, throw it into your Mac and you don't have to think about that. You
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.160]   double click the setup.exe and it just goes. That's a big sell.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.480]   No kidding, that would be fantastic.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.800]   That's a big win for Apple if they can make it that easy.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.040]   Has anybody tried this parallel software?
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.360]   It's not that easy to run it because you still have to boot into one OS or the other.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.800]   I'm actually downloading it.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.960]   I'm saying if they integrate it directly into 10.5.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.880]   I'm actually downloading it and then installing it in another room in the house.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.160]   So I was hoping to finish that before we started the Twit.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.720]   Yeah, I also have downloaded it but I'm a little nervous about using it but I think it's
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.200]   I mean obviously everything we're using here is very beta. Wouldn't you though have to buy a
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.360]   copy, Kevin, buy a copy of Windows to do that scenario that you were talking about when you
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.520]   have to have Windows as well as Leopard?
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.000]   Oh, they definitely have to bundle it with the Mac that you're buying.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.680]   You'd get an OEM package of Windows when you buy your new Mac and just be sitting in there,
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.360]   but they'd already have it integrated and where it would be one of those things where
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.880]   you wouldn't see it happening but if you clicked launch a Windows application behind the scenes
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.520]   it would have to load the Porsche in the OS or load the OS.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.240]   I mean it would be really nasty and slow. I don't know if it's really that feasible but
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.400]   Well, I don't think it's the point of virtualization. It doesn't have to be nasty and slow. You're using
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:38.960]   Conro. You take, as Will said, you know you take one processor and assign it to Windows,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.400]   one processor assign it to Mac that doesn't, I don't think it has to be nasty and slow.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.440]   I think it could actually be full, close to full speed.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.040]   I hope they do bundle it with the Macintosh because in order to do this I went out and bought
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.800]   a copy of Windows and I am still in sticker shock. Now I know why Bill Gates is the richest man in
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:04.160]   the world. Anybody want to venture how much? 300. 300 bucks. $300 for a shrink wrapped
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.800]   XP professional. I practically passed out. Oh I know some stories you can buy them online,
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.360]   just get them OEM. You can just buy a mouse with it. You can blame Steve Ballmer for those prices.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   Don't you think it's a slippery slope? Everything they've done so first they go to Intel. Now they're
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.920]   testing using Windows on the machine. Then you want it bundled. I mean the next thing you might
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.560]   as well just kiss off the whole Macintosh world. No John what I'm doing is I'm agreeing with
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.520]   you. What I'm saying is that users don't care about an operating system. They just want to run
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.000]   applications. Frankly if I could buy an operating system that was nice, efficient, secure, reliable
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.520]   and ran all the applications on the store shelves, that's a win. That's a big win for a consumer.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:48.800]   I don't want to be the one to say this but isn't that Windows? Yeah Windows. How many versions of
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.880]   OS 10 have you purchased that cost $129 each? Yeah well you're right in a way that's a good
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.840]   point. I mean if you bought Tiger and you bought Panther and you're going to buy leopard you spent
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.520]   well over 300 bucks. They can't sell for these ridiculous prices. Yeah it would be bundled.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.560]   Yes but in small doses. That's right it was a I'll tell you lane them I credit cut it after
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.360]   text. Unfortunately not that many people buy Windows at the $400 price or the $300 price.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.280]   Only me apparently. Yeah when the OEM buys a copy of Windows they don't pay $300. So that's why
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.720]   you know most people buy it right when they buy their machine. You know they get a machine with
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.880]   XP on it or Windows Vista on it. You guys are not making me feel better. I mean basically.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.040]   That one copy of Windows will last you a little longer than a copy of OS 10 before you have to pay
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.440]   another $129. Our service packs are all free. We didn't get you on last week Robert when we
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   wanted to talk about Windows Vista. Well Microsoft Windows Vista slipping. Now are you still the
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:52.320]   one of the product managers for Windows Vista? No. I'm in the evangelism group so I'm
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.880]   paid to help developers build software for the next version of Windows. All right so do you have
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:03.520]   any comment you'd like to make over the long delayed Vista? Yeah I've been walking around since I
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.160]   found out a week and a half ago about the delay. I've been walking around interviewing people and
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:15.040]   asking why do things slips and it's just quality. They show me the graphs of where the bugs are and
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.840]   you know what the overall impression of the quality builds are and it wasn't there and they
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.440]   said there's no way we can ship it in August. For the OEMs we need to let the OEMs have two months
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.040]   between the time we hand the disc to them with the final build and the time that you can buy it on
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.760]   the store shell. So the previous schedule was August and now it's been moved to November I think.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:44.560]   And that was just not enough time for the most of the OEMs to get machines onto the store shelf so
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.400]   consumers are going to be able to buy it in January I guess according to the current schedule
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:57.280]   and I ain't making any bets on it anymore. I've been burned with shipping dates not just in
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.680]   Microsoft right? I worked at other software shops and we'd you know even at a small eight person
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:07.360]   company we'd slip shipping dates. Robert X. Kringley had a really interesting theory in which he said
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.920]   that what happened was nobody at Microsoft was paying attention to the OEM you know released
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.800]   to master date and when they finally realized that oh we need to have it by July and August
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:22.320]   somebody said no you we can't and that's when it all you know went to hell. Obviously Microsoft
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.160]   is probably more attention. I mean I've been on beta since Windows 95 and that has always been
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.640]   true that you need two months between the time the gold disc goes to the manufacturers and the
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.800]   time it shows up on the store shelves. How much of a problem do you think it'll actually be for PC
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.440]   makers? It costs us a lot of all of these. I think it's it's already the problem is people are waiting
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.720]   you know and trying to hold off their purchases even my wife was trying to hold off her you know
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.960]   her purchase but she just can't anymore she's heard machines this so bad but she wanted to hold
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.720]   off until Windows Vista came on the machine you know and now HP at the set that's by it has
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.960]   little stickers it says Windows Vista capable on the machines. Those are great fun. You know oh
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:13.440]   Alex one piece of advice to her my recommendation by the machine with Windows Vista on it because
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.720]   if you have to pay the sticker price for it you're gonna just die. I got a little cheaper version
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.360]   you should come up in the visit me in Seattle and stay in my house and we'll go to the company store
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.800]   you won't pay 300 bucks. I knew I screwed up when I was paying for that I thought oh this is terrible.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.120]   Is that an offer you can open to all Twit listeners? Yeah they'll be up here tomorrow.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.480]   I have a thousand dollars I can spend in the company store so I can take a few.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.400]   How much is Windows in the company store is out of curiosity? About 60 bucks.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   Still kind of high. This should be $49.95 in Costco.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.280]   Jeez now I know I bill Gates and Eric Spolke. Oh man yeah you have to buy six of them but that's
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.360]   okay because you know you just give them to your friends. It's all right. Another big story at
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:09.840]   least for podcasters forester research announcing nobody listens to podcasts there's no business
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:16.080]   model just pack it in and forget it. What do you think Molly should we should we should we give up?
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.040]   Beautiful crew. I'm gonna have to hang up now because apparently this is a total waste of my time.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:27.360]   Nobody's actually listening and. No I mean I think that is you know obviously it's it is as if
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:34.480]   forester research was writing this about blogs five years ago. Obviously people it's not podcasting
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.640]   the FAD it's podcasting the dissemination of audio and obviously people have been consuming
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.120]   audio for a long time and will continue to do so in a lot of different ways. Charlene Lee who wrote
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.920]   this report for Forester and I actually have the full report that was that people spend good money
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.000]   for says that one quarter of online consumers are interested in podcasting but only one percent of
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.840]   all North American online consumers currently use podcasts whatever that means on a regular basis
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.240]   with another two percent that have tried them but don't use them regularly she sounds like she's
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.400]   talking about headache tablets. I'm not sure if this is even about podcast. She sounds like she
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   was writing about the web in 1995. Yeah I yeah I think it's exactly Molly's point she says yeah
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.520]   exactly. Podcaster users podcast users skew young and male well we I think that's true
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.360]   and rank among the technologically. Well and the other thing she says is that the only successful
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:34.240]   podcasts are really just repackaged online repackaged existing material and she says if you're a
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:41.120]   company considering podcasting forget it don't create new podcasts just take existing material and
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.560]   put it on the net. Bizarre. And she's completely ignoring it as a communications tool for you
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   know companies and and individuals. Executives don't get small things they don't get they don't
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.760]   understand analysts and other people they don't understand why you would talk to only four bloggers
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   but you guys should go and talk to a folder a new company that came out about a month ago
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:09.520]   and they talked to four bloggers and showed them their product and in 17 days more than a million
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.640]   people had signed up for their beta. Well so if I'm putting a podcast out there and the right
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:21.760]   four people are listening to it and like it. What does that lead to a million people listening to
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.680]   it within a month you know or that information getting passed along in Wall Street Journal or
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:34.000]   you know on Twitter or other places or on dig. You know it's a it's as a marketer you should be
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.640]   worrying about creating snow you know avalanches and you start avalanches with a snowflake at a time
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.280]   not a you don't create an avalanche just by saying there should be an avalanche you know.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.120]   Hey can we back up a second on this topic I think of something being overlooked here.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.240]   One of the things we we we don't want to ignore is the fact that researchers when something news
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.120]   coming down the pipe are notoriously inaccurate I mean we have to remember back when the PC
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.000]   junior was once predicted by at least two or three of these research companies to be the next big
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.080]   thing and they'll take over the market. Something like this coming around they don't know how to do
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.160]   the research right they don't know what questions to ask and they generally come up with the wrong
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.880]   answer until something's mature and then it's kind of easy to study when something's immature like
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.000]   this they're always going to get it wrong and they're really wrong on this one there's no question
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.280]   about it I think we all agree. We're also a blogger or I mean we're also all podcasters too.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.720]   I don't think that's the point and I also know that the kind of numbers I mean my blog gets
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:34.320]   gets notoriously more hits when I do the podcast I also have people coming up to me that saying
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.040]   oh I like the podcast I don't even know I write for PC magazine I think that there's a I think that
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.720]   there's an undercurrent here that's just completely ignored they just missed it let's face it they
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.760]   miss the whole mark and it's not that because we're podcasting. Yeah I kind of it's amazing
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.960]   yeah it's amazing that at this period in the development of the internet particularly
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.480]   analysts are still so willing and able to ignore kind of the effect of crowds and the wisdom of
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.920]   crowds and where people are congregating yeah and it's just as Robert said it's small groups at a time
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.920]   that grow quickly into large groups and I'm amazed that they still are ignoring that trend
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.840]   completely. Podcasting is what a year old I think getting 1% of the Americans to do anything in less
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.520]   than a year is a huge victory I mean that's 3 million people right. You know it's 53% of all
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:27.360]   internet subscribing households it's only 53% of all internet households that actually have a
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.360]   broadband connection. You know one of my friends does a show competitive two years and he started
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.480]   what eight months ago and today he's getting more than five million downloads a month so if there's
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.760]   only three million people out there listening that's I wonder what are they downloading a show
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.560]   twice you know. Well that actually is one thing that a lot of advertisers and people are claiming
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.840]   is that you can't count the downloads there's a lot of redown loads in fact Charlene Lee herself
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.320]   and her blog said well look I downloaded the same podcast twice once on each machine and
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.560]   that's her explanation of these so-called inflated numbers. Who are you talking about Chris Perrillo
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.040]   or who is it that's got five million a month. John Furrier of PodTech.net. Yeah he just got what
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.880]   five and a half million dollars what would he get a huge investment too. Yeah well he has a good
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.840]   show it's a lot of fun to listen to too. He started out by going around to Silicon Valley
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:24.320]   executives and engineers and interviewing them. So is that an editorial or an advertorial show?
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:31.600]   Editorial. Yep. They're not paying for placement on that show? No not not not today that I understand.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.360]   Oh I thought it was that's for some reason I thought it was like a Bontings window where they're
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.600]   paying to get on there. In fact that's why I thought he got the big investment well good for him.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.560]   No no no no I didn't pay to get on a show. You didn't get you did pay to get on this show either
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.640]   as a matter of fact. What is the cost by the way. Yeah you'll get the bill later you'll get the bill
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:55.040]   later. I'll pay you I'll pay you 50 Lending for it. Are you you must be a big second life for you.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.400]   This is the second time you mentioned second life here do you do you spend a lot of time in
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.200]   second life Robert. Actually my son is the big one he called me the other day from the Home Depot
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.440]   in second life. Oh you're kidding. I'm in the Home Depot in second life. I'm going I'm going what.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:16.480]   There's a Home Depot in second life. Can I get crazy. There's actually a friend of mine has added
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.960]   my buddy Phil from Make Magazine he asked me the day said can you give me a feed of the video of
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.520]   Ignatian that stays the same every week and I'm like what's up and he said well I'll put your
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.160]   video on display so people can come in sit down and watch it inside of second life.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.160]   Oh that's just bizarre. So there's like get togethers now. Somebody told me though that second
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.520]   life was very sexy was very adult oriented is that not the case. It is true there are adult
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:46.560]   areas in there there is a kid area which you can only get into if you're under 17 years old
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:54.240]   and that area is moderated and kept free of sex but the the regular old adult world you can tell
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.000]   when you're going into an adult area but it has its red light district just like real life does.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.160]   Yeah the suicide girls have their own little area over there. A friend of mine is wife works
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.640]   for second life. It's pretty crazy. They're doing really well and it's interesting because
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.400]   they've really got an economy. I mean if you go to the second life home page it says US dollars spent
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:23.120]   today 161,809 dollars and this is on a free program. I guess that money is is that real money or is that
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.160]   Linden doll? What was the deal on that? I don't understand that. That's real money. So like a
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:36.640]   week ago I gave my son $35 for his allowance build up and that turned into 10,000 Linden. So inside
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.960]   the game you have a currency called Linden and you can go into a clothing store, a virtual clothing
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.160]   store and if you have like a shirt or something it might cost 50 Linden and you right click on it
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:56.080]   and say buy it or whatever. There's music stores in there. You can buy physical objects too so if
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.520]   you want a home yeah you can. There's exchange businesses that will get you the dollars back out.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.720]   So what people are doing now is building homes and building objects in the game,
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:14.960]   building my son bought a samurai suit. I think he spent 300 Linden on that and so somebody created
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   a samurai suit that really is pretty interesting and artistic and it probably took him 20 hours to
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.320]   create it I don't know and he sells those suits and then you can buy the suit or you can buy the
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.480]   music. You can go into a music store, listen all sorts of different kinds of music and if you like
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:37.040]   one you just walk up to the wall and say bye and now you have that mp3 file to play for forever.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.760]   Why is it that's so? Are you sure you don't have an account there Robert?
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:50.480]   Oh I do. I do. I love just thinking that. In fact Microsoft bought an entire island and it's
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:56.960]   funding an island now so ericrice.com is building up some island with all sorts of fun things to
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:03.120]   do and hang out on and I think there's a conference center that's being built so you can go into 10
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:09.280]   conferences with other people in Second Life. He has a dance studio so you can go in and listen
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:13.440]   to different kinds of music and watch different kinds of videos and dance with your friends and
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:20.240]   you can buy dance animations for your avatar so you can be kept in the cool way. This is my kind of
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.680]   exercise. You never actually have to get up out of your chair to dance. In fact you could do this
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.400]   you know lying down you could do it in a vegetative state you know you just hook up the
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:36.960]   little solenoids in your head and you're set. Unbelievable. Why is it that Second Life succeeded
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:43.840]   where there did not? I think because you can create your own world. I don't know about the old one
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.760]   but you can create your own world and there's a business model. There's a way for you to create
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.560]   something you know you could create a building and then sell that building to other people who want
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.640]   that same style building on their worlds and you can create your own persona and walk around
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.440]   and see what other people have created and it's scalable thanks to the business model because
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:11.280]   when you buy an island actually what you're doing is buying a Linux server one Linux blade server
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:16.960]   in their rack. Oh interesting. So you pay 1,500 bucks a year for that and that Linux server is yours
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.320]   to build a world on and you know you can do whatever you want on it or you can sublease it out to other
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.520]   people and say you can buy an acre land you know for let's say 400 linden or something like that
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.040]   and then they can build something on that land. You know I'm looking at Second Life right now.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.840]   It's a pretty interesting world. And where you sign up you know you have to choose a first name
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:43.200]   but then you have a like a limited number of like 50 different last names is is there like a
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.360]   for a newbies in here is there a better. I see they have Dreben should I should I be Greg Dreben
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:53.680]   in Second Life is there a better last name? I don't know if there is actually Eric says that he can
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:59.040]   tell he can tell what when you came into the game based on your last name so he had sort of a list of
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:05.680]   last names and he knows sort of what time how how new you are based on your last name.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.600]   I'm signing up right now. Unfortunately there's already a Greg I'm on the page now too.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.840]   Everybody wants to I'm about to sign up as well. There's already a Greg Dreben unfortunately so
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.040]   I can't be Greg Dreben who was our old. I'm afraid to sign up because I don't think I can afford it.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:23.760]   It's free. It's free to walk it's free to walk around and find out. Pretty significant. I know.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.000]   It costs money once you get addicted to it. But it's not free to buy an island and that's all I want.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.240]   You don't need to buy an island. You can buy a house you know which my cost is 10 bucks.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.600]   The hard part is the time because it's like World of Warcraft or playing the Xbox.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.480]   To me it's a thousand hours that's just going to disappear from your life
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:49.040]   in the second world. I've already lost one family member to World of Warcraft. I don't think
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.360]   that I can be the next. I actually had to delete it off my hard drive because it was taking up so
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.400]   much time. I've just created my character and just in case you run into me my name is Pruneface
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:05.120]   Spatula. It's pretty good. I have the most evil and largest software company in Second Life.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.680]   I wonder where I got that idea. Is that your name? What's your name in Second Life?
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:14.880]   Scoble Seattle. You can't tell if that's my son or me because if my son's online it's him.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:21.280]   Well I'll give you a reference credit. But anyways if you come over to Eric Rice's
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:28.960]   Island which is called Flack Street you'll see my scobalyzer building. It's built on a bed of lava
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:34.560]   and it has a blood squirting fountain in the lobby. Oh that's lovely. John C. Devorek is this the
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:40.320]   kind of thing you would spend any time doing? I'd like to... What would John's name be in here?
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.400]   Greg Dravin of course that's me. I knew it. No I don't do it. You know the kids do this stuff.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.160]   I can't afford the time either. These things are... There's only so many hours in the day and I'm
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.960]   working on the blog and on this other stuff. Devorek.org/blog if you want to visit it I have to say.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:00.480]   Other than that you know I got other things to do. I got right for a living. I don't have time
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.720]   to sit around in these virtual worlds. John you haven't actually... Very expensive. You have a new
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.080]   enterprise you're working on. Is it... It looks like a message board. Is that what it is? What's going
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.240]   on? Yeah I'm playing around. Fortunately we're still working on the template because we just
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.160]   upgraded like within two days of putting it online and then they upgraded. It won't take the old
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:24.400]   template which is just a drag. But yeah I've got to... We have a lot of... We scroll a lot of stuff off
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.880]   the blog and people want to get into these debates so I decided to move them over to a message board
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:34.880]   called you know a simple machine forum called Kajimatch. So any time people... And we always see
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.480]   these two or three guys are arguing with each other. So we're going to push them over there
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:45.920]   and get them off the blog. Anyway I said kajimatch.devorek.org/kajimatch. I like the name. I think that's a
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.160]   good appropriate name really for message boards. Anybody who's spending time. There's an entire
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:56.560]   town in New Hampshire that created their town in Second Life to do disaster training and disaster
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.520]   drills to sort of plan out how to do things. How do the Mac and Windows clients compare? Are they
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:06.160]   pretty common? They're almost exactly the same. I can't tell much of a difference. I can't tell
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:11.040]   them. Do they have a universal binary? I don't know about that yet. I think they're working on a
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:16.240]   universal binary. I'm not sure. You can always tell who's got a MacBook Pro. I hate that I have to
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:22.720]   ask that all the time now. But is it universal binary? Why don't you have Kevin explain what a
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.720]   universal binary is because you guys keep saying it and people out there listening wondering what
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.520]   the heck is he talking about? Sure. So any application that was compiled for the old
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:38.320]   cell Mac which is the power PC processor needs to run in this through Rosetta which is a piece of
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:44.960]   software that will translate the code into native x86 based code that will run on the new Intel Mac.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:52.080]   So it's slower. So a good example is Photoshop. They don't have Photoshop that was
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:58.160]   it's not been compiled yet for the Intel based Mac. So if I launch Photoshop on my old G4 it would
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:04.240]   take 10, 12 seconds to launch. But it has to pass through Rosetta now on the Intel based Mac so it
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.360]   takes probably about I don't know 45 seconds or so to actually get up and functioning. Although we
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:16.560]   did a little some benchmarking of Photoshop running in Rosetta in emulation on a dual processor
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:22.720]   iMac and compared it to the single processor iMac that preceded it and it was actually faster. So
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.280]   yeah it's not running as fast as it could be running but it's but it's but it's still
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.920]   I think it's usable. Oh yeah it's definitely usable. No doubt about that. It just takes a while for it
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:37.760]   to kind of launch. I mean Firefox is another great example if you don't go and find like the alpha
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:44.720]   universal binary to launch it takes like I don't know seven or eight bounces and a good 10 seconds
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.200]   or so to actually load Firefox. But if I get the universal binary it's one bounce and it's
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   seriously under under half a second. Yeah I've noticed that's much faster if you can run Intel
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:01.040]   only really is fast. Pruneface spatula is now in second life so I'm going to go come visit you
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.880]   Robert and and beat you up okay. Sounds good. I'm looking for you scoble. I know you're there.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:12.000]   I'm looking for you. A couple other stories and we're going to wrap this rip this thing up here.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.920]   Find me it's actually my son so be nice to know. All right. I'll be nice to him. First of all
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:23.840]   Disney getting into the phone business a phone service with parents in mind. Disney's going to
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:30.080]   make a cell phone that you can block when the kid can use it. You can say what numbers they can
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.800]   dial. More importantly you can look on a website or look on your phone if you also are a Disney
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.200]   subscriber and you'll know exactly where your kid is at every moment of the day. John you want
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:45.280]   to get one of these for your kids? I don't think that kids need this kind of oversight
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.640]   personally. I think responsibility should be taught at an early age. We should tell people
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.400]   out there that we're using a new software package called Vintrilo. I was going to tell them that.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.880]   Probably one of the crappiest things that we've used on this podcast since we started it.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:04.560]   It's not we tried Vintrilo once before and I think you worked out. There's a lag time issue
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.840]   you should explain John. It's the lag. The quality is great. Quality is very good and
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.520]   we're going to keep using it probably in two-person chats where I will go. It will sound great once
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.480]   he edits us back into the order in which we should be speaking. Exactly. You just you guys you didn't
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.800]   have to say anything John. They wouldn't have even known you know. Well the thing is if this is
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.040]   supposed to be used by gamers so they can be online with each other I think they're going to get killed.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.680]   No it's just for it's just for issuing. I know. I think we should do something.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.720]   It's on the fly. We shouldn't. You guys all sound really clear and crisp but man this lag is weird.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.240]   Yeah we'll have to work on that. For those who are hearing the edited version
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:46.400]   we talk and then somebody else responds like three minutes later in a silly bizarre.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.760]   You know what I'll do is I'll put out two versions. I'll put out an unedited version so
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.280]   everybody can see how bad it was and then I'll put out an edited version which I'll probably have
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.600]   to get out in about three or four months because it's going to take me so long to get this thing
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:04.720]   posted but it'll sound great by the time I'm done. Don't do it to yourself Leo. Any other
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.600]   stories. I'm hearing by the way that Skype might have a just let it be for you and edited. Skype
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:14.720]   might actually have an ability to do groups like this and record them the podcasting coming out real
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.760]   soon. That's my rumor for the week and I can't tell you where I heard that rumor.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.960]   Well I wish they would because it's killing us. You know Skype has no latency. I mean it works
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:30.000]   really well. The quality isn't quite as good as this. I don't know. This is probably not going to
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.560]   sound all that good by the time I'm done processing it. So you know maybe we should have just
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.240]   maybe just let's just do it all over again. Everybody hang up we'll do it on Skype okay.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.560]   Sounds good. I have dinner reservations. That's just because nobody's listening. I heard
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.640]   Oh that's right it doesn't matter. Nobody's listening. I do want to thank you all for being here.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.520]   It's been it's really actually has been a lot of fun even with the lag. Molly would of course with
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:59.040]   CNET's Buzz Out Loud and you can hear it every single day and they have an actual recording studio
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:04.560]   and so they actually sound very very good. It is extremely fancy. We like it a lot. Yeah.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.840]   Let's see. Leftovers. And thanks for having me again. You're welcome Molly. Thanks for being back.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:13.520]   It's the leftover CNET radio studio which due to its unfortunate demise has been completely empty
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:18.400]   for the last couple of years. Also joining us this week Robert Scobble from Channel 9
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:24.320]   and Microsoft Company and I got to tell you the new book is really good. If you're interested in
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:30.480]   what it's all about in terms of corporate communication and blogging naked conversations
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:35.040]   Robert Scobble and Shell Israel it's in every bookstore. You did a great job. In fact I'd
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.320]   like to get you guys on Inside the Net. We can talk a little bit more about the book. Thanks for
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.800]   having me Leo. It's great having you. And next time we'll do this. Yeah Robert I saw a picture of you
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:48.160]   actually naked at this book signing. Was he naked? Well we're partially naked.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.880]   Yeah I could boom and I'll take off my shirt for a man to anytime.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:46:01.040]   Great. But we interviewed 188 businesses about how they use blogs and it was an interesting
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.320]   process to do that. In fact you did some of it online which is kind of neat. Kevin Rose is still
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:12.560]   a diggin. I take it you were recovered from the Yeagermeister episode. Yes we've learned
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:18.480]   our limits as far as drunken podcasts are concerned. So yeah there's that. I've been
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.600]   I thought it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it. You have to watch the Dig Nation episode where
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.160]   they're in Reno. How many shots did you take Kevin? Well the problem is you go to this thing
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:32.720]   and we did the live audience thing and there's you know there's a hundred or so people
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:37.680]   standing around watching the podcast and we drink beers during the podcast so they feel that we
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.960]   also need to drink shots and there's a table full of shots and then they start chanting like drink
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:49.280]   drink drink. It's like college days all over again and and so Alex actually got so sick.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.960]   He was in the bathroom like five minutes later hugging the toilet and it was really bad. He
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:00.560]   actually fell. The podcast ended. He stood up and he collapsed. He like passed out. I understand he
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:06.000]   actually was he was it was unable to move for a full 24 hours after doing that podcast. Kids
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   don't try this at home. That's correct. We were supposed to go snowboarding the next day.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.560]   No no I definitely I mean start with beer. That's good advice. Well my kids. Kevin Rose
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:24.160]   we've taught our kids how to find sex online. How to drink beer. What a role model. I love it.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.600]   Kevin with it's great having you. It's always good to talk. We'll promise you we won't do ventrilo
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:35.120]   again next time. We'll just do it like we didn't used to do it. Also Patrick Norton thank you for
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.840]   putting up with us. It's been good to talk to you. Things going well on dltv. Yeah it's
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:46.640]   it's been exciting. We're actually rebuilding our studio right now so it'll look less ugly which
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:53.280]   is a big plus and learning a lot about flash encoding and dot net actually. Oh interesting.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:00.080]   It's also the home for a john c dvorak's new video podcast which is cranky geeks at is it cranky geeks
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:05.680]   dot com john yeah cranky geeks dot com we're a bunch of cranky old men apparently. Hell he says
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:11.520]   what they tell us. So it's it's it's it's a good half hour for people who want to try to catch up with
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:17.360]   the you know whatever. It's good show. The thing is we do need to I would like to see it streamed
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:23.920]   in flash which I think is cool. Oh john you and I we can have a long conversation offline about
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:32.240]   flash community server mishandling of JavaScript and a number of other issues but we'll work on that
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:39.520]   and also be cost of flash which despite the reduction in the flash. Vig from Adobe. Well you know the one
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.240]   thing is still three and a half times as much as as regular streaming. Well that's too bad you know
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:50.640]   that one thing I was noticing I noticed you had a post today on the blog that from youtube and the
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:55.280]   thing just crapped out they couldn't even serve it anymore. I think those guys must be swamped.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.240]   They're back they were down there. I actually know a couple of the guys over there. Luckily they're
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:04.400]   struggling so hard. Yeah right. Yeah they got. Yeah they're really struggling to keep up with
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.280]   the growth right now. I was talking a couple guys over there and they're just so popular. They have
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.400]   over 500 servers. It's just insane. Yeah they got more money Molly but they're gonna spend it. I mean
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.680]   their burn rate must be huge. Yeah they have no they have no monetizing at all. I mean I guess
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.200]   they're gonna put ads on there but that's not gonna make any money. Yeah I don't think it'll save
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.720]   them for long. I think it'll just keep them up and running for another few months maybe without
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:32.400]   server crashes. Anyway I see it though just sell it to Yahoo for five billion dollars in the
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.760]   folder. Would you guys hear that? Was it Facebook or like walked away from a 750 million dollar
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.080]   haul? Yeah that's all they're waiting for. Yeah that is just insane. That's dumb. I cannot believe
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:49.280]   Facebook turned out. They wanted two billion I think it was. Oh please. Do's Corp saying there's
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.960]   no one. My favorite go for. About 500 million. I mean what was that one that years ago those guys
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.360]   did that point cast or whatever it was those guys got offered a bunch of money that would nothing zip.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.080]   Right. Well they sold for eight. What was it? They were offered a 150 or 200 and they sold for
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:09.200]   eight like 12 months later. Why don't you say goodbye Leo so we can get off this thing. All right I am.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.440]   I want to say goodbye. I want to thank our friends at AOL Radio who provide the bandwidth
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.480]   for this week in tech and thank all of you for joining us and thank ventrilo for absolutely
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:24.080]   nothing. We'll be back next week via Skype. Thank you everybody. Have a great today. Another
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:43.760]   tweet is in the can.
