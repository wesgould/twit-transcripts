[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.120]   so we're all tripping our eyes out.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.800]   But welcome.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.320]   No, that's not true.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.280]   From TMZ, Roberto Baldwin.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.920]   Hi, how are you?
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.880]   I have pictures of you.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.000]   Yeah, you have pictures of me?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.520]   I have pictures of everyone.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.240]   Senior editor in Gadget now.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.000]   He's turned to the dark side.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.200]   Actually, I for the-- you know, you've told me,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.960]   but I didn't put two and two together about the 30-mile zone.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.200]   But that's what TMZ stands for, 30-mile zone.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.720]   Yep.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.680]   I didn't even get that.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.480]   It took me years.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.360]   I still don't get that.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.960]   What does that mean?
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.680]   The 30-mile zone is there's a radius within Hollywood
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.600]   where, back in the olden days, you
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.640]   didn't have to get paid union workers a per diem.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.600]   If they went outside that zone, they got a per diem
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.960]   in addition to the regular pay.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.720]   But if they were inside that zone,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.400]   while they were working on TV shows or movies or whatever,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   they didn't get a per diem.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.920]   It also, though, was the informal agreement
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.320]   that this is within this zone.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.080]   Anything goes.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.600]   You're in the industry.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.640]   This is like what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.480]   That, by the way, is Alex Wilhelm from Mattermark.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.360]   Great to have you.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   Good to be back.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.120]   This is the young guy in this room here.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   And also joining us, Nathan Oliveris Giles,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.840]   who brought his Mac Pro.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.080]   He doesn't want to be separated from it ever again.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.800]   He's at the Wall Street.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.080]   In case his iPad Pro dies.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.160]   Oh, I love it so much.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.880]   Love it so much.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.480]   He's got an iPad Pro and a Mac Pro.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.640]   You must be a profession.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.640]   And the--
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.880]   And the Broadway ass case.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.880]   That is proof positive that Johnny
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.440]   Ive has been on sabbatical for at least three years.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.000]   Also joining us via Skype.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.520]   And I'm really glad to have him.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.200]   Elmer DeWitt.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.560]   He is the elder statesman of the Mac, a journalistic community.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.640]   He has his new website, PED30, which is a--
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.040]   I'm congratulations, by the way.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.360]   Wonderful site all about Macintosh after he left Fortune.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.720]   This is his thing.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.520]   And you were at the Apple event, were you not?
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.120]   I was guilty as charged.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.560]   The only amongst us.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.640]   Yesterday we had David Pogue on.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.480]   Really?
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.160]   Yeah, on the new screensavers.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.640]   And he actually, I think, did a fairly good job,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.600]   much better job than Phil Schiller of justifying
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.160]   the loss of the headphone port.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.840]   Courage was not the first thing that leapt to mind.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.080]   Here we are.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   On 9/11, the last thing you want to say is, oh,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.560]   it's a courageous thing to remove the headphone jack
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   when on this day 15 years ago some true courageous people.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.800]   You just totally ruined all the jokes
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.560]   we could have made about that.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.920]   I did that on purpose.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.440]   It's super serious.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.720]   That was in comedy like blocking right there.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.960]   I know I did that because I didn't
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.120]   want to have no cowardly lion stuff or any courage.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.280]   What does it take to take out a headphone jack?
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.240]   Courage.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.760]   Correct.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.200]   None of that.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.480]   I don't want any of that.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480]   So--
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.520]   You just have voice again before you move on.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.480]   That was really good.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.240]   If I were king of cappuccino--
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   You could sing them all due to dancing.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.160]   King of cappuccino.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.880]   Not oil.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.840]   All right.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.600]   Coverage.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.320]   That was so good.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.440]   So Philip, I didn't want to--
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.240]   I guess I led with the headphone jack,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.600]   but I guess for those of us going in,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.720]   we thought we'd knew everything about what Apple was going
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.120]   to announce.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.120]   There weren't any real surprises.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.800]   The headphone jack was the one thing, though, that many of us
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.400]   thought, they can't do that.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.040]   And then they did it.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.680]   Sure enough.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680]   What do you think?
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.400]   It's so weird.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.160]   Because anybody who was following this--
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.120]   not everybody-- but we knew about this.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.760]   So the first rumors of this surfaced
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.800]   at the end of November last year.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.560]   So we had 10 months of the people who follow Apple
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.200]   to kind of digest it.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.840]   And I mean, I went through my five stages of grief
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.240]   that first day.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.800]   So anger, denial.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.080]   You finally got to acceptance.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.920]   Bargaining.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   Bargaining.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.320]   It was weird because it surfaced in a Japanese blog
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.520]   that I'd never heard of.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.080]   And by the second or third derivative story,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.360]   it wasn't just a rumor.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   It had happened.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.920]   Apple had already eliminated the headphone jack.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.800]   And my piece said Apple would be crazy to do this.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.840]   And they're just crazy enough to do it.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.000]   And sure enough, they did.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.560]   But what's odd is to-- I was not surprised.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.200]   Was anybody here surprised that there wasn't a headphone jack?
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.040]   It was-- that was a done deal, right?
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.880]   It made sense.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.720]   It pretty much knew.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.320]   It made sense.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.680]   But my point is that then you turn on the nightly news.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.520]   And everybody's-- that's all anybody's talking about.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.440]   I mean, the general public found out something really
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.280]   surprising to them and shocking.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.600]   They didn't know ahead of time, you mean?
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.120]   Right.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.720]   And now, within a couple of days, we had--
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.800]   have you seen the college humor parody?
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.040]   Let me play a little bit of this.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.440]   It's pretty darn funny.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.040]   Most companies strive to make their products better.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.760]   But at Apple, we pride ourselves on thinking different.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.240]   That's why with the iPhone 7, we've
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.360]   done something that at first seems counterintuitive
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.960]   and then is--
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.560]   I think it's worse.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.080]   We removed the headphone jack.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.800]   And that's all.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.480]   That's the new.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.040]   That's the newness right there.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.920]   It's just the lack of a thing that was there.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.160]   And now it's not gone.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.520]   It's not there anymore.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.160]   Ta-da.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.480]   Anyway, it goes on.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.800]   And there's some profanity, as Tim Cook realizes,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.920]   all the downsides.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.000]   It's right.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.760]   Downside one, of course, you can't listen to music
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.040]   in charge at the same time without a $40 Belkin dongle.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.640]   Apple didn't even dane to make a dongle.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.920]   I'm supposed to say dongle out loud, not getting in trouble.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.360]   But I think to the Phillips point earlier about the mainstream
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.400]   people being confused, it shows the gap between our world
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.800]   and the rest of the world.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.040]   So we sit here and we talk about everything.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.920]   We knew it was going to happen.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.200]   We were prepared for this for my list.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.480]   I've been on several tweets now about this one headphone jack
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.160]   now post.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.400]   But everyone else was shocked to have read it,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.440]   even lost his mind over this.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.080]   And I'm like, where were you guys two months ago?
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.960]   But it turns out we were on a private island.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.280]   They were out in the real world.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.880]   And we were confused.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.240]   One of the things that really surprised me
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.480]   was how many people thought that Apple just basically
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.200]   is no longer going to include headphones with the phone
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.240]   since they announced their phones too.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.680]   Well, you don't need one too, because you don't have a headphone
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   check.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.240]   Well, we're still including the headphones that now plug
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.840]   into the lightning port jack.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.600]   And then also the $9 dongle that will do a conversion, which,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.440]   you know, I mean, I think what you should do
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.560]   is add to the price of your iPhone $100 for dongles.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.240]   And just buy 10 or 11 dongles, right?
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.840]   That's true.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.280]   And put them everywhere.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.560]   Put them in the house.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.160]   Put them-- if you like headphones, I love edomotics headphones.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.080]   They have this old-fashioned thing called a headphone jack.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   I'll just put a dongle on there.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.880]   And then I can use it with the lightning port.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.360]   But in the long run, Apple's real-- well, first of all,
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.280]   let me say what David said, which I think is somewhat legitimate,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.720]   which is every smartphone manufacturer
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.360]   would love to remove the headphone jack.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.680]   He says, that's a big piece of real estate inside the phone.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.600]   And if you could get rid of it, that
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.960]   would let you do a lot more things.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.840]   In Apple's case, it allowed them to do stereo speakers.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.680]   It allowed them to increase the battery by 14%.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.080]   It allowed them on the 7 Plus to put a dual camera in there.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.440]   It allowed them to put of dubious value, a haptic sensor
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.840]   for the home buttons.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.080]   They didn't have to have a physical home button.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.720]   They were able to do more because they had a lot more real estate.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.520]   He said, David said, you don't understand.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.760]   If you look at it, that thing takes up a lot of real estate.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.200]   Well, but the battery gains you get,
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.440]   you're going to lose them because you're using Bluetooth,
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.160]   which is just a battery that's not interesting.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.440]   So you're like, well, you get 14% more battery life.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.760]   Yeah, but 20%.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.400]   I'm going to lose 20% of my battery life
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.960]   because I'm using Bluetooth all the time.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.920]   So it's a negative.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.360]   Well, I should also point out that Apple's long-term intent
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.640]   doesn't seem to be for you to use wired headphones at all.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.840]   I mean, they're going to make some--
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.720]   is it coincidental that Apple also owns
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.200]   Beats, a headphone manufacturer?
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.080]   I would go and say no.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.280]   So the Beats is-- no one sells more Bluetooth headphones
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.080]   than Beats.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.400]   So there's the number one seller of Bluetooth headphones.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.440]   The new Solo 3s.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.320]   I love that you know that, though.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.080]   That's awesome.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.360]   All the factors to have.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.000]   Number one in Bluetooth headphones, boom.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.360]   They also will be making lightning jack a headless.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.520]   You have to wonder, though, if Apple's
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.480]   going to have the courage to put a lightning port on their laptops
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.320]   and take away the headphone jack there, too, I guess not.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.480]   So they're going to have the dual platform solution.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.240]   I don't understand.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.600]   USB-C, lightning, and nothing else.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.720]   I mean, could that be your words?
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.080]   But also creates this sort of divide between your computers--
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.760]   your iPhones are computer--
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.440]   and every other audio device on the planet.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   Right.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.960]   Like everything else on the planet
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.760]   uses MiniJack or quarter inch or XLR.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.920]   And then there's your computers, where you use something
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.680]   completely different.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.040]   So now you've created this divide between people who
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.400]   love music or musicians and computer users.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.960]   Like I'm a musician, so the idea that my next iPhone won't
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.040]   have a MiniJack is ridiculous.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.320]   I'm not going to buy another iPhone, which sucks,
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.040]   because I really like iOS 10.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.600]   I use Apple products.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.280]   But I'm like, you know what?
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.440]   I guess I'm going over to Android,
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.960]   because I need to plug it into things.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.160]   I need to be able to charge.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.280]   I need to be able to do stuff.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.080]   I need to be able to record things with it.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.960]   I need to be able to play music while we're practicing.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.920]   Like, oh, we got to figure out what this part is.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.960]   And I can't plug in a lightning jack
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.160]   or have to walk around with an adapter all the time
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.520]   to plug into our mixing board.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.480]   Phil Schuller--
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   Phil Schuller.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   Go ahead, Philip.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.960]   Well, I was going to say, that's why they still sell the iPhone
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.560]   6S, which is now $100 cheaper.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.960]   For all you losers who need headphones.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.160]   Right.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.440]   Until they run out.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.440]   It feels like a remedial phone, right?
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.520]   Oh, dude.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:56.280]   How many of you are already using wireless headphones?
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   Well, I broke my headphones.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:57.720]   Just that one.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.640]   My phone's jack on my phone, so I can't actually use wireless.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.480]   You're using the new phone for like six months.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.240]   Yeah, and it's kind of annoying.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.680]   I went out and I bought the old Beats, the Beats 2,
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.920]   because they were selling 100 bucks off at T-Mobile.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.600]   When I was returning my Note 7, I bought those.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.080]   And just to see, it is not a bad experience.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.160]   I mean, I'm not crazy about the Beats sound, particularly.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.160]   It does have its own sound.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.040]   It's got to kind of sound design for hip-hop.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.200]   But they didn't lose--
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.240]   they didn't drop.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.520]   You know, you can move around.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.240]   Apple says it's going to be even better with their new W1 chip.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.160]   Although, it's still Bluetooth.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.720]   It is still Bluetooth.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.840]   We've been able to verify John Gruber and others have verified
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.240]   that it will still be able to pair.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.000]   Any Bluetooth device will be able to pair.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.040]   It just won't have that automatic thing.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.240]   But by the way, Phil Schiller is not the first person
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.640]   to use the word "occourage" at Apple.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.760]   And this is what I think Phil was thinking about
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.600]   and referring to.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.720]   This is Steve Jobs at the All Things D some years ago.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.000]   Apple is a company that doesn't have the most resources
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   of everybody in the world.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.640]   And the way we've succeeded--
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.720]   By the way, this is before Apple was the largest, most
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.080]   successful company in history.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.720]   When you were with us in 2011, yeah, I think so.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.960]   It is by choosing what horses to ride really carefully,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.000]   technically.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.720]   We try to look for these technical vectors that
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.000]   have a future and that are headed up.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.680]   And technology, different pieces of technology,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.480]   kind of go in cycles.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   They have their springs and summers and autumns.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.840]   And then they go to the graveyard of technology.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.240]   And so we try to pick things that are in their springs.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.040]   And if you choose wisely, you can save yourself
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.560]   an enormous amount of work versus trying to do everything.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.880]   And you can really put energy into making those new emerging
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.920]   technologies be great on your platform,
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.800]   rather than just OK because you're spreading yourself too
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.560]   thin.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.440]   So we have a history of doing that.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   As an example, we went from the five-inch floppy disk
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.200]   to the three and a half-inch floppy disk with the Mac.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.160]   Before other people, right?
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.360]   We were the first to do that.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.520]   We made the three and a half-inch floppy disk popular.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.840]   Sony invented it, and we put it in the first products.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.600]   And there were some good reasons we did that.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.960]   So we got rid of the floppy disk altogether in 1998
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.600]   with the first iMac.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.800]   We also got rid of these things called serial and parallel ports.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.440]   And we were the first to adopt USB,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.520]   even though Intel had invented it.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.800]   You first saw it in mass on iMacs.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.960]   And so we have gotten rid of things.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.840]   We were one of the first to get rid of optical drives
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.520]   with the MacBook Air.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.120]   And I think things are moving in that direction as well.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.880]   And sometimes when we get rid of things
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.160]   like the floppy disk drive on the original iMac,
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.720]   people call us crazy.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.400]   Or at least premature, maybe.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.520]   No, they call us crazy.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:07.800]   And-- but sometimes you just have
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.520]   to pick the things that look like they're
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.480]   going to be the right horses to ride going forward.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.920]   What if people say, you know, the iPad
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.360]   is crippled in this respect?
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:19.880]   Well, you know what?
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.640]   I'd say two things.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.600]   Number one, things are packages.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.240]   I should have queued this up to the courage.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   Some things are emphasized.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.800]   But we're going to take the heat,
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.280]   because we want to make the best product in the world
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.240]   for customers.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.000]   Let me queue this up to the--
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.400]   It's a great clip.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.160]   And--
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.920]   Well, you see, by the way, when you watch this,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.200]   you see why Steve Jobs is so good at what he does.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.520]   And Phil Schiller is--
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.920]   if Phil had explained it this way,
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.520]   maybe we would be a little less--
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.160]   It was the word "courage."
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.680]   Well, here's how Steve used it.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.920]   We're making the wrong choices.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.200]   We listened to the market.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.880]   We're just people running this company.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.440]   We're trying to make great products for people.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.760]   And so we have at least the courage of our convictions
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.280]   to say, we don't think this is part of what
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.200]   makes a great product.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.520]   We're going to leave it out.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.000]   That's the courage of our convictions,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.640]   as opposed to Phil Schiller's courage, which
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.800]   isn't the same thing at all.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.520]   It's a different concept.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.520]   It's a different concept.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.520]   It's a different concept.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.960]   We have the courage of our convictions to move forward
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.720]   and to remove these nearly antiquated tech products.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.640]   But let me ask you, is the headphone jack one of those?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.120]   I mean--
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.080]   We're going to find out.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.840]   We're going to find out if other headphone--
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.320]   if other manufacturers remove the headphone jack,
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.320]   Apple will have been proved right.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.880]   And if nobody buys the iPhone 7 because it doesn't
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.880]   have a headphone jack and they could
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.120]   be proved wrong.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.520]   Let me make somebody tweet it at me.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.240]   If Apple had sold the fire phone,
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.360]   they would have sold 10 million of them.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.000]   I don't think--
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   No.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.160]   --at this point is that people will buy it just because it's
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.600]   an iPhone.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.040]   Go ahead, Phil.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.600]   Well, you know, a couple of things.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   And then I'll tell you what the Earpods are like.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.600]   I paused.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.360]   I'm very interested.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.000]   Because AirPods are the future, right?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.360]   The AirPods are what Apple wants the future to hold.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.400]   The what's weird about removing the headphone jack
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.760]   on this phone is they didn't have to do it.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.600]   There was plenty of room.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.840]   The whole thing with the headphone jack
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.160]   is you can't put a screen over it.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.920]   So there was that space at the bottom of an iPhone right now
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.760]   that isn't being used by the screen.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.520]   But I have to point at the maligned now, note 7, which
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.400]   is a smaller phone than the iPhone 7
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.080]   plus with a bigger screen and a pen and a headphone jack.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   And they somehow managed to make it all work.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.520]   And it's waterproof.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.800]   So it is--
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.080]   I'm not sure I completely buy Apple's explanation
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.800]   that they had to do it correctly.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.240]   Yeah, well, I don't buy it at all.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.160]   Anyway, I think the deal is that they
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.480]   were going to do it next year with that 10th anniversary
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.440]   phone.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.160]   And they didn't want that phone to come out and all.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.760]   Anybody did was talk about it.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.160]   That makes sense.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.280]   They didn't have a headphone jack.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.320]   So they're getting that out of the way this year.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.360]   It's like classic Apple.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.240]   Remember how they took them several years
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.400]   to get Apple pay--
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.080]   all the pieces of Apple pay in place,
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.240]   stage by stage.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.160]   OK, anyway, so I did go to the demo room
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.640]   and try out the AirPods, which I really
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.800]   want to call earbuds.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.400]   But there you go.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.040]   What you have to know is that I'm
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.400]   like Kryptonite for demos.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.560]   They always go wrong.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.060]   Good.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.560]   Good.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.280]   Here's the scene.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.400]   That's what I want.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.680]   There's a woman with a platter of Virgin AirPods,
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.000]   maybe 16 of them on a platter.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.600]   And when you came up for the demo,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.240]   they'd take a fresh one out and hand it to you
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.080]   and then invite you to open up the little box, which
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.040]   looks like a dental floss box with a magnetic opening.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.800]   And then you kind of reach in and pull out
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.560]   these AirPods, which are in magnetically.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.720]   I actually had trouble getting my nail underneath
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.760]   to pull them out.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.440]   Then you put them in your ear.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.280]   And for me, it didn't work.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.720]   I couldn't hear a thing.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.160]   So they had to put that one back.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.040]   Get out of fresh ear pod and put that in.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.200]   And it didn't work either.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.720]   And then they got a third one.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.040]   And it didn't work.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.480]   And then they decided, maybe you got to restart that iPhone.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.800]   And he was afraid to do that because God knows
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.480]   what was going on inside the demo unit.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.000]   So I had to wait for them to get a whole new iPhone.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.320]   And then a fourth AirPod.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.400]   And finally it worked.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.840]   And I tell you, I'm not an audio expert.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.800]   They sounded great.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.920]   Do they sound better than the current wired?
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.080]   I'm not qualified to say this.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.200]   They sounded really good.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.080]   Pogues said they sound the same as the current wired,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.240]   which would be very disappointing because they are $160.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.560]   I would expect them to have better sound for that price.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.920]   They're shaped exactly the same.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.080]   And the actual audio components are essentially the same.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.120]   So it should sound the same.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.240]   So it should sound the same.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.160]   So all the money goes into it next time.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.000]   They're going to be like, and this is 40% lower bass and 13%
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.880]   more sound than winding.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.120]   They didn't talk about that.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.280]   They didn't talk about that.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.120]   You're paying for that cool little--
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.040]   The dental gloss thing out of your ear.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.480]   You're paying for dental floss box.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.160]   Yeah, by the way.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.440]   And if you're a little annoying that you have ear dribbles
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.000]   on both sides--
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.480]   Have you seen the dribble or a stereo dribble?
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.080]   Oh, it's because you can use--
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.000]   there's a mic in both.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.600]   So if you use just one, there's sensors that will know
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.840]   if you're wearing just one.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.880]   And then you can use either one as a headset.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.240]   Really?
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.640]   And there's smarter enough--
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.880]   It's smarter enough to know when you put them in,
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.720]   it knows you put them in your ear.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.600]   And it automatically switches the sound from whatever
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.560]   you were using to the ear pods.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.480]   And then if you want to talk to someone,
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.560]   you take one out and it lowers the volume on the other one.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.840]   And you can talk.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.880]   And then you put it back in and it knows you've done it.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.880]   That's all pretty cool.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.400]   The downside-- and I think this is actually
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.960]   a serious problem-- is that there's a volume control.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.080]   And the way you control the volume,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.320]   it's all done through series.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.480]   So you have to get series attention and then say,
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.280]   make it louder.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.840]   Oh, you can't turn it up?
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.640]   No.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.400]   Not even with the phone?
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.560]   With the phone, you can.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.320]   But yeah, there's no buttons.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.040]   So the little button thing we had before is gone.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.960]   So I can't just be like, click it.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.200]   By the way, Ben Stiller invented this in the movie,
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.320]   Something About Mary was the first appearance of ear pods.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.880]   I don't know if you remember that scene.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.080]   But that's an ear pod, right there.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.320]   He really was ahead of his time.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.880]   He was ahead of his time.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.800]   Have you seen the pictures of Anne Frank and all the other people
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.000]   with the little ear pods, the people from the old commercial?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.240]   I did read an article.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.520]   And I wish I could remember who, because I can't give him credit.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.480]   But I would like to.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.040]   That I kind of agree with.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.560]   I've been saying for a while that heurables are going to be the next--
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.160]   are going to be the breakthrough with wearables.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.040]   There's not going to be a watch.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.560]   There's not going to be glasses.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.000]   But if you're already wearing earbuds,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.240]   it's coming from both directions.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.400]   In terms of hearing aids, we see I have hearing aids
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.720]   from Starkey that pair with my phone
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.920]   that I can use to listen to music and books.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.560]   And if you have it, Broggy's making these.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.520]   If you have something in your ear,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.960]   it could also not just measure steps,
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.920]   but it could measure your heart rate.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.360]   It could measure blood oxygen.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.160]   It could probably even measure blood pressure,
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.480]   because there's such a thin membrane between your blood
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.400]   and the ear, that these could be the future of wearables.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.800]   And that's the argument for these ear pods,
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.840]   that there's a lot of technology in them.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.360]   They're not just headphones.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.840]   The ear pods, they have accelerometers.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.680]   They have beam forming microphones.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.880]   They have noise canceling.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.120]   When I heard all of that, I got a lot less mad about them
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.040]   and got excited about where they'll be in three years.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.360]   I think that we can all agree that this is a limited--
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.240]   the first Kindle was too expensive,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.720]   didn't do a lot, but had potential.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.680]   And by Kindle 3, whatever it was called,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.280]   it was incredible, low cost and amazing.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.120]   So to me, Apple was saying, hello, world,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.960]   we're all going to go here eventually.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.240]   We're taking the first step back to your courage point.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.360]   And then we'll all get there eventually.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.560]   Hopefully us first, but I am willing to look ahead and say,
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.280]   that sounds super cool in 2000--
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.880]   what year is it, 16, so 19?
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.000]   Sorry, I can't add today.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.080]   Well, but that's going to be janky until then,
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.680]   because the battery life's going to be bad.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.240]   You're going to have five hours.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.960]   What the--
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.840]   I mean, they're actually selling some Beats headphones,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.080]   a new set called the Beats X that
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.400]   had the same W1 chip in it.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.240]   And they're going to sell for, I think, 20, 30 bucks less.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.080]   And they have something like 10 hours of battery life.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.600]   Do you think of the Beats X?
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   They're called the Beats X.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.200]   They never said out loud before they sold them, did they?
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.040]   No, no.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.000]   Not the best, not the best, but--
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.320]   Beats X.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.280]   Well, that was eluding to that, Leo.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.080]   No, it's that.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.720]   But I think you're right.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.600]   It's about building this kind of wireless future.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.760]   And they even talked about it.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.760]   I think Johnny Ivan in his video said,
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.400]   for years we've been working on this future with no wires
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.440]   for any of our products.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.880]   And I mean, if you look at the new MacBook,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.800]   there's one USB C port on it.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.960]   But really, they want you to be using wireless stuff
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.480]   to transfer your files.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.640]   They don't want you to be using wired hard drives
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.680]   or any of this sort of thing.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.840]   The iPad has one port for charging,
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.080]   because Paul's also going to charge it.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.200]   As soon as they can get you wireless charging--
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.120]   and well, they could now-- but as soon as they start
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   implementing wireless charging--
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.920]   They have all that extra room because they took the headphone
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.400]   jack out.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.080]   They should have wireless charging.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.480]   Well, I think eventually the charging port's
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.960]   going to disappear and you'll have wireless charging.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.080]   That is a little frustrating.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.680]   They don't have wireless charging.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.560]   They also don't allow anybody else to use NFC.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.560]   I guess in Japan now, Finka will use NFC.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.160]   I would love to use NFC for my Clipper card.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.480]   My phone just like--
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.400]   Well, in an Android device, I hate to say it.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.640]   You can.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.640]   So I'm really torn on this.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.760]   On the one hand, I want Apple to innovate.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.200]   Farhad Manju writes a scathing article in "The New York Times"
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.480]   saying that really Apple has lost its mojo,
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.760]   that they aren't innovating anymore.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.080]   I love Farhad.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   Farhad.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.560]   He's sort of backed off that with his next piece saying,
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.360]   how much he actually loved all this stuff.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.200]   I am with him because I have the same exact--
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.920]   don't we all have the same exact mixed feelings?
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.440]   In the one hand, we want to believe.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.320]   We want it to be the Apple that brought us the iPod,
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.800]   that brought us the iPad, that brought us the iPhone, which
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.320]   is probably the single biggest technological revolution
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.040]   in my lifetime.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.120]   And at the same time, we look at this stuff
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.480]   and we wonder, are we being taken for a ride?
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.520]   At what point is this innovation?
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.240]   At what point is it just fins on a Cadillac?
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:38.000]   Is it just innovation to get you to buy the next one?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.520]   I don't know if we've been taken for a ride,
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.120]   but I'm definitely in Apple's car and I'm not getting off.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.720]   I notice all of you have a life.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.440]   I mean, I'm in the car, but I'm already unlocking the door.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.040]   I'm waiting for the next stoplight to turn red.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.160]   He's going to get on muting.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.000]   I know where.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.120]   I mean, there's apps on here that I can't get on Android,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.040]   that I really like.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.920]   And I'm just like, that's going to suck.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.800]   But I'll give you an example.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.160]   I use this little port way more than I use those apps.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.720]   The hardware innovation is one thing,
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.040]   but Apple has completely ignored any software innovation
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.280]   on iOS.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.200]   The iOS features they're adding, things
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.760]   like messages with balloons and stickers.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.040]   And meanwhile, the springboard interface on iOS
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.480]   is positively antiquated.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.760]   Is that bad, though?
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.040]   It's really good.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.120]   Do you feel like maybe it's the way it should be?
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.080]   It's easy to use.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.320]   We don't need to make it fancy.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.000]   Yeah, this interface that I've had since the iPhone original
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.480]   is solid, quick, easy to use.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.520]   Don't you just set it?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.880]   Since 2007.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.000]   And it's rocked.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.840]   But here's the thing.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.040]   It's 83, man.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.080]   The talk is still good.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.760]   If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.360]   Which is like this.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.520]   Which is this.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.000]   All right.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.600]   That's not grammatical.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.080]   I think part of what's at play here is with PCs,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.600]   we are used to our software not changing dramatically
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.240]   every year, every two years.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:52.600]   We--
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.520]   Hell, you obviously don't use Windows, do you?
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.040]   We held on to laptops and desktops for a long time.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.960]   Apple helped create this cycle where every year there's
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.920]   something new.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.400]   And every two years, you're buying a new device.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.680]   So now they're getting deemed for not being able to keep up
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.880]   with this pace.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.520]   But they kind of originated this pace.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.000]   And Samsung lives up to it now as well.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.720]   The whole mobile market is judged by how many phones you
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.040]   can sell every year or two.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.640]   So to a certain extent, I think there is some of this.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.840]   We are actually building a great future.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.320]   There's going to be some cool stuff.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.280]   All this wireless stuff is going to make sense, you know,
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.080]   five, 10 years down the road.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.440]   But in the short term, they also have
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.920]   to have something new to stay on stage every single year.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.040]   And so I think there's a little bit of both at play here.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.080]   You're being a bit nice because that's
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.360]   why we had the S releases.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.960]   6S, 5S, 4S.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   We give them a year off.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   But again, they created this two years cycle.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.720]   Oh no, it's their fault.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.080]   But we shouldn't let them off the hook.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.120]   I mean, when they say iPhone 7, I
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.000]   expect that to be a full featured number of releases,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.120]   as opposed to a .5, which the S is--
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.160]   But part of the problem is where--
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.040]   this is a fairly well-evolved product.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.960]   You don't want to just change it for changes sake.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.480]   Exactly.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.800]   You want to improve it.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.200]   Philip, what's your feeling?
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.480]   You've been watching this since 1984 for crying out loud.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.120]   This isn't the same Apple, is it?
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.880]   I mean, after all.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.320]   Well, it was pretty messed up in 1984.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.440]   They had to fire the founder, the co-founder.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.720]   I think you've said it.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.320]   The smartphone is on an S curve.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.920]   It's an immensely successful product.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.320]   Apple is making sustaining improvements every year.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.560]   This was a little disappointing in terms of a sustaining
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.520]   improvement, because it was the same form factor
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.240]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.680]   I sort of look to see, well, is there something
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.960]   I come out of this thing saying, geez, I got to have that.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.880]   I really, really want to have that.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.440]   And I got to say, I want to have those AirPods.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.080]   I don't care so much about the new--
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.800]   I want to have much about the new 18-year pods, AirPods.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.680]   I mean, I feel like these are going
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.760]   to be a little bit of a struggle.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.040]   They're going to be a little challenging.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.640]   But I think they're moving in the right direction.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.960]   And that explains the loss of the headphone port.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.240]   We're going to go wireless.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.640]   That's exactly how it's going to be better.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.760]   I mean, the future of computing is going to be all wireless
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.120]   implants in our brain that talk to us.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.320]   It's going to be awesome.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.960]   This is just step 0.001 on that.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.560]   I have to point out that one of the things we've said is,
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.960]   well, the market will decide whether--
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.520]   and the market seems to quite like this new phone.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.800]   We were talking before the show.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.960]   It was darn hard to get one.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.280]   I don't know.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.440]   I stayed up to midnight.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.040]   Philip, you would have had to stay up to 3 AM to get one.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.000]   And I was trying to get a jet black.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.360]   They were gone instantly.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.440]   I wonder if they even had any.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.600]   I think they made those much smaller numbers.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.000]   So those are pushed off to October 4th.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.400]   And they're now November.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.160]   In fact, I think all of them are now November.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.120]   So while we--
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.200]   and an apple said, we're not going
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.640]   to give you sales numbers from the weekend
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.400]   because it's supply constrained, not demand constrained.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.880]   So we can't make any decision about demand
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.480]   because we don't know what the supply is.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.000]   But presuming that apple did what it usually does,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.200]   which made millions of them ahead of time.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.640]   The market did weigh in.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.400]   They loved it.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.680]   Do you think they made less?
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   I mean, I sold iPhone sales and slowly going down.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.560]   And they're like, you know what?
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.440]   Let's be smart about this.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.160]   Let's not make too many iPhones.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.040]   I mean, apple's been really smart about inventory.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.240]   Anything that's sitting in a warehouse is losing money.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   I'll tell you why I don't think so.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.040]   Because when they say before they go on sale,
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.160]   we're not going to give you numbers because it's supply
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.040]   constrained.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.960]   They're saying the demand will be higher
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.600]   than whatever number we've made.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.760]   That's always been--
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.160]   Yeah, but no company wants it to be that way.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.720]   You'd like to sell an iPhone to every single person
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.920]   who wants one and they want.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.520]   And make one more than that.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:50.880]   Right.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.280]   Exactly.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:51.880]   Plus one.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.800]   Plus one.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.880]   And so it's dork plus one.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.320]   Maybe it's not.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.240]   Maybe it's hard to make, although I can't think it's
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.520]   that hard to make because it's essentially
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.320]   the same exact phone as last year.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   Maybe the jet black is hard to make.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.880]   There's a guy with some needle nose pliers
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.440]   just pulling out headphone jacks.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.040]   Putting some bond over the hole.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.000]   They've done nothing in this phone
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.560]   to justify, oh, well, this is tricky.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.880]   It's going to take us a while.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.920]   OK, true.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.720]   But I can imagine the AirPods in two years being so cool
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.960]   that I feel the need to buy a new iPhone to give me off
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.800]   my current six which I love because they can't ever do those things.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.360]   So were you buying seven?
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.880]   I'm going to buy the seven S because my cycle goes through.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.600]   You're on the S.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.120]   Yeah, I'm on the S cycle.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.640]   Sadly.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.120]   Now, some people here would know none of whom
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.080]   shall be named already have one because they're
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.160]   on the review circuit.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:38.920]   Don't look at me.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.560]   What?
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.520]   Don't look at me.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.520]   But look at me.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.840]   I actually was able to get one on Friday.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.160]   It'll come on Friday.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.760]   But only because I was willing to use a less popular color.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.680]   What color do you end up getting?
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.160]   Gold.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.360]   Gold.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:52.840]   There you go.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.160]   Two year old color, not even rose gold.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.600]   Gold.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.480]   I'd like to see him mix it up with a blue or something like that.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.880]   I mean, there was a rumor blue.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.080]   Right?
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:02.960]   So gosh.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.120]   I would like an orange iPhone.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.800]   So I just want an orange iPhone.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.600]   Between rose gold and gold.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.080]   It's like--
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.640]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.280]   And Phillip, if you want to stick around,
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.360]   you're more than welcome to.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.800]   We're going to talk about the watch next.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.680]   I don't know if you have anything to say about the watch.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.560]   I'm excited.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.960]   I wouldn't mind buying that.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.560]   I just want to tell you my Angela Aaron's close encounter
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.040]   story.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.880]   There's a pecking order to the journalists
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.840]   who come to these things.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.800]   And I'm not one of the ones who got invited early
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.760]   to see the things before the keynote.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.200]   Some people did though.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.520]   Who was that?
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.360]   Oh, like Ben Bajaren.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.040]   And I assume Walt Mossberg.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.040]   Which cast me?
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.640]   There was a scene--
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.280]   Mark Gurman made his first appearance at one of these things.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.360]   There was this power group of Mossberg, Nylie--
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.200]   So when Gurman was at 9-5, he was a persona non-grada
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.600]   because he had all the scoops.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.440]   But now that he's with Bloomberg, he gets to go.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:01.940]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.440]   That's right.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:02.840]   Interesting.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.240]   Anyway, I'm coming in late to see the demo room.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.760]   And there's Angela Aaron's coming towards me.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.120]   Now, when they first hired Angela Aaron's
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.800]   for $1 million, she looked so good.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.400]   And I thought--
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.800]   She was the CEO of Burberry.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.360]   They hired to run retail.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.960]   And they haven't really buy her out of her contract
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.520]   because she isn't CEO, obviously, at Apple.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.880]   So they had to give her a ton of money.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.080]   Right.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.600]   She gave up a CEO position to be the head of retail.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.280]   And it seemed like it only made sense for her
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.520]   if there was an upward trajectory.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.680]   And I thought she was going to be a great on-screen presence,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.280]   kind of female Steve Jobs.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   And we haven't seen it hide her hair ever.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.120]   And so I wrote several things.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.760]   And when are we going to see her on stage?
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.080]   So there she was in front of me.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.520]   And I said, Angela, when are we going to see you on stage?
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.320]   And she touched my shoulder and said, me, never.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:56.800]   Really?
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:57.960]   That's her choice.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.680]   So there's a little piece of news for her.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.760]   Do you think it's her choice?
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.400]   Yeah, I do.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.000]   I don't know what they had in mind for her.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.760]   But I can see her getting--
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.760]   being in a room with Schiller and these old war horses who
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.440]   have been playing Apple politics from day one
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.200]   and thinking, oh, geez.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.440]   I'm not going to be honest.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.960]   Phil has made too many blunders at this point.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.160]   I would not put Phil Schiller on the stage again.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.920]   He is living up to his name, a total Schill.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:29.480]   First, he tells us about the Mac Pro and says, innovate my ass.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.040]   And then, oh, they just forgot about it for the last three
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:32.680]   years.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   And lately, courage completely bungles that.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.840]   I think Schiller is the guy not to put on stage.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.920]   And I bet you Angela, she speaks to--
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.800]   she's spoken to the retail people.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.840]   She does quite a good job.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.680]   I think they should bring her on stage.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.360]   She has weekly things with them.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.440]   She's a big presence within retail.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.080]   But according to her, she's not going
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.280]   to be a big presence on stage.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.040]   So anyway, two Apple's credit, lots of diversity on stage,
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.240]   enough women so that you didn't have to say, oh, they
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.520]   have a woman anymore.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.320]   I've got to be very much praised for that.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.200]   And I have to point out that their camera--
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.840]   we were talking about this during the event.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.480]   There was an article a few months ago
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.080]   about how it might be that way Kodak film was made.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.520]   Film was made that contributed to the racism
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.760]   in this country because black skins came out very much
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.960]   darker, almost completely featurelessly dark compared
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.800]   to white skins.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.760]   The film was made for Caucasians and disadvantaged
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.440]   anybody else.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.600]   Apple showed-- every time they showed samples from the camera,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.120]   they made sure they had a person of color in those images.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.760]   And they looked great.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.640]   And I think this is Apple tacitly saying,
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.440]   we embrace diversity and we want to make sure our products work
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.240]   for everyone.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.880]   And I have to praise them for that.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.880]   I mean, when I was in film school,
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.200]   like my cinematography teacher was an African American woman,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.760]   she's like, my skin, it's so hard to shoot for me
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.960]   because that's not what film is made for.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.120]   They don't make it for it.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.080]   The film isn't made for my skin.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.960]   And she's like, so you know, she's telling us
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.480]   the truth.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   It's not used to it.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   It's true.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.080]   It's been a case for years.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.840]   And this is Kodak Fuji.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.680]   I mean, every of them.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   All of them.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.360]   So, Philip, we're going to let you go unless you
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.080]   want to stick around.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.920]   You're always welcome.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.880]   You know that.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.080]   Well, call me anytime.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.480]   OK.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   Thanks.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:21.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.920]   Go and visit Philip's site.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.160]   There's lots more there, including a rundown of what
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.280]   analysts think about this.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.960]   We don't report on that so much because I don't care
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.320]   what the stock market thinks.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.360]   But if you go to PED30, you can at least see that and lots more.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.040]   And Philip does a great thing with PED30.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.760]   There's a free article every day,
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.880]   but there's also paid articles in the subscriptions
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.360]   are what keeps him going.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.920]   17 buys, three holds in one cell.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.840]   Sounds like Wall Street liked what they heard.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.640]   Philip, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.680]   PED30.com.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.320]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.440]   Take care.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.920]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.880]   We will talk about the watch because you said you want
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.800]   to talk about the watch.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.480]   I pointed very carefully your screen.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.920]   Yeah, be able to.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.720]   You know, I feel like Apple's kind of almost tacitly saying,
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.680]   yeah, that watch is not doing so good.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.520]   But we'll-- but we'll see.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.320]   We'll see if series two can change it.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.880]   We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.520]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV, a great way.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.800]   If you're an IT professional to keep up with your business,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.040]   a great way if you want to be an IT professional
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.760]   to get into the business.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.480]   You know, you've got to get those certs for that first job,
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.120]   but it's tough.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.920]   You can go to a technical school and spend
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.360]   tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.720]   You could buy study materials, spend thousands of dollars.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.320]   This is a new way and a better way, ITProTV.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.000]   And even if you're already an ITPro,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.400]   a good ITPro is always learning.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.320]   And it's the best way to stay up to date with current technology
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.800]   to get those certs.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.120]   They're high quality video tutorials, thousands
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.720]   of hours of content.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.560]   And they add 30 more every week.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.000]   In fact, we're going to fly out to Florida.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.840]   They're opening their new studio in the next couple of weeks.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.520]   And we're going to go say hi to Tim and Don there in Gainesville
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.040]   because I think they have five new studios.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.160]   Five.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.960]   And as somebody who just built one new studio,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.120]   I can appreciate the effort that goes into that.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.480]   They are really ramping up to bring you courses on every topic.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.880]   Right now CCN, routing and switching, CISM,
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.680]   they're doing those great certified ethical hacker courses.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.880]   What a great cert that would be.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.720]   I'd love that.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.640]   Apple, Amazon, Cisco, everything.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.480]   And you have transcripts so you can follow them from start
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.920]   to finish or find the part of the video you want to watch
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.400]   and jump right to that.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.040]   You can stream them on your Chromecast, your Roku, your Fire TV.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.720]   They have an Apple TV, Apple course.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.240]   You can watch on your PC or your tablet.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.520]   And if you buy your subscription by the year instead
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.680]   of the month, you can even download them and watch them offline.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.800]   These guys are great.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.960]   They have virtual machine labs.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.600]   So you don't even have to own a copy of Windows Server or Windows.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.000]   You could do it all from an HTML5 browser.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.040]   You could take the exam before you take the exam
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.040]   with their Transcendo Practice exams.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.160]   That's worth 109 bucks just by itself.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.360]   They've got study groups.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.520]   They've got Q&A time.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.480]   They really do a wonderful job.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.080]   And as far as corporate goes, pretty much everybody,
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:18.920]   every major university, Harvard, MIT, UCSD, Stanford,
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.360]   are clients of ITProTV.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.240]   That's how they keep their IT team up to snuff.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.200]   And if you currently-- if you have an enterprise account
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.600]   with a competitor and you just got a rate increase,
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.840]   I think you know who you are.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.440]   ITProTV will match your previous year's pricing on that account
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.680]   so you and your team can continue to learn at an affordable rate.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:44.520]   Go to ITProTV/Twit to get a very special deal.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.520]   30% off the life of your account and seven days free
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.840]   when you use the offer code TWIT30.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:57.880]   That's ITProTV/Twit and the offer code is TWIT30.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.480]   We're talking about the week's tech news, great panel.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.600]   Always love having these young guys in.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.760]   I'm actually 57.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.280]   Yeah, so you--
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.440]   He looks really good, though, for example.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.640]   Hasn't he look good?
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   Wow, that's a great--
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.520]   So my bones are so brittle.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.640]   Yeah, we had you scheduled a few weeks ago,
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.960]   and you had a bail because you broke your foot.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:16.480]   Are you OK?
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.360]   Yeah, you feel better?
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.960]   Yeah, yeah, I broke my ankle chasing a kitten down
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.360]   the stairs, which is a very--
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   That's not true.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.640]   Which, no, this is actually true.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.160]   The can't work for BuzzFeed, do you?
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.600]   No, don't I change the car?
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.360]   If BuzzFeed ever give me a job to just write about kittens,
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.440]   just the right and chase kittens, I would be--
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.360]   Yeah, sure.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.200]   I'll do that.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.400]   I give up everything.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.760]   But it was a street fight, actually.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.160]   It was a street fight with the kitten.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.640]   And you lost the parents.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.640]   I lost.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.320]   Don't say--
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.560]   Yeah, you ought to see the kitten.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.400]   Yeah, no, no, kitten looks fine.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   That was really just sitting in the corner looking--
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   Aww.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:46.920]   Aww.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.400]   Kids fine.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   How big is it?
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.240]   Is it a little kitten?
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.200]   Yeah, he's a little kitten.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.320]   Don't chase kittens.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.160]   Six months old now.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.200]   Ask what his cat's name is already is, too.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:54.920]   What are your cats name?
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.600]   So we got two brothers, two kittens,
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.080]   and their name's Sig Frieden Roy.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.080]   Oh, that's cute.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.080]   That's good.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.440]   You're so bad at yourself.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.480]   You're like, watch this.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.400]   I love that.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   I think it's hilarious.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.640]   And Oliveira's child's always setting up his friends.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.160]   It's great to have you two from the Wall Street.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.160]   I have no pets.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:11.680]   I have no pets.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.880]   I have no pets.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.280]   You have no weaknesses there.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.320]   But I'm the go-to dog sitter for all my friends.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:16.800]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   Because I have no pets.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.320]   Oh, that's true.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.040]   And that's nice.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.520]   Nope.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.040]   No.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.400]   Your Instagram lights up when you get a dog.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.960]   My Instagram lights up.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.480]   Were you posting Goron pictures before?
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.160]   Was that you?
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.320]   That's why I thought it was.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.920]   Goron the French bulldog.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.320]   Yeah, it's a Mark--
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.560]   Mark D'Alene from L'Harmoury.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.080]   From L'Harmoury.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.640]   Yep, so good.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.040]   And also with us, Alex Wilhelm from Mattermark.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.960]   You are an analyst.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.720]   You follow the markets as well.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.080]   I do.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:41.760]   And you track the markets.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.880]   And you made fun of my entire hobby
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.920]   in past time before the break.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.840]   So what's your hobby in past time?
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   Stock market.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.960]   So now we're just not--
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.040]   No, I'm not making fun of it.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.080]   I'm saying that--
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.640]   Oh, I see them.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.800]   Back it up, back it up.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.400]   I'll tell you exactly.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.200]   The problem-- first of all, analysts
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.280]   are talking to a different audience.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.720]   They're talking to an investor audience.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.520]   That's not what we're talking about.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.680]   We're talking about the value of the products,
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.240]   the utility of the product, whether companies
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.520]   is a good company.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.080]   That isn't necessarily the important news for an investor.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.600]   Definitely not.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.240]   Right?
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.800]   Well, I'm not actually an analyst.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.040]   I don't really write for investors.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:16.560]   No, no.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:16.560]   No, no.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.200]   I'm not talking about you.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:17.560]   No, no, no.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.000]   In general, I think you're totally correct.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.280]   That's why there's a disconnect between the Wall Street
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.320]   chatter we hear.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.640]   Well, we talk about here in tech and with the public itself
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.280]   here.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.960]   And there's three different conversations,
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.840]   which is why we get confused when new things come out.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.520]   And stock market doesn't change its value of the stock at all.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.640]   And we go, why not?
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.960]   Because, again, different conversation
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.560]   and different topics even.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:35.960]   So it's just--
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.440]   Well, and I say that as a cautionary tale to our audience,
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.160]   who the news is going to cover if an Apple stock goes down,
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:42.760]   be for sure.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.800]   And announced that they're going to say, oh, look,
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.200]   the market tanked.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.760]   But it isn't necessarily in reaction to the announcement.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.200]   For sure.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.560]   You buy on the room, or you sell on the news.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.160]   They're working on a different level
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.760]   and a different plane than a normal user is.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.440]   So I think that the utility of stock market information,
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.160]   of earnings and all of that, isn't really
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.880]   completely useful to what we do.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.880]   But we do depend on it for unit volumes, revenue growth,
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.720]   euro-of-year declines, segment changes.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.320]   Well, I certainly would love to know, for instance,
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.080]   if this iPhone sells as well as previously.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.600]   Exactly.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.880]   But you don't really care about their non-GAP EPS
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   before extraordinary items.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.480]   Oh, I do.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.000]   Oh, I do too.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.840]   Which one is GAP?
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.280]   Again?
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.000]   GAP's the good one, and non-GAP is the bad one.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:22.480]   It's the bad one.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.080]   Non-GAP is like Diet Coke or decaf coffee.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:25.840]   You don't test it.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.840]   I totally can use that.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.680]   I totally understand that.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.040]   And that's why I think it's good to have all three
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.680]   conversations.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.600]   Works for our parents, works for us, works for them.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.880]   But I do the cautionary thing every time we do stock market
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.720]   stuff, because you have to read it with the right eye.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.880]   What I care about, and I think our audience cares about,
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.600]   is should I buy this phone?
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:41.960]   Right.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.520]   Is Apple doing the right thing?
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.440]   Is this a sensible plan?
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.920]   Not what's their stock--
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.760]   although, and I mention this also, the stock price
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.560]   does have some importance to companies like Apple and Twitter,
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.960]   for instance, because that's how they compensate employees.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.200]   It gives them--
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.720]   it's an important tool for them to be
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.400]   able to hire good engineers.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:04.520]   Speaking of which, Apple apparently is back and down on the car.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.680]   They have laid off.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.640]   I'm jumping way ahead.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.680]   We'll go back to the watch in a second.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.720]   According to the New York Times, Daisuke Waka Bayashi, who
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.000]   does some great reporting on Apple and Brian X Chen,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.720]   say that Apple, according to their sources,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.720]   is rethinking the self-driving car.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.840]   Has laid off dozens of employees.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.040]   They've got three different people on this.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.880]   And this doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.600]   I really didn't think this was a good direction for Apple
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.520]   to be going in anyway.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.920]   It's super crowded.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.160]   And I think everyone thought the automakers, especially
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.520]   these tech companies, thought the automakers
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.080]   were just going to sit on their laurels and let them--
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.640]   and let the Googles and the Apples and the microsors
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.920]   make the self-driving car.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.720]   They're going to let the TV arrows.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.440]   And as soon as they got it figured out, GM's going to say,
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:47.960]   thank you.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.160]   Everyone's working-- Mercedes is working on it.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.960]   Audi's working on it.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.360]   GM's.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.960]   Everybody is working on--
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.040]   and forged Super Harcourt into anything mobility,
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.880]   including autonomous driving.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.640]   So the automakers are really stepping up.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.560]   They're really pushing Super Harcourt.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.400]   They sandbagged.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.120]   I think they pretended lack of interest.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.160]   I remember asking for it every year.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.080]   So tell me about your autonomous car.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.360]   And what's his name would always say, oh no, people love
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:12.840]   to drive.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.520]   We're never doing an autonomous car.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.200]   And I said, come on.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.880]   You got Alan, Alan and Lally.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.520]   You got a guy in the back working on this.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.440]   Of course they did.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.560]   You asked Alan that question?
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:22.960]   Yes.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.560]   That's awesome.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.240]   Year after year, I asked him now.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.760]   How often do you have dinner with this guy?
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.120]   Actually, I don't know why, but Alan
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.880]   used to give me great access.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.360]   Yeah, Alan.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.480]   What happened to that also?
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:31.920]   Where's my accent?
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.160]   I haven't talked to Mark.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.520]   Mark heard the-- not Mark heard.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.040]   Mark Lane?
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.200]   Mark heard the old CEO of HP.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.040]   That's another story entirely now at Oracle.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.160]   Because I got into the argument with Ford a couple years
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.120]   ago about putting in cell phone connectivity, actually
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:45.800]   into vehicles.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.880]   It was four or five years ago.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.040]   And they said, it's too expensive.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.960]   We don't have the margins for it.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.720]   We can't do it.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.600]   We'd know in one set.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.320]   And of course now.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:51.840]   And they did.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:52.340]   Right.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.160]   And it's incredibly popular.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.760]   I think, given the time frame of car companies,
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.360]   five years at least, they're working on all this stuff.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.960]   They've never been working on it forever.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.200]   I think they're working on this.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.320]   I think you're also seeing the interest
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.480]   and the focus for pretty much all the tech
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.400]   companies are involved moving towards alliances
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.800]   and towards building software.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.360]   That's what we thought maybe everyone would want to do.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.720]   But Tesla's Elon Musk has always said,
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.080]   the key for us is to do it all.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.120]   You need the information you get from the cars
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.400]   to improve the software.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.720]   You can't outsource.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.840]   In fact, they've even brought the cameras and everything
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.480]   in-house now.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.040]   Because Elon said, no, no, we have to do it all
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.120]   to get that information.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.840]   Data is very important.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:38.480]   Today's announcement about the Autopilot 8.0 that's
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.800]   coming out in the next two weeks,
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   they did all of it in-house.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.360]   They didn't use mobile i because they
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.680]   sort of broken up in mobile i.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.880]   That's the camera company.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.080]   So now their next update to the Autopilot
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:55.840]   to the in-car is infotainment system is all in-house.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.880]   It's all Tesla.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.920]   They're doing everything.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.680]   That means they're getting all the information.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.560]   It's a great car for a geek.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.680]   For instance, when you turn up the sound, it goes to 11.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.520]   There's lots of little things.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.200]   No, now when I was driving the Model X,
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   I was turning everything up.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.480]   You could turn up the fan goes to 11.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.000]   Everything goes 11.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.680]   They just added in 7.1 because they update.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.000]   I get updates as often as I do on a phone or a computer.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.400]   They update every few weeks.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.960]   In 7.1, if you tap the Autopilot twice normally,
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.000]   it turns on Autopilot four times,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.440]   you get a rock riff coming out of your radio
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.160]   and a rainbow road stretching out of head of you.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:29.560]   Wow.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.520]   I'm sure it's a reference to something I don't know.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.320]   Remember from Super Mario Brothers?
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.600]   Or Super Mario Kart?
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.320]   It's Mario Kart.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.840]   So you're driving Mario Kart.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.040]   So that song-- you know what?
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.240]   Get in the car with me after the show.
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:39.760]   All right.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.560]   Tell me what you want.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, stranger's cars.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.440]   I was told.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:42.640]   Sorry.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.120]   Oh.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:44.880]   We know him.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.240]   Sorry.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.200]   I've got candy.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.240]   Oh, he's got candy.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.800]   And he needs help looking for his lost pups.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.720]   Is that why the doors are locked?
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.160]   OK.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.360]   Anyway, back to Apple.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.600]   But I thought that was-- well, this is Apple, isn't it?
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.960]   Apple kind of pulling back on something that people--
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.840]   it's like the TV.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.800]   I never bought it.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.720]   I thought--
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.200]   The margins on TV are so slim.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.760]   That was-- I think they were just very much.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.080]   Let's work on something and look at--
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.960]   I mean, Apple's going to do R&D on a ton of stuff
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.560]   they'll never release just so they either--
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.960]   Are they going to be on a market or B?
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.920]   They'll be ahead if case there's a change.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.600]   Oh, and when you have $200 billion in the bank,
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.400]   you can afford--
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.240]   You can just be out somebody's--
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.200]   I'll throw a billion at that--
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.640]   You know what, eat autonomous goats.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.400]   They're probably working on it.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.840]   It's a great idea.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   That's just--
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.640]   Wait, wait, hold on.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.400]   Tim Cook at the--
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   Tim Cook at the--
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   Tim Cook at the--
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.240]   I love it.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:30.760]   I love it.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.240]   Go for it.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:31.920]   There's a billion.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.400]   Go make it so.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.400]   We got that old warehouse in Sunnyville.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.240]   We're not using that anymore.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:36.800]   Go in there.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.400]   He's got Johnny.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.800]   I just sit in the corner.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.440]   He's out there.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.400]   Most--
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.240]   Just starts drawing--
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.800]   Feral goats, we've ever made.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.200]   OK, but just keep in mind that when you look
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.080]   at Apple's cash position, you just deduct all that debt.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.240]   It's all European, I know.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   Yeah, it's foreign currency.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   They have a lot of domestic debt.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.800]   So it looks a lot more than it is.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.600]   Just keep that in mind.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.280]   So they need foreign goats.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.600]   Take-- Come into America and take
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.880]   our American goats' jobs.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.720]   This is what you're saying.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.560]   Make goats great again.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.240]   OK.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.040]   This is devolved really quickly.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.040]   Goats 2016.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.200]   Goats.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.360]   Apple Watch series two.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.760]   First of all, I feel so bad for anybody
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.240]   who bought the gold Apple Watch.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.080]   I don't think many people did considering they basically
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.240]   got rid of the $10,000.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.560]   Without a word, they dropped it.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.240]   There's no upgrade path for it.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.640]   At least, if somebody spends $10,000 in a watch,
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.560]   you could say we could put the new guts in.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.360]   You want those?
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.000]   But no.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.840]   I think the $10,000 watch were bought by the same people
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.520]   who buy $10,000 bags.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.360]   It was nothing for them.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.880]   And $7,000 shoes.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.040]   $7,000 shoes?
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.000]   Yeah, they're--
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Like TMZ.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.280]   TMZ, yes.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.320]   I drove around with a $20,000 dress
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.760]   in the back of my $500 Honda Civic Watch.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.920]   But it looked great on you.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.600]   $20,000 dress.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.760]   It was-- it was black and silver.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.400]   It was great.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.440]   It was really slimming.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.880]   I didn't have the shoes for it, though.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   I was still wearing the car.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.880]   You didn't sell $7,000 shoes.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   Yeah, it's hard to get this.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.880]   But pumps the size of leather.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.480]   The people who bought the $10,000 watch,
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.080]   I would say a majority of them were the people who didn't care.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:49:59.580]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.080]   About a watch.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:00.680]   Look at that.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.160]   Well, Pharrell gets in the car, right?
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.920]   In the beginning of the Apple event,
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.480]   the James Corden, it's kind of sad because Apple bought
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.600]   Carpool Karaoke.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.800]   But fired James Corden, they're not
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.160]   going to use him in their carpool.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:12.660]   Turn around.
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.320]   He's watched it.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.560]   Who's going to host it?
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.680]   Some other person.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.080]   What the--
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:16.880]   It's Johnny I.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.680]   Johnny I.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.800]   That's all SIGALON.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.040]   That's what he's been doing all this time.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.520]   He's working on his vocal performance.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.640]   Anyway, Corden's driving--
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.240]   It's got a nice place.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.440]   Tim Cook.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.640]   And then who gets in the car for?
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.560]   And of course, remember when the gold Apple Watch came out,
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.880]   we saw Pharrell's Instagram with that beautiful gold watch.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.960]   Kanye had one for all.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.840]   Had one, Jazzy.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.400]   It's a red watch.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.560]   He was wearing a giant regular watch.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.880]   He wasn't even wearing an Apple Watch when he gets in the car.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.880]   Oh.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.360]   So that's got to hurt, right?
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.560]   $1,000,000 we paid him to sit in the back seat for 5,000
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.640]   wearing an Apple Watch, though.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.480]   I didn't see that.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.440]   An Apple Watch, but not a gold watch.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.520]   So now here comes a series two.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.240]   The addition, there still is a high priced one,
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.280]   is white ceramic.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.640]   It looks beautiful.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.000]   Really?
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.440]   I really think it looks nice.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.680]   Can we get a picture of it?
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.760]   Will it have one?
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.000]   On Apple's website.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:02.720]   Not too lazy.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.640]   I'll show you.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.600]   I'll show you.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:09.040]   So the problem is it's $1,299, which
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.320]   is a huge discount from $10,000.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.480]   $4,000, highest end watch.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.680]   It does seem cheap, doesn't it?
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.400]   It's $9,000 off.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.440]   People say ceramic, that can't be right.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.840]   But no, this is not a porcelain doll ceramic.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   It's like Corningware?
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.960]   They say it's harder than aluminum.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:28.880]   It's harder than steel.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.800]   It's twice as short as steel.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   It does not scratch.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.240]   Like all glasses, it could shatter if hit in a certain way.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.760]   But really, you have to--
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.280]   You really got to give it up.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:38.780]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:39.720]   It looks just a field one.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.000]   Give it the best ceramic one.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.240]   I've had regular analog ceramic watches in the past.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.360]   They're very nice.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.040]   But I had black.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.040]   I didn't have white.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.600]   This looks like-- and it comes with a rubber band.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.760]   In a lost blue phlomer blend.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.840]   So I just-- anyway, $12.99.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.680]   And of course, I bought one.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.720]   Because I have to.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   You actually don't--
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.600]   Well, for your Tesla--
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.640]   You get in a Tesla with a regular Apple watch,
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.280]   it won't start.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.360]   No, because I'm going to take a hammer to it.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.360]   I want to see--
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.160]   Whoa.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.560]   Whoa, you are?
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.200]   Sure, why not?
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.120]   Can I do it?
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.960]   I got a live stream there.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   I got it.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.000]   I volunteer.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.160]   No, because I volunteer as true.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.240]   I always buy whatever-- like the new color.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.520]   See how very true this is.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.120]   Well, there's no point in reviewing the gold phone.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.600]   You got to review the Jet Black phone.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.440]   And there's no point in reviewing a stainless steel
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:28.880]   Apple watch.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.720]   We already know about that one.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.440]   True that.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.200]   So I hit the bullet, $12.99.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.280]   For a watch, actually, if you buy nice watches,
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.480]   not back to the picture.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.760]   I do wonder, though, and this is actually something I wish
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.800]   we could have talked about when Phillip was still on,
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.920]   but in hiring Burberry's CEO to come and run retail,
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.680]   that's a big luxury move.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.760]   Huge, absolutely.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.280]   Abishions.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.920]   That's saying Apple's a fashion brand.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.600]   Exactly.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.960]   In redesign stores like they did with the Union Square,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   one in San Francisco.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.440]   And they said it--
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:58.960]   Of course.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.160]   It's gorgeous, huge, right?
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.240]   And with releasing a $10,000 gold Apple watch,
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.040]   that's high-end fashion stuff.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.800]   It brought those to Paris runways and all this.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.320]   Now I feel like it seems like they're trying to scale things
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.000]   back a little bit.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.600]   No gold watches.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.320]   No way retrenching.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.920]   And when they talked about the Apple watch
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.960]   at this event last week, the focus was specifically
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.520]   on fitness, which makes sense.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.840]   That's the best thing the Apple watches for at this point.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.960]   And they had that partnership with Nike.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.760]   They still have the Hermes version.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.120]   Yeah, that was a lot smaller though,
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.080]   the announcement, though, compared to the Nike track.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:34.580]   Exactly.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:39.280]   The focus now, to me, it seems like, is sports and fitness.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.440]   The ability to swim, it's got now waterproof,
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.480]   so you can use it as a swimmer.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.680]   I wonder if they're trying to--
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.960]   And not saying they're giving up on the luxury and ambitions.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.640]   I mean, they still make products that
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.080]   are generally more expensive than they're competitors.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:52.600]   Yeah, but let's face it.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.280]   This is a thick, ugly ass watch.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.280]   This is not--
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.120]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.520]   This is not a beautiful watch.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.240]   A lot of watches are thick.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.680]   There's not a lot of super thin watches out there.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.800]   This is a beautiful watch.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.920]   That's an Android way of--
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.240]   It's probably just as thick.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.040]   Yeah, that's a pretty thick watch.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.800]   But it's way too thick.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.000]   I mean, most of the luxury watches that are out there
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.360]   are thick.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.000]   Well, I just don't wear any of them, but--
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:13.840]   No, they're not thick.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.360]   They're big.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.640]   Tell me the difference.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.800]   So they're big for--
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.680]   They wear a sundial on your wrist.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.080]   Big no, it's funny.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.960]   Bigger in watches is always considered--
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.760]   I guess because it's a status symbol, right?
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.520]   Shouts.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   I'm wearing an expensive watch.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.280]   I feel like Apple's kind of acknowledged
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.840]   that the watch is not all they had hoped it would be.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.360]   Maybe.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.320]   In fact, their sales are poor.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.960]   IDC said that down 56%--
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.720]   Still the best on smartwatch, but--
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.720]   No, but it's not.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.840]   Well, OK, so this is important.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.760]   Late on me.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.560]   I think that what they say when they mean smartwatches
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.800]   versus Android wear, if you talk about Fitbit
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.400]   and Fitbit has some fitness watches, they add so.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.080]   They were up by almost the same margin that Apple was down.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:54:59.600]   Interesting.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.000]   And they're easily number one.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.080]   So I think you're right.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:06.200]   Fitness is clearly the market space, not fashion.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.120]   They have to acknowledge, look, we understand.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.720]   It looks like you're wearing a smartwatch.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.560]   But think of all the things it's going to do.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.200]   But I asked a runner--
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.800]   we had Adam Anks to have tidbits on during the event.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.760]   And hey, this guy's a runner.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.080]   I said, would you wear an Apple watch?
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.320]   I said, no, I'm going to wear my Garmin, the Runner's Watch.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.520]   All runners-- they wear Runner's watches
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.560]   that are specifically designed.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.920]   And the Apple watch is just not--
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.880]   it's not specific enough to that category.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.520]   It's a general workout watch.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.720]   If you're just like GPS, they're like, oh, I can run around
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.200]   my block, and then I'm going to go eat some french fries
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.800]   and maybe have a milkshake on Twitter.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.080]   And that's what I do with my workouts.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:43.680]   It's fantastic.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.800]   Whoever buddies.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.840]   But I was disappointed that the new addition, the waterproofing,
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.320]   isn't really relevant to my use case.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.560]   Because even though I'm trying to work out more, I don't swim.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.120]   And so--
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:52.640]   Shit swim.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.040]   Well, you could shower with it.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:54.480]   But I don't--
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.120]   And no.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:55.620]   No.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.280]   You don't shower either?
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.160]   I'm blind.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.280]   I can't see anything without glasses.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.840]   What about this?
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.440]   This is fundamentally the problem with the Apple Watch
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.400]   is the user interface just doesn't work.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.960]   It's just too hard.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.480]   With a screen that's small and the number of dials and buttons
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.680]   and functions that they're trying to get in there,
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.840]   it's too hard to use, I think.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.200]   And this from the guy who's wearing an Android Wear
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.600]   Watch right now, which is way more complicated.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:21.080]   No, it isn't.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.160]   It does less.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.080]   It does less.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.200]   It does less, and it's harder to use.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.400]   It's got one button.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.240]   All you do is you swipe.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.640]   It's really a notification thing.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.140]   Exactly.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.040]   It's a notification thing.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:31.400]   It doesn't even--
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.120]   If you want to get to that--
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:32.400]   It's hard on it.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.360]   It doesn't ring.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.680]   And the order of the notifications
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.120]   isn't the same every time for different apps.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.200]   It's basically just a timeline.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:39.760]   I agree with you.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.600]   This is not-- I'm not saying, oh, this is the watch to get.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.320]   I think smart watches is a category, probably, or not.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:45.800]   No.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.000]   I don't have fan of smart watches.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   You know, they're also--
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.040]   I don't see a lot of people still wearing smart watches.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.840]   Oh, stop it.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.240]   The whole audience is going, I don't like--
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.160]   Everyone in the audience is like, a bomb.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.040]   They got like three on.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.040]   Our audience is almost always have Apple.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.760]   I'm looking forward to watch OS3,
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.240]   because it does look as though they paid attention
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.680]   to a lot of the criticism that they got.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.200]   It's faster.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.280]   It's faster, and they totally changed the user interface.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:09.920]   And they've--
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.440]   And they've--
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   And that app tray now.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.000]   They've just slimmed it down.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.480]   They needed to.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.440]   Yeah, but I never need to get an Uber from my watch
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:18.560]   when I can't get out my phone with a better, bigger screen.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.520]   It's more useful.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:19.920]   You know, that's--
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.040]   In some places, in some situations,
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.280]   you might not want to pull out your phone.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.520]   And calling a ride to the watch screen.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.880]   My Apple Watch is not an indicator that I have in my pocket
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.160]   at all, given that they link together.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:29.840]   It's all bright.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.840]   It's more like a--
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:31.360]   It's more like a little--
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.240]   Let me take this 10,000 nits.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.400]   The display out.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.000]   Oh.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.960]   So they have the displays brighter.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.640]   They've doubled the processor speed.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.040]   Battery life.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:40.040]   Battery life.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   Battery life.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:41.560]   Same.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.080]   Yeah, they didn't talk about battery life.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   Honestly, I don't know if you make it--
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.320]   I don't think the battery life is bad,
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.440]   but a lot of the more--
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.600]   They probably improved the battery life,
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.200]   but the display is brighter, so--
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:50.960]   And we have--
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.720]   We have like GPS.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.160]   If you leave the GPS on, you'll have a few hours.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.880]   They even say five hours.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.280]   It's all GPS on.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.200]   So that's why they didn't talk about battery life.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.800]   They don't want to say all the weasel words like,
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   unless you use a GPS, then it's only five hours.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.080]   But it's all on the site.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.160]   It's basically the same.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.480]   You charge it every night.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.200]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:08.800]   I'm OK with that.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.240]   I don't wear a watch every night.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.120]   So right now.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:15.360]   What do you think of the Nike Plus Watch?
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.120]   It's kind of ugly.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.240]   Not gonna lie.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.840]   I hate to be a hater, but I mean, that band is not attractive.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.720]   And I wonder how many runners are going to say, well, OK,
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.640]   I'll give up my runner's watch from Garmin or whoever.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.880]   And do this.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.320]   I just don't think they will.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.120]   I think this is more for--
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.720]   Nike Plus has been around forever.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.240]   It's been around forever.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.080]   Remember Tim Cooks on the Nike popular.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.320]   Tim, there's a very close relationship between Nike.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.240]   Oh, because he's on the board.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:38.720]   And Apple.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.280]   He's on the board.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.680]   They hired Jay Blonick from Nike.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.200]   They do their sports fitness stuff.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.120]   Now, there's a very close relationship between Apple
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   and Nike.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.360]   I think this watch isn't necessarily
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.840]   for the people who are super hardcore with the Garmin watches.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.440]   I think this is for the people who are using Nike.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.200]   They have a pretty app on their phone,
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.800]   maybe doing some running from time to time.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.040]   It's like, hey, here's an extension of what you're already
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:58:59.320]   doing.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.280]   Because the Nike Plus app, as you know,
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.600]   has been around for years, it's very popular.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:09.040]   You know, I think it's more for maybe someone
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.280]   who is serious about running, but maybe not
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.240]   like an Ironman triathlon person.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.720]   That's kind of like middle ground.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.280]   Like that above the person who's doing--
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.320]   That's inspirational.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.960]   Above us, but below a real hardcore.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.360]   You say above us mean like we don't do anything.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.800]   Well, okay, above people who are a little bit above us,
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.760]   so that weird middle ground.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.320]   That's like that's eight people in the dog.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.480]   Like someone who they work at like three times a week.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.560]   What do you mean?
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.160]   You know, maybe they run.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.760]   Is three times a week not enough?
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.600]   No, you have the regular Apple watch.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.680]   Like the person who's going to run seven days a week,
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.640]   but running isn't their entire life.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.240]   They don't have-- You run seven days a week
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.880]   and can do that running is your life.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.280]   OK.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.560]   I have to say I'm surprised because I've
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.920]   been baiting you guys like crazy.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.120]   And you guys are just not standing up and defending Apple
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:49.600]   at all.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.440]   Oh, right.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:53.600]   Why would I defend a company?
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   I think this is all--
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.600]   I defend Robbie and my cats.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.120]   Right on.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.440]   This is also a really easy thing for them to do.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.680]   The only difference really is the band.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.320]   The watch itself is the same.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.280]   It looks like there might be a specific watch face that
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.080]   goes along with it, which is very--
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.480]   But they do that with very as well.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.120]   Exactly.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.840]   Super, super simple.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.520]   I mean, you know, that band is the same fitness band.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.680]   It just has the holes drilled in it.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.120]   They do have some new features.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.920]   The watch will annoy you if you don't exercise sufficiently.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.560]   Because Fit shaming is lovely for your mental health.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.280]   Fit shaming?
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.240]   That's the word, isn't it?
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.520]   And it does match your Beats headphones.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.000]   OK, but if you're Apple and all you've
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.920]   added is waterproofing essentially to the device,
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.120]   what do you want to do to extend the announcement?
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.080]   You bring in Nike and you make a big splash out of it.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080]   I mean, literally a splash.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:33.080]   Get it?
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:33.580]   Splash.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.080]   Splash.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:34.580]   Come on.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:35.080]   Come on, Nate.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.160]   What you really do is you bring in Niantic and John
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.000]   Hanky, the CEO of Niantic Labs, to talk about Pokemon Go.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.160]   Pokemon Go.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:43.760]   Honestly, I'm--
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.600]   For hours.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.240]   I'm genuinely excited about that, because I
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.480]   feel like the Apple Watch--
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.600]   It's the perfect Pokemon Go?
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   It is kind of the perfect Pokemon.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.120]   It is.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:51.620]   It is.
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.880]   And the Apple Watch is by far the best
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.120]   smart watch you can buy.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.400]   That being said, it has no killer app.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.880]   It has no thing that you're just like, man, I need that.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.840]   I wish I had that.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.440]   I think you actually, for some people,
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.800]   Pokemon Go might be that thing.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   That's exactly Apple's strategy.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.840]   We need the killer app, but we need it
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.760]   in all these different verticals.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.800]   So they're trying to find the killer app in a dozen verticals.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.120]   And I think that that maybe is enough.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.600]   If you're a Pokemon Go fanatic, that
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.720]   might be enough to push you in.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.520]   If you're a runner or a swimmer, maybe that would push you in.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.920]   Because I mean, that's what the phone is.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.120]   The phone is like, it's good for this,
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.440]   but it's also good for this.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.360]   You can play games on my phone.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.520]   The phone feels like more of a general purpose thing
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.440]   though than the watch.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.360]   And I think they're trying to make the watch a little bit
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.680]   more general purpose, like slowly, but you can't--
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.440]   It's hard because it becomes complicated.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.000]   Think about it.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.640]   When the iPhone first came out, the killer app
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.320]   was you could have email and an interop browser.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.120]   And maps.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.240]   And then it was like Google Maps.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.560]   Wow, there's an app store.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.480]   And you have all these things.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.280]   I mean, the killer app was Angry Birds.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.480]   The killer app was Pokemon Go a few months ago.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.080]   The killer app--
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.960]   Turn by turn navigation used to be a paid feature on hardware.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:55.480]   Yes.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.280]   They brought that digital--
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:56.720]   Well, they showed that.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.200]   They sure killed that.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.240]   --that was insane.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.600]   Mobile browsing, mobile internet, better phone quality.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.120]   I mean, the original iPhone, even
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.280]   Sans, Thirapary Apps was incredible.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.040]   And we forget that.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.840]   But these are now launched with no real purpose, no real impact,
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.800]   such as to add things to them, a glom
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.160]   on features and feature sets.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.440]   And that's less impressive to me.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.440]   Tileo's pointed by the mouse cylinder very well.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:14.680]   Well--
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.120]   Not shot.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.480]   I do, by the way.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.400]   Not selling well for Apple means millions.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:18.920]   Right.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.400]   I mean--
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.760]   It's only free on the company in the world.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   I mean, it's not like people aren't buying them.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.400]   And obviously a lot of them are wild.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.960]   I do see a lot of Apple watches on the wild.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.400]   I mean, I travel pretty regularly for work
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.160]   and for some professional organizations on many things
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:33.960]   like that.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.520]   And I see a lot of people wearing these things in airports.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:36.960]   Do you?
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.440]   All right.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:38.960]   It's--
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.040]   I'll keep my eye on people.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.800]   I see way more Apple watches than let's say on Windows
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.000]   phones.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:44.360]   Oh.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.720]   Never see Windows phones.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.880]   You never see Windows phones.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.380]   All right.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.280]   I'll grab you that.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.040]   I'll grab you that.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.000]   Well, I'm going to--
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.200]   I do want to give--
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.000]   I'll give it another try with a series, too.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.960]   I have a one--
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.960]   not even a series one.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.800]   I have the original one.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.840]   Watch, yeah.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.960]   I do want to give Apple a little bit of props, though.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   I know you guys might totally slam me for this,
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.680]   but they didn't change the look of the Apple watch
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.960]   with a series, too.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.280]   They didn't--
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.200]   The bands still work.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.640]   The bands still work, all stuff.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.760]   And with the iPhone 7, it's the same length, width,
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.240]   and thickness as the iPhone 6 and 6s.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.720]   And we basically slam all of these companies,
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.880]   we being like tech press in general, not just the people
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.840]   seated here, for making thinner phones
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.200]   and not increasing battery life and not doing these things.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.080]   I think it's kind of nice to see a company just like keep
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.040]   a little bit of sameness, but add some things
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.120]   in the process.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.040]   I think that's what you're going to see from now on, right?
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:39.760]   I don't think people are--
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:39.760]   People are--
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.480]   People are-- keep saying, oh, next year,
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.200]   the 10th anniversary iPhone, that's
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.000]   going to--
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.160]   Apple's going to slow that speculation down,
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.600]   because what could they do that would make this 10th anniversary
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.280]   phone be, wow, what an improvement.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.360]   There's nothing more.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   They could put a keyboard on it.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.560]   They could put a wireless charging.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.240]   Wireless charging would be--
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.520]   Incredibly, no, but not just wireless--
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.920]   but really good wireless charging.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.480]   Everybody except Apple has wireless charging.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.440]   That would be incredible.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:02.960]   It's slow.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.600]   It's not very good.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:03.960]   Wireless charging is--
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.800]   And the problem is you can't make a metal phone
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.680]   with wireless charging.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.880]   You can make a heavy metal phone with wireless charging.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.400]   Boom.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.000]   Ooh, rock and roll.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.680]   Sorry, I'm running.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:17.280]   But there's another thing that's happening on the consumer side,
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.880]   which is we're holding on to our phones longer.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.800]   Because we're paying real prices.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.440]   We're not seeing-- we're seeing how much it actually comes.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.840]   I think that's also good, too.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.680]   I think the idea of tech companies--
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.120]   and hey, Wall Street would love this,
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.480]   but tech companies forcing us into buying a new phone
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.440]   every year, that's just--
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.000]   that's not a good idea for us.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   And it's not a cost effective.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.760]   It's not going for e-ways.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.400]   Although Apple does have that deal where you can pay monthly
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:44.600]   and get a new--
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.280]   They do have that.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.280]   But then they refurbish your phone
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.120]   and they sell those again.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.320]   No, I think that's appropriate.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.200]   So I think keeping those things going,
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.480]   that's better for the environment.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.600]   That's better for tech companies.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.720]   It's better for us.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.720]   So I think in the long run, this could all be really good stuff.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.920]   You guys didn't even mention the best feature
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:03.720]   about the Apple Watch, the squirting speaker.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.480]   It squirts us-- I mean, I made an appropriate joke
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.240]   on Twitter about it.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:07.840]   I'm shocked.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.640]   Everybody made an inappropriate joke on Twitter about it.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.240]   So those figures squirts out the--
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:12.760]   OK.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.280]   --now the pool and it's all--
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.520]   and it squirts out the water.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.000]   I mean, that's the main reason I bought one.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.320]   I just can't wait to see what that looks like.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:20.640]   OK.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.920]   You got to get some colored--
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.400]   I don't think it's actually good.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.520]   It's not going to know that you're standing and suddenly
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.040]   they just like--
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040]   Yes!
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:27.360]   What?
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.760]   It's like you shake your ear.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:28.760]   No.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.280]   No.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:29.800]   You shake your ear.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.760]   You go surfing or something.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.120]   You get all the water.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.080]   As I remember, they said, look, here's
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.280]   the one problem with waterproofing a watch.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.040]   Is the speaker.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.240]   You can't have a working speaker that doesn't let water in.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:46.080]   So we've solved this problem by creating a speaker that
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.840]   ejects the water when you get out of the water.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.440]   So it knows when you get out of the water.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:51.880]   It knows when you get out of the water.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.800]   And then the speaker must do a little--
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.240]   Must do a little--
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.280]   Must make a sound.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:57.280]   OK.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.200]   Sounds like it's not important here.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.800]   I think that sounds like a sound.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.520]   Also, if you go back in history to the original zoons,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520]   they had a feature that says--
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.560]   Long, second, fourth.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:07.360]   It's different.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.560]   That was squirting audio.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560]   It's also--
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560]   I don't even know.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560]   I don't even know.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560]   I call this ad.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.560]   They call it squirting audio.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.560]   Does it?
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.560]   I remember Steve Ballmer said it.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.560]   Why would they squirt?
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   No.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.560]   Because they're cold.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.560]   Oh, God.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560]   Microsoft.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560]   So I'm thinking it's just they play a sound that vibrates
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560]   the water out of there.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560]   Maybe there's a special ejection mechanism.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.560]   I hope it's like a fart noise.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.560]   [SNEEZING]
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.560]   It's a little water salt.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   Nice.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.560]   Do you see why I had to buy one?
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.560]   No.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560]   That's actually the killer feature.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.560]   Just like, look at this, guys.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.560]   Just put your hand in a bucket of water.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.560]   I will get the earpods as soon as there's a little bit of it.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560]   Because I think that's going to be interesting.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.560]   It's going to be frustrating as hell.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560]   You're going to hate them.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560]   You're going to lose them.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560]   The ear thing.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.560]   You know, I wonder if Apple's going to sell a lanyard--
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.560]   You know, like you'd wear--
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.560]   You know what would be cool?
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   --glasses, but for the heavy boots.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.560]   So is a lanyard?
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   And so it wouldn't get lost.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.560]   The lanyard was attached to your phone.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.560]   You're just quoting Johnny's son now.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.560]   You're awesome.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   You're awesome.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560]   That's great.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560]   That's a great idea.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560]   You stole that tween real life.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   I did.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.560]   I stole it.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.560]   I don't know who said it, but--
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.560]   You just have some sort of attachment that you can do on the phone that that way.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560]   If you can attach to your phone.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.560]   If you drop the earpods, the earpods--
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.560]   Like you could drill a hole in it and just shove it in there so it would anchor it.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   That's a great idea.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.560]   Now that's innovation.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.560]   In a couple of years, I'll probably actually make audio go through that lanyard hole.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.560]   On your higher finality?
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.560]   No, no, no, no, no, you're crazy.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.560]   Now you're crazy talk.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.560]   Higher.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   Maybe you can even help you charge the headphones.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.560]   Oh.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.560]   Ooh.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.560]   Camera?
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.960]   Do we want to say anything about the camera?
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.560]   No, let's take a break and we'll talk about the camera when we come back.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.080]   It's not the first phone with dual cameras.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.040]   Somebody had an LG G5 in here yesterday.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.480]   They did exactly the same thing.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.400]   Two lenses, wide and telephoto.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.400]   You have a button on the screen, switches back and forth.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.400]   It's been done.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.000]   But Apple did it again.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.360]   And this time they got it right.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.440]   Our show.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.600]   Our show today.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.240]   I don't hate Apple.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.120]   I buy everything they make.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   Buy everything they make.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.120]   I don't hate them.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.120]   I don't think anyone said anyone.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.240]   I think I completely crystallized my point of view earlier in the show when I said you
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:17.720]   want them to be the company that they were for so many years, the innovator changing
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.000]   the world.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.120]   And then it's hard as a journalist to look at what they've done and decide is that going
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.200]   to change the world?
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:32.640]   Or is that just a profit-making machine designed to squeeze money out of us?
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:38.000]   Well, you know, there's always some, like most companies in the existence of the world
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.240]   have maybe changed the world zero times.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.240]   That's true.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.960]   Or if you're lucky once.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960]   No, right.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.960]   I have an amazing track record.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.280]   And you could argue that Apple kind of did that with the Mac.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.040]   Definitely did that with the iPod and it's done with the iPhone.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.080]   Maybe it's the iPad.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:09:23.080]   So even if you take that away, let's say J-J-J-J-J-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:29.120]   My point is, is Apple's already changed many things, revolutionized many things.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.600]   I hate using these words, but way more than almost any other company.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.120]   And next year, as I was saying, they're going to do the Apple File System, the new APF,
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.120]   which is frankly huge.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.960]   Going to be the first time mainstream users have had access to the kind of File System
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.040]   technology others have had with ZFS and BTFS.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.040]   BTFS.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040]   They can't do this every year.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.040]   That's going to be huge.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.040]   The users are going to go, "Wow, my data is..."
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.040]   Don't lose data anymore.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.040]   It's going to be big.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.040]   I think to your point, what I'll last and I'll say is, we shouldn't have to have a brand
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.440]   new, complete new phone every year.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   Yes.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.840]   But if the price is going to persist at the exact same price point or go up, I guess
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.840]   it did this time, then I do higher expectations.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.360]   I thought the SP went up by 20 or 40, am I wrong?
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.360]   No, it's the exact same.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.360]   Well, it's more than a factor than an Apple.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.360]   It's more than a K-Gig.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360]   It's the pound as well.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.480]   They don't have a 16 gig version anymore.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.280]   But the 32 gig version is still 649.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.280]   Yeah, same price.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.040]   What was the 16 gigabyte one before?
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.040]   649.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.040]   Okay.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.040]   I retract the complaint.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.040]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:33.960]   And their competitors are making things that are very similar that are maybe a little bit
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.280]   more accessible a little more affordable than the Note 7.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.280]   We come back.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.280]   Okay.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280]   Yes, start to talk about that.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.280]   That was a commercial break.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.020]   No, I want to talk about right now Eggplant and Chickpea Chitajean with Islander Pepper,
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.020]   Tomato, and Cuscoos.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.020]   How about that for dinner?
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.020]   Do you like that tonight?
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.020]   I'm cooking.
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.020]   I don't like Eggplant.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.020]   It says no.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.020]   No, no, no.
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.020]   Oh, you're a vegetarian?
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:57.620]   How about summer udon noodle salad with cherry tomatoes, corn, and summer sweet pepper?
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.620]   I love that.
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:10:59.620]   I love that.
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.620]   I love it.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:01.620]   It's spicy.
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.620]   Who is so underrated?
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.620]   Romy gets all the props.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.620]   I know.
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:05.620]   It's good.
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.620]   It's a good noodle.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.620]   I tell people.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:10.900]   How about spicy hoisin chicken stir fry with baby bok choy and sesame ginger cucumber salad?
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.540]   This is what's in my Blue Apron box this week.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.340]   Blue Apron delivers a box to me every week.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:24.740]   Refrigerated with fresh meats, vegetables, the best stuff from local farms, and in it,
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.620]   every exact ingredient I need and not one more.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:29.980]   If I need one clove of garlic, it's got one clove of garlic.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.620]   There's no waste.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.580]   And then it's got a recipe card and I can cook this meal and it's amazing.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.580]   It's amazing.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:41.420]   Blue Apron, their mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone while supporting
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:45.900]   a more sustainable food system, setting the highest standards for ingredients.
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.540]   And to me, this is the most important building a community of home chefs.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.540]   I know it's hard.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.540]   You get home from work.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.540]   You've been working all day.
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:57.940]   Last thing you want to do is plan a meal, shop for a meal, come home and cook the meal.
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:01.060]   So when you've got that Blue Apron box on your doorstep and it's there and you're going
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.780]   to make this amazing meal in 40 minutes, you're going to be eating, everybody's going to say,
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.780]   "This is incredible.
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.180]   I never had anything so good."
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.140]   You're going to use ingredients that you've never used before, like Udon.
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.780]   You're going to say, "Oh, no more ramen for me.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.660]   I got Udon, baby."
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.740]   And the next time you'll know how to cook it.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.780]   So it's really, it's like a cooking class in the box.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.380]   I love Blue Apron.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.980]   And by the way, this will cost you less than shopping for yourself because they don't have
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:25.980]   the brick and mortars.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:26.980]   They don't have the clicks.
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:30.540]   It's 60% more expensive to buy at a grocery store than to go to Blue Apron.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:36.260]   And it's a lot less expensive than buying a lesser meal at a restaurant.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.700]   Don't, you've got to stop going in now, guys.
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:41.140]   You got to get Blue Apron.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:47.340]   So let me recommend it and tell you how you can get three meals free if you go to Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.660]   Take a look at the menu.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.220]   You get to pick what you're going to have.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.580]   Korean, I love Korean pork tacos.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.580]   Love them.
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:54.580]   Ooh.
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:59.180]   See, when I look at the menus and I see what they've got, I'm thinking, "I've got to have
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.180]   that."
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.180]   It's so good.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.980]   And it's fun to make it yourself and the house smells great.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.660]   Go to Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:11.100]   You're going to love how good it feels, how it tastes to create incredible home-cooked
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.860]   meals with Blue Apron.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:15.340]   And your first three meals are free with free shipping.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:17.900]   They delivered 99% of the continental United States.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.620]   I'm sorry, Alaska.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.620]   Nope.
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.780]   No Blue Apron for you.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.020]   Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:31.540]   We thank them so much for their support of our show and for making amazing meals.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.540]   I chickened out.
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.380]   I was going to brave it out.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.300]   This is courage.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.540]   I was going to keep my note seven.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.540]   And continue to use it.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.540]   Oh.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.540]   Living on the wild side.
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:47.340]   You're going to wear like oven mitts and like, "It never had.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.740]   It never got hot.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:49.740]   I quick-charged it.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.220]   Nothing went wrong.
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.780]   I thought I'm just going to keep it."
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:58.300]   But then I got scared because first of all, the airline starts saying, "Well, you can't
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.460]   fly with that thing."
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.100]   In Australia, the FAA.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.100]   What do airlines like?
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.380]   You can't take this thing on the plane.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.380]   You're like, "Oh, well."
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.380]   Nope.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:11.900]   Samsung says only one in -- I've heard two numbers.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.900]   32,000 or one in 41,000 phones have this bad battery.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:18.780]   It's by the way, ironic because Samsung was outsourcing the battery with Chinese company.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:19.780]   Those were fine.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:24.700]   It's the one Samsung made themselves apparently that have the problem.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:28.220]   But it's only a total out of two and a half million.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.940]   What is two and a half million divided by 42,000?
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.940]   Anybody?
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:31.940]   Anybody?
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:32.940]   It's like a 45 million.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.300]   It's like a few hundred, right?
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.300]   Wait.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.300]   Come on.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.300]   You already have 35 incidents.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.140]   Five million divided by 41,000.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.140]   Nine.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.140]   No, it's 61.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.140]   61.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.580]   So, they've already been 35 fires.
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.220]   There's only 26 left.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.220]   There's only 20,000 left.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.220]   What did it change?
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.220]   It's closing.
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.220]   What did it do?
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.220]   It's literally two ones.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.220]   Samsung.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:56.220]   It's literally one in 250,000 that I'd have one of those phones.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.940]   You're just -- knowing your luck, you wouldn't.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.940]   Aw.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.780]   Well, the other thing is I'm going on vacation next week.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:03.260]   I'm getting in a not only planes, but I'm getting in a cruise ship where I will have
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:04.260]   to charge that phone.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.260]   And if the cruise ship burnt to the ground --
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:07.260]   To the sea.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:08.260]   I would feel better.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.260]   I would feel pretty bad.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.260]   If it burnt to the ground, that would be impressive.
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:15.260]   It burned the entire ocean away as well.
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.780]   So, I chickened out.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:21.260]   And by the way, I've read Christina Warren's pieces at Kismoto.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:24.260]   Yeah, I almost said Mashable at Kismoto.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.420]   Where she's saying it's a real mess people were trained by.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.420]   I got it from T-Mobile.
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.420]   Brought it to T-Mobile.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:34.660]   The guy looked at the back and said, "Well, you know, this one was made in China, so the
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:37.180]   chances are it is not one of the problem phones."
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.780]   I said, "Are you recommending a not turn it in?"
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:42.460]   He said, "No, you should turn it in."
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.860]   And they just credit my credit card for the full 850 bucks.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.940]   Oh, they didn't give you like a loaner or something like that?
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.700]   Well, you have a choice.
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.540]   It depends on your carrier, but I think in most cases you can either turn it in and then
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.780]   when they get new Note 7s.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:59.780]   By the way, the new Note 7s apparently have a sticker with an S for safe on them.
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:00.780]   Oh, man.
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:03.780]   So, is it a sticker or they got like actually like engraved it?
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.780]   Because it made cool if it was like engraved.
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:06.780]   Like this is such a...
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.780]   Safe.
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.780]   Well, they have.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.780]   They maybe they do because...
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:10.780]   Because you get on a plane.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:11.780]   You're like, "How do you know?"
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.780]   "How do you know?"
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.340]   "No, I have to say it's safe."
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.140]   Yeah, I got the Star Bear Leads.
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:18.420]   Just get a shot at me and just draw it yourself.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.740]   So, you can do that or which I suspect no one will do.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.180]   If you want, you can get in that...
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:29.140]   In some cases a Galaxy S7, in some cases a cheesy Samsung phone loaner until the Note
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.140]   7 comes out.
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:31.580]   Not a good one.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.580]   Or you can get your money back.
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:33.580]   It's like a flip phone.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.380]   Everyone's offering a $25 credit to anybody who does this.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.700]   So you get some compensation.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.860]   I bought a cheap case.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.860]   So that would be nice.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.860]   It's 25 months.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.860]   But they were...
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.500]   I have to give them credit.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.300]   They did the right thing.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.300]   They stepped up, right?
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:51.540]   Eventually they even contacted the CPSC and made an official recall.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.580]   They did a very good job on the recall and a very bad job leading up to that by making
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.580]   the mistake.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:58.580]   So, my real curiosity is will this cost their brand long term?
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.580]   I think so.
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.980]   Because the short term financial impact me can just measure.
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.020]   But I'm curious about the long term loss of brand equity and therefore loss of each
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.020]   or so.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:10.020]   Well, how many people are going to turn it in and then say I'll take another one?
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.020]   Are you?
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.020]   Well, I mean, here's...
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.020]   What do you got to think about?
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.020]   Remember...
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.020]   No, you know what I'm doing?
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.020]   I'm buying an iPhone.
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.020]   Remember when...
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:18.020]   My man.
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.020]   Power Mac or Power Books were catching on fire.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.020]   The 5,300.
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:21.020]   Oh, this is happened.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.020]   To Apple.
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:23.020]   It's happened to Power Books.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:24.020]   It's happened to Toshiba.
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:25.020]   It's happened to Dell.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.660]   Did that hurt them?
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.220]   I mean, they were already in a bad shape at that point during the '90s.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.220]   But did that hurt them even more?
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.140]   They sold 2.5 million Note 7s.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:36.100]   This was the flagship Samsung.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.100]   You've seen very graphic video.
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:42.340]   See, you have 2.5 million people like me like...
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.620]   I think this is the first one.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.620]   This is the first one.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:45.620]   This is the most...
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.620]   No one's for the most.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.620]   There's the initial cost which is estimated to be 1.5 billion.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.060]   And then I think there's long term cost.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:54.180]   I even think there's long term cost of lithium ion battery technology.
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:56.220]   Well, there's nothing to replace that right now.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.220]   Yeah, lithium...
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.220]   Yeah, there's something...
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.700]   But look, you know, I think it is coming on the hoverboard thing.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.540]   Now this is a 1.2 punch.
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:07.500]   People are thinking, "Should I bring these things into my house?"
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.700]   These are dangerous.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.260]   You think people will just go, "Well, I gotta live with it."
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:18.060]   I think it's going to come down to what compelling devices other companies come to choice.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.700]   I think it's going to be awesome.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.060]   I'm driving a giant bomb with a ton of lithium ion batteries.
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.060]   So that's the thing.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:29.100]   I think it's going to be an awesome fodder for the six o'clock news, like local six o'clock
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.100]   news.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:33.260]   Everything in your house will explode because of lithium ion batteries.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.740]   Tune in at 6PS when...
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.740]   Yes, true.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.020]   But if you just know how batteries work in general, like...
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.020]   It's dangerous.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.020]   If they're punctured?
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.020]   Exactly.
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:47.460]   All of these things can catch on fire if you do it the right way, right?
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:55.140]   So, I think the issue really comes down to, you know, like how quickly is Samsung going
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.020]   to bring out these new phones that work and repair it?
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.420]   Because it's taken a while.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.340]   I mean, it's...
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:06.220]   They had their voluntary recall, then they talked to all the carriers, then the FAA came
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:11.580]   out and did their thing, the Australian Airlines authority banned the phones.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.060]   And now they're working with the CPSC on an official recall.
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:19.060]   So they kind of got out a little bit ahead of it, but at the same time, it's starting
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.220]   to drag out.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:24.540]   And now what we're hearing is not just that it's been recalled, but now that there's another
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.940]   authority, another body that you should be listening to that is also saying, "Yeah,
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:32.460]   by the way, take that phone back if you haven't already.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:36.860]   Yeah, by the way, don't want to take that on an airplane, don't charge it, don't use
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:37.860]   it."
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:38.860]   I mean, it's just kind of being counted.
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:43.020]   Was it a stereotype if only 68 phones in the whole world had this problem?
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.020]   Yes.
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.020]   I was...
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.020]   That's the thing.
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.300]   It's that really confident that my Note 7 was fine.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.460]   I never got on.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.140]   I was sure I was fine.
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:52.980]   But at the minute, the airline said, "Well, you can't get..."
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.060]   I mean, they're literally telling people the gate.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.980]   If you have a Note 7, you may not put it in your check luggage, you must carry it on,
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.060]   you must not turn it on, you must not charge it.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:06.180]   Well, if they would have known that that's 68 of them leaving the factory or in good shape,
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.540]   when they all left with the quality checks, they all looked to be legit.
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.900]   They have quality checks in place when they're building these devices.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.860]   One question is probably such a small number, right?
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:15.860]   Well, probably...
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:18.980]   They're going to have, they say, an IMEI database where people will be able to look up their
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:19.980]   phone.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:20.980]   Exactly.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:25.020]   Okay, the question is, oh, it was only 68, it's probably not going to happen.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.420]   It's like, if one of those things goes off, it'll play.
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.420]   I don't want it to be me.
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:29.420]   Exactly.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:30.420]   I know.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.420]   Like, it's not...
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:33.740]   Or take out a plane, kill 300 people, and all of a sudden Samsung's phone kills, you
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:34.740]   know.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:35.740]   Exactly.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.820]   So all it takes is one in the right place to go off.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:38.820]   I feel...
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:39.820]   And then it's a big problem.
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:40.820]   Okay.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.300]   I'm disappointed because I actually love the phone.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.300]   It's a really nice phone.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.300]   Great.
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.980]   It's one of the best phone sounds I've ever made.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.060]   And I'm probably not going to get another one.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.260]   So I went ahead and pulled the math and did the currency conversions to figure this out,
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:52.260]   but 1.5...
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.260]   That's why I went for two minutes.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.500]   It was like, hold on, everybody.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.500]   I got maths.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.500]   I haven't actually verified this.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.500]   That's a dunking math.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.140]   That's about 2% of their ready cash right now is $1.5 billion.
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:03.620]   So the loss here from a gross cash forward.
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:05.260]   From a gross cash review, yes they can.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.260]   But it's still enough money.
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:09.140]   It's going to screw up a lot of divisions operating profits and it's going to look very
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.140]   bad.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.060]   So the short-term financial impact, doable long-term brand, I leave the raw.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:14.580]   Well, it could sell or hold.
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:17.340]   This could be like the Ford Pino for Samsung.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.340]   It's like a pun.
[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.340]   It's going to take us a good example.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.340]   There's a good example.
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:25.460]   It might take a few years for them to sort of like get back forward.
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:26.700]   People still talk about that.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:27.700]   That really hurt.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:30.500]   Well, I mean like people my age, I'm older.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.500]   How old are you Robbie?
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   I'm 57.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.500]   Aside from that.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.500]   I'm not.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.500]   You're both.
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.500]   Irable liars.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:37.500]   Is 57 old?
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:38.500]   No.
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.500]   Yes.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.500]   Anything over 23 is old.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.500]   Yes.
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.500]   That's correct.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.500]   That's correct.
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.500]   Anything over 23 is old.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.300]   If you're 27 and you're like, I'm 10.
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:47.300]   You're a liar.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.300]   So there's liars.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.300]   I'm 27.
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:50.460]   Society is lied to you.
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:51.460]   You're old.
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.100]   They told me that 57 was the new 30.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.100]   Yeah, those people lied.
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.580]   It's all right.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:58.940]   Just be happy at what age you are.
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:21:59.940]   Yeah, I made it.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:00.940]   I love how they are in chat.
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:01.940]   You're a little better than the alternative.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.380]   He's not 57.
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:04.380]   They believe in this guy's alternative.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.380]   They believe in this guy's alternative.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:06.380]   How old do you guys think I am?
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:07.380]   Irable.
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.380]   He's 32.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:12.380]   I think this can be a black guy who's Samsung and it's going to be a big guy.
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:16.380]   I'm going dancing.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.300]   We're going on a tangent here.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.300]   Stick to the script, guys.
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.300]   Samsung.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:22.300]   It's like a third grade when you shout out about a teacher.
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.740]   Don't eat crayons.
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.740]   I'm sad about it.
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:27.740]   It's a bummer.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:28.740]   It's a couple of years.
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:29.740]   It's a bad thing for Samsung.
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:33.020]   It's a couple of years of Samsung being the butt of a lot of jokes.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:37.580]   But it might be an opportunity for LG or Huawei or--
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.580]   Oh, it's an opposite.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:39.580]   You know, it's not an opposite.
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:40.580]   You make a couch on that.
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:43.340]   It's no accident that the exact amount of money you get back at T-Mobile is what it would
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.780]   cost to say, well, I'll take an iPhone instead.
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.780]   You got it.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:48.780]   A lot of those people are on the phone.
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.780]   They have the love of this right now.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.780]   Oh, this is totally perfect.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:54.820]   Shame, because what took the air out of all the complaints that we were making, this saga
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:55.820]   is huge.
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:56.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.420]   And now, as Roby said, Samsung is the peach emoji of the smartphone world.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.420]   Yeah, they're going to--
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   You know what?
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:06.060]   I don't have a headphone port, but it's not going to blow up in my hand.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.060]   Yeah, I'll get the out of the joke.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:08.060]   Does that turn around?
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:09.060]   I don't know.
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.060]   I don't know.
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.060]   As long as you don't say it's the eggplant.
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:12.060]   I--
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.260]   Yes, see, I know my emoji's buddy.
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.340]   I mean, I'm not--
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.500]   Just because I'm in my 50s.
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.660]   You're more hip than I am and always have been.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.580]   Yeah, we're done.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.220]   We had a great week on Twit talking about all this stuff and we have a little mini movie
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:29.180]   we made just for your delectation in case you missed a minute watch.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.260]   Previously on Twit.
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.220]   Thinking about doing something nutty, I don't know if you heard Windows Weekly earlier,
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.380]   but Mary Jo Foley convinced me maybe not to bring any technology with me.
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.860]   This did not last for you.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.460]   You sound skeptical.
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.900]   I know, sweetheart.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.660]   Could Microsoft have won a mobile market?
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:52.340]   The Apple Envy that drove Microsoft during this period of time was so strong that they
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:57.420]   literally followed Apple down this consumer rabbit hole and tried to make a consumer product.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:01.460]   After they had failed with Zoom, after they had failed with Windows Media Center, they
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.100]   still tried.
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:06.780]   And that is astonishing to me.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:13.780]   It's not a security now.
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:17.780]   Yawty, yet another way to track you.
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:20.580]   It is now possible for a web page to determine the exact color and amount of light which your
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.500]   phone is exposed to.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:29.460]   If that's code running in an ad and you then go from one site to another, oh, you know,
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:34.420]   we weren't sure if this was the same guy, but look exactly the same amount of red, green
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.420]   and blue.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.420]   Probably is.
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:37.420]   Twit.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.420]   Now in color.
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:42.420]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.420]   I don't know either way.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.260]   I'll tell you, Steve Gibson, he's a wild one.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.300]   Let's see what's coming up the week ahead.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.660]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:55.460]   Here are a few things that we'll be keeping a close eye on in the week ahead, starting
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.940]   Monday, September 12th.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.540]   Tech Crunch Disrupt kicks off in San Francisco, and I'll actually be there with a crew with
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:06.260]   Kara, of course, and a few others chatting with some of the startups and innovators who
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.900]   are showing off their hard work at the event.
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:14.380]   Also on the 12th, Google will officially discontinue its Google+ Hangouts on air service
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:15.380]   that have no fear.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:21.620]   Creators can transition over to YouTube live relatively easy and keep their live streams
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.860]   going over there.
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:28.780]   On Tuesday, September 13th, Apple will unleash its updated iOS 10 to salivating fans the
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:29.940]   world over.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:36.460]   On Thursday, September 15th, Sony is launching its newly announced PS4 Slim for $2.99, which
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:41.980]   is nearly identical to its full-size brethren, along with an updated DualShock 4 controller
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:43.900]   and redesigned light bar.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:49.580]   And on Friday, September 16th, let the reign of new Apple devices commence as the big Kohuna,
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:55.780]   the Apple iPhone 7 series, begins shipping to those who pre-ordered their own new favorite
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.780]   toy.
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:01.380]   So Apple will be selling its new Apple Watch Series 2 and launching the updated Watch
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:04.300]   OS 3 for owners of the original model.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:07.140]   So many toys, so little time.
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:11.420]   You know that Mega Moroni and I will talk about all this stuff and a whole lot more all
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.060]   week on Tech News today, so don't miss it.
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:15.260]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.260]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.260]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.140]   We'll do an unboxing of the gold iPhone on Friday.
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.900]   You sound so disappointed.
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.340]   Well we can look at the camera.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:32.900]   Two cameras, one wide-angle 28mm effective, 156mm, which is not telephoto, but it's twice
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:35.300]   as close.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:40.500]   And then Apple said, "And as extra credit, we're going to have Boca in the new camera,
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.500]   but it won't be till later."
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.460]   Yeah, we're still working on that.
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:48.140]   It looks like it could be cool, but we won't know until later.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.060]   It's faux, we call it Foca.
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.060]   It's Foca.
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.220]   Yeah, but it still looks pretty nice.
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:56.020]   I wish I could give credit to whoever came up with that term.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.860]   It's really good.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.260]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:03.900]   If you like me, you like reading.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:08.260]   I tell you, I didn't read as much as I would like to once I, you know, you get out of college
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.460]   and you start working for a living.
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:11.460]   You don't have as much time.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:14.940]   You get home, you want to read, you're sleepy, you go to sleep, the book falls on your nose.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:15.940]   It hurts.
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:16.940]   You never do that again.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.460]   Then along came Audible.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.460]   And I had a lot of time in the car every day.
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:24.940]   I was commuting and Audible books meant that the two hours I spent in the car every day,
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.220]   I was two hours of reading and it changed my life.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.300]   I've been an Audible subscriber since the year 2000.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:35.540]   And I've got hundreds of books on my virtual Audible shelf.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:38.020]   I invite you to give Audible a try.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:42.580]   It really is a fantastic place to get audio entertainment.
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:48.500]   Fiction and nonfiction, college courses, they have the great courses, which are phenomenal.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.100]   It really makes you feel like you're learning something.
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:51.100]   I love that.
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.780]   They've got comedy performances, they've got speeches.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:58.100]   There's a lot of audio content waiting for you at Audible.com.
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:01.040]   You can buy it on a car, but the best way, the way I do it and the way I've done it ever
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:06.220]   since the year 2000 is by subscription, you can get, I have the two books a month subscription.
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:09.900]   It's just kind of nice because I don't often don't get to two books a month, but I have
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:10.900]   kind of a backlog.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.980]   And then when I go on a trip, I've got stuff to read.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.660]   I'm pretty excited about that.
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:19.660]   I really suggest you that I read that blue God in before I go to Russia.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:23.100]   So I'm reading the Master in the Margarita, which is a classic Russian novel.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.300]   It's quite good.
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.980]   And because I'm listening to it on Audible, I'm also getting the benefit of a really good
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.820]   reader who's bringing the book to life.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.780]   And with Russian names, that's helpful.
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.700]   Because that's sometimes a little confusing.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:37.500]   You may not know whether you're ready for audio books.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:41.220]   I think a lot of people think, well, I don't know if I could I listen to a book and really
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.780]   understand it and hear it.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.780]   So this is what we're going to do.
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:45.380]   We're going to give you two books free.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:48.180]   I'll give you a chance to see what you think.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:52.900]   Whether you're reading a textbook like the Steve Jobs biography, actually several on Audible.com
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:54.620]   that I read and I'm really, really good.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.300]   I think becoming Steve Jobs is the one I'd recommend.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:01.260]   Or funny books, John Hodgeman and Amy Poehler.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.420]   I just I love those.
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.300]   And often when it's a comic, the comics will read those.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.820]   And it's just like getting a performance in your car.
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:10.820]   Here's the deal.
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:11.820]   Go to Audible.com/twit2.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:14.740]   You're going to be sending out for the platinum plan.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:17.700]   That's my plan, which is two books a month.
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.620]   But you have the first month is free.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:23.860]   So you can get those two books and cancel anytime in the first 30 days, but you can keep
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.860]   them.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:28.660]   You'll also get the daily digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:33.620]   If you drive, if you work out at the gym, mostly for me now it's at the gym or taking
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:36.900]   walks, I like to listen to audiobooks.
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.620]   Audible is awesome.
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:44.860]   Go to Audible.com/twit and the number two to get your two books free.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:49.140]   Audible.com/twit and the number two to the offer is good in the US and Canada.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:53.420]   But if you're outside that area, I have lots of Australians in the studio audience today.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.220]   Don't worry, Audible's there too.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.220]   Hello.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:02.740]   And a great, by the way, you got to assault your son is with you, young adult.
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:07.500]   Research shows that young adults and children who listen to audiobooks read sooner and
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.500]   read more.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.940]   You might think, oh, they're not going to read because they're listening, but it gets them
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:12.460]   excited about books.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:17.580]   So whenever my kids had a reading assignment, we'd always get the audiobook.
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.860]   Whenever we went on a family trip, we'd always get an audiobook.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:24.460]   And it's a great way to be together, to listen, to talk about fiction, nonfiction.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.460]   It's fun.
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.940]   Audible.com/twit to give it a try today.
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:31.940]   Your first two free and Audible.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:34.740]   I guess October 4th, Google's going to have an announcement.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:35.740]   Is it?
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:36.740]   Are we done?
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.340]   Oh, Pixel, whatever, Nexus.
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:40.700]   Do we care?
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.220]   I still care, but I don't know.
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:43.220]   I like the idea.
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.220]   I stuff.
[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.100]   Yeah, I'm going to come to the Android.
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.100]   Any Android device that gets an update.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.300]   As soon as it's ready.
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:51.180]   Well, that's really a good point.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.740]   That's the only Android device I want to get.
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.820]   I don't want to get like the compelling reason to not buy anything but Google devices.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:58.820]   Yeah, but Nexus devices.
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.300]   Because you have stage fright, you have all these security issues.
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.220]   Well, there's no one using an observable one.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:05.860]   The new one with the, what was it, the--
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.540]   Mars Technica was writing about it.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:08.900]   It's actually kind of scary.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:13.900]   It's not only are they malicious, they're critical bugs, but there are already apps in
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:18.580]   the app store discovered that take advantage of them.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:22.340]   Now whenever Google discovers these, of course, they remove from the app store, but the fact
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:26.860]   that they got into the app store and they think they estimate as many as two and a half
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.620]   million people have downloaded malicious apps.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.700]   Wow.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:34.820]   And even if at this point, even if you have a Nexus, you're not protected because the
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:38.700]   patch for this comes out in the September update, which is a check, but I've been checking
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:39.700]   all day.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:40.700]   It's not out yet.
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:43.500]   So I have a 6P if you have a 5X or 6P.
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:47.700]   Even with a Google phone, you're vulnerable to this bug, which was discovered by Google
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:53.940]   that allows attackers to execute malware or escalate local privileges on vulnerable phones.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:59.780]   By the way, every Android device in existence is currently vulnerable except for the ones
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:03.220]   inside Google that got the September patch already.
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:07.980]   It can be exploited in a large variety of ways, including sending you a JPEG.
[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:10.260]   So a bad guy could text you a JPEG.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:12.060]   Hey, here's a picture.
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:13.060]   Oh, okay.
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:17.620]   You've never, here's, here's a bird up balding as you've never seen him before.
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.260]   And you're going to close the app.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:20.940]   Who would have got to see that?
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.580]   And you open it and boom.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.580]   You're bad.
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:26.820]   You could, you could also embed it in an MP4 file.
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:29.660]   There's all sorts of ways to, to do this.
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:34.300]   So it's the ex-if data in the image can contain the vulnerability.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.900]   It is a really, really bad one.
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:40.660]   Now I have to point out Apple had a similarly bad vulnerability last month.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:44.300]   This is, look at any operating system is going to have bugs.
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:48.700]   And people are working, there's a lot of money to be made as we know now that Israeli
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:51.780]   group that made millions of dollars selling in the...
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:53.820]   Exploit merchants are living the dream.
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:57.460]   So that means they're working hard to find the next half million dollar bug, right?
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:32:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:01.820]   And they had the million dollar bounty for an iOS bug.
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:03.820]   And they paid it.
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:04.820]   Not because they're going to tell Apple.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.820]   No, no, no, they're going to sell it.
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:10.700]   They're going to sell it to nation states and some of the more horrible.
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.700]   The various merchants, ex-plate merchants are going to sell it to whoever.
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.100]   They'll sell it to other companies.
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:24.820]   They'll sell it to maybe some nations that have a pretty scary human rights track record.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:28.420]   You know, I think you're, at this point you're just hoping that nobody's going after you.
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.620]   But here's an example.
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:34.780]   One of the exploits is called call jam.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:38.460]   And it was embedded into an app called gems chest for clash royale.
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:39.980]   Clash royale is the best selling game.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.500]   I presume Jim's chest is not actually an official game?
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:47.980]   No, it's one of those things where here you get some free gems for your clash royale.
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:49.460]   Yeah, don't do that by the way.
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:50.460]   Don't do that.
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:54.860]   You should know better, but a hundred thousand to half a million people fell for it.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:55.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:59.940]   Now, of course, immediately, as soon as Google finds out about this, they remove them.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:04.860]   The Google also has a scanner on your Android device that scans for known exploits.
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:11.500]   So I'm hoping that people didn't get bit by this, but dress code, which is another exploit,
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:17.500]   was used probably to generate fraudulent clicks on ads, but it could be used in a more malicious
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.500]   way.
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.780]   Because if you're, it's pushing you to click on something that means it could push on
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.500]   you to click on something that has malware.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.500]   The malware gets to your phone.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:25.500]   Yep.
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:30.420]   Now malware gets installed on your phone and now get this 40 Google Play apps containing
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:33.860]   dress code downloaded from half a million to two million times.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:35.860]   Wow.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:36.860]   That's super bad.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:40.100]   It does happen on every operating system, like you mentioned, but on the mobile side,
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:44.620]   at least it happens on Android a lot more than what happens on iOS.
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:49.020]   And Google's really good about addressing things quickly, but because there are so many Android
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:54.980]   devices out there and because so few get the software updates from Google.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:55.980]   Yes.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:01.180]   It's just a major problem unless the safest thing you can do as an Android user is using
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:04.380]   an excess device is using a Google device.
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:07.020]   Samsung and BlackBerry have been keeping up with some of their updates.
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:12.860]   Well, Samsung and LG have supposedly committed, and this is what I think you're going to look
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.860]   for committed to taking the monthly security updates.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:16.860]   Yes.
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:20.020]   So you're probably okay with Samsung and LG.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:22.780]   Surprisingly Motorola has not yet committed.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:27.460]   There are a lot of really nice inexpensive phones like the Axon 7, the OnePlus 3, the
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.340]   new Honor A from Huawei.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:32.860]   None of those companies have agreed to take the updates.
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.100]   It doesn't mean they won't.
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:35.980]   It's just they're not committing to.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:39.140]   So at this point, I think you go with, you go with, well, what's called Nexus, I guess
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:41.900]   it's going to be called Pixel, but you go with a Google phone because at least you know
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:43.820]   they'll get it before anybody else does.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:49.060]   And you know, it's, it's, I feel like it's something that not a lot of folks, you know,
[01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:50.060]   realize.
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:55.820]   It's not a matter of taste, but I feel like the Nexus devices with unaltered Android,
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:57.220]   it's always the best Android user experience.
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:00.620]   It's a good experience from software point of view, but they rarely the same as good
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.620]   hardware as Samsung and others may.
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:03.540]   That's totally fair.
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:04.780]   That's totally fair.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:09.140]   Software matters to me, and Samsung's getting a lot better with it in previous years.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:11.220]   They couldn't stand their versions of Android.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.220]   Right.
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:13.820]   Now, I think, you know, they're getting pretty good.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.820]   No, it's pretty light.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:17.660]   And so the Axon is the OnePlus 3 is.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:22.060]   But, and arguably, certainly, the Samsung has better hardware than anything Google's been
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:23.060]   putting on.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:28.820]   The new phones are apparently being designed by HTC to Google's specifications.
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:34.540]   I really hope Google offers this as a flagship phone, even if it's a flagship price.
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:37.980]   I hope they don't try to hit do a $350 or $400 price point.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:39.540]   You don't want to see two because I mean, they're six-
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:40.540]   Or two-two, two-two.
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:41.540]   I think that's kind of cool.
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:42.540]   But two-two.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:45.820]   One needs to have the best, as good a camera as everybody else.
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:48.900]   You know, fast storage is everyone else.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:53.420]   Google, unfortunately, is kind of committed in not doing microSD cards.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.260]   I think that's a mistake.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:59.460]   Apple doesn't do it either, but Samsung and everybody else offers SD cards.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:04.020]   So I would love to see Google say, "Alright, we're going to make a $700 phone that is top
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:05.220]   of the line.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.100]   That's the pure Android phone, and that's the one we hope people would buy."
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:10.420]   If they did that, I would be very happy, but unfortunately-
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:12.780]   Going to war with your OEMs is always incredibly risky.
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:13.780]   Right.
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:17.220]   Microsoft learned this post, Nokia.
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:18.220]   And how long did that work out?
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:19.220]   We made the joke earlier.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:23.900]   I mean, I think to do that would require being able to say, "We are willing to lose OEM
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:25.660]   partners to do this for ourselves."
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.540]   But where do OEMs go?
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:29.460]   There is no other phone operating system.
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:30.540]   And I don't know how-
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:31.540]   I'm kidding.
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:32.540]   I'm kidding.
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:33.540]   I'm kidding.
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:34.540]   Everyone, welcome up.
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:38.540]   Well, I think there's no accident that Samsung is developing its own operating system.
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.100]   It is a plan C, in my pocket.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:42.100]   It's been a plan C for a few years.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.100]   It'll stay that way.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:46.420]   Their software skills are so far behind that.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:48.420]   You can just say it's junk if you want.
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:49.420]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:50.420]   I don't say it's junk.
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.420]   I think it's watch.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:52.420]   I think it's okay.
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:53.420]   I think it's all right.
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:54.420]   I don't watch.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:55.420]   It's kind of junky.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:56.420]   I mean, but there's also the concern.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.260]   I mean, if you're a user and you buy a Nexus phone or you buy any Android phone, you go
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.380]   to the Google Play Store, you're like, "Well, these are all going to be safe because I hear
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:05.540]   about people in China who are using third party stores and are getting malware installed."
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.660]   Google really needs to step up its policing of the Google Play Store.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:08.660]   Maybe that's true.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:09.660]   That's the other side.
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:14.540]   I mean, it got downloaded 2.5 million times.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:15.540]   That's amazing.
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:20.580]   That's, I mean, 2.5 million times people got this before Google was like, "Oh, damn."
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:21.580]   Well, they have a different...
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:25.780]   Google has a different process than Apple does in terms of getting apps into their app
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.900]   store and they're a little less stringent.
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.340]   Basically, you can submit an app.
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:36.740]   There are some computer-generated scans that are done, but in most cases, people aren't
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:39.500]   actually looking at the apps themselves.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.500]   There's a lot of stuff that software can do to check an app to see whether it's safe
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:44.500]   or not.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:49.380]   But of course, when these sorts of exploits exist and they're not known, that's when
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.460]   that problem happens.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:53.780]   I've actually done some reporting on this in the past and Google says they're trying
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:39:00.380]   to step these sorts of things up, but they simply just let in a lot more apps than Apple
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:07.020]   does and they do so without less human... with fewer people looking at it.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:10.020]   It's a tough time to stem, though.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.780]   I mean, even Apple can't do it perfectly.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:12.780]   Even Apple can't do it perfectly.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:16.500]   And in some ways, maybe the problem with Apple's method is it gives you a false sense
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:17.500]   of security.
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:20.660]   At least with the Google Store, you know you're screwed.
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:21.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:22.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:23.660]   Well, you should always be careful.
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.420]   Okay, first of all, don't download the Clash of Clans box of gems.
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:32.740]   Don't download third-party apps for Instagram or Snapchat or Game or...
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:36.180]   Don't win those vids until the end of the last time.
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:37.180]   Just get the...
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.340]   I like Snapchat.
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:39.340]   Don't get Snapchat Junior.
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.340]   Yeah, and that's the best advice.
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.340]   That'll help you do so.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:46.340]   No, just don't get any of these weird third-party apps from companies you never heard of because
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:49.100]   most of the time they're just sort of... they're fishing for janky, they're bad.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.180]   A lot of them are just ad generators for...
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:52.180]   Yes.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:53.180]   They're ad-clicking.
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.780]   And a lot of those apps don't make it into Apple's App Store.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:56.780]   A lot of those...
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.060]   Oh, Apple has a share of crap apps.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.060]   They do.
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.060]   They do.
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:02.540]   But far fewer than they will play dust.
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:04.940]   The worst, of course, is the Windows phone store.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:05.940]   It's just...
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:06.940]   It's so horrible.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:07.940]   It's just...
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.940]   Yeah, but they don't have a choice.
[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:10.940]   Right.
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:11.940]   They don't have the...
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.740]   Yeah, they don't marry in the first place.
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:14.740]   They're hoping somebody will be...
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:15.740]   Instagram was...
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.740]   It probably still says Instagram beta.
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:18.740]   The Instagram app on Windows Phone.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:19.740]   Oh, sure it does.
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:20.740]   It's a sad story.
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:21.740]   It's a sad story.
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:23.740]   We've gone from options to...
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:27.140]   I want to go back to college kids because, guess what?
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:28.540]   The
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:32.540]   Music Tech is going to be getting a drone delivery of burritos from Chipotle.
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:33.540]   Okay.
[01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:34.540]   A drone.
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:35.540]   Let me say that again.
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:37.940]   In case you know that sounded too far-fetched.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:42.980]   Drone deliveries of Chipotle burritos to students in Virginia Tech.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:43.980]   Thanks to Google.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.980]   Is it a form of punishment?
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:45.980]   You had us until Chipotle.
[01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:46.980]   I was going to say that.
[01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:47.980]   But it sounds super cool.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:48.980]   Why is Chipotle?
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:49.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:53.220]   It's like if there was like beer deliveries via drone, I'm totally doubt.
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:54.220]   Chipotle is just not...
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.220]   No, let's stop for a second.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:41:00.660]   If I lived in Virginia, that might be the best burrito I'm going to get.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:01.660]   That's not so Virginia.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:02.660]   That's heartbreaking.
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:06.420]   So, when I lived in Kansas City, the best burrito I got was at Taco Bell.
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:08.140]   This is why I don't live in Virginia.
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:09.140]   Exactly.
[01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:10.140]   Okay, get ready.
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:11.140]   This is how this works.
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:12.140]   Project Wing.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.140]   We'll use...
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.820]   You could have had a much cooler name than Project Wing.
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:16.820]   Come on.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:17.820]   We'll use...
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:18.820]   Could have been Dark Wings.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:19.980]   Actually, if you're going to do Project Wing, you should deliver Chinese food.
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:20.980]   But that's another thing in terms.
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:21.980]   Or Hot Wings.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:22.980]   Or Hot Wings.
[01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:23.980]   Or Hot Wings.
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:29.860]   So, deliver will use self-guided hybrids that can fly like a plane or hover like a helicopter.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:37.380]   They will go from the Chipotle food truck to hover over the student and lower the Chipotle
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.220]   burrito with a winch.
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:40.220]   So...
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:42.220]   This is so ridiculous.
[01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:45.820]   Like college kids need to make some money.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:49.260]   Let those kids deliver burritos to each other on bikes and get a tip.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.260]   I don't know.
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:51.260]   Stay right there.
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:52.260]   Okay.
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:53.260]   So...
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:54.780]   My burrito winch is coming.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.780]   Hold on.
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:57.460]   I know this is a family friendly show.
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:59.060]   So I'm going to phrase it delicately.
[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:01.860]   But how high would you have to be to have that sound good I did?
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:04.820]   I would have to be levitating in my own shoes.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:05.820]   Oh my gosh.
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:06.820]   The burritos.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:07.820]   Come to chill out, baby.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:08.820]   Drowned.
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:09.820]   Also...
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:10.820]   I went to art school twice.
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:13.340]   So, literally everyone's high all the time.
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:17.140]   It's just me and like a couple thousand hype students.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.660]   Well, they can deliver us to your window.
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:20.820]   Like, can you like, sled open your window and like go home with the burritos?
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:21.820]   Sure.
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:22.820]   And where you can stand.
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:24.820]   And then I can just go to the hallway and I can knock it off the couch at all.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:25.820]   And it was brought into my hands.
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:27.300]   The burrito bearing...
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.300]   This story, by the way, is from Bloomberg.
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:30.300]   It's really true.
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:33.220]   The burrito bearing aircraft will be flown by automation.
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:37.220]   But human pilots will be standing by to take control if necessary.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:42.220]   I can't wait for the crazy problems that come with this place.
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.220]   The fast food drill is a gentlemen.
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:45.220]   That's all we're going to be slamming into a wall.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.620]   Like, hitting a kid.
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:48.620]   Here's one.
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:51.740]   FAA rules prohibit drones flying over people.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.860]   So please parse this sentence.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:56.380]   Participants will be shielded.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:57.380]   What?
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:58.380]   What?
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:59.380]   Oh, a burrito shield.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:00.380]   A burrito shield.
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:01.380]   What?
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:02.380]   You're going to have...
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:03.380]   Well, okay, so sign up.
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.380]   Here's what's happened.
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:05.380]   It's probably going to happen.
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:08.220]   You're going to sign up to be the person who gets a burrito delivered to you.
[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:10.060]   Then you'll get a little package.
[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.060]   And then that package will be a burrito shield.
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:13.060]   It's your burrito shield.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:14.060]   So does your burrito envelope?
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:15.060]   I want your burrito to be...
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:16.060]   I want your burrito to be...
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:17.060]   To be tin foil.
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.060]   In case of catastrophic burrito laws.
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:22.060]   And it wraps it up.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.060]   Also for the conspiracy theorists.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:27.060]   But honestly, given how much I don't like to pull a burrito, it's not a good idea.
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:31.260]   So they're starting with Chipotle to like, suss this out because there's going to be lots
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:33.740]   of like every way such a bullet burrito drops.
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:36.220]   There's going to be lots of burritos that die.
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:37.220]   And no quality ever make it there.
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.420]   And I'm going to be totally okay.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:40.420]   Those poor...
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:41.420]   All those burritos not getting eaten.
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:42.420]   That's why you have a burrito shield.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:43.420]   Those poor squirrels.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:44.420]   It's so...
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.420]   It's raining burritos, dude.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:49.420]   I'm going to be burning man.
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:50.420]   The burrito drops are the burritos.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:51.420]   Alright, alright.
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:52.420]   I'm talking to you.
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:53.420]   Oh man.
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:56.060]   It might have been a nice thing to have.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.660]   But still Chipotle.
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.660]   But maybe.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.660]   Maybe.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:00.660]   Maybe down the road.
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:01.660]   This will work for a chipotle.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:06.420]   I mean I know the E. coli thing took some of the bloom off the rose.
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:07.420]   But yeah.
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:08.420]   So to speak.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:09.420]   But it's...
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:10.420]   That was good food, isn't it?
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.420]   Is it?
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:12.420]   I'm the wrong person to ask.
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:14.420]   Because I'm Mexican American and I grew up eating Mexican food.
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:15.420]   Oh.
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:16.420]   My family.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:19.100]   You've got to go to Elroy's taco truck over here.
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:20.100]   This is where it's at?
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:21.100]   Elroy's.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:22.580]   As in The King.
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:23.580]   It's awesome.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:29.180]   It's voted widely agreed to be the best burrito in North Central Petaloma.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:33.540]   We're doing that.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:34.540]   We are doing that.
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:35.540]   I mean you're just like cheeseburgers.
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:37.540]   I can't even afford a hoo.
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:41.060]   We all three of us drove here together so we can definitely make that happen.
[01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:42.540]   You already hit the in and out.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:43.540]   Three nerds, one Jeep.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:46.540]   I love burritos.
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:50.020]   But no, I mean Chipotle is great for a lot of people love Chipotle.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.260]   Again, I just don't.
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:52.260]   We live in San Francisco.
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:53.260]   Apologize to all those who do.
[01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:54.260]   Do we care?
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:55.260]   We grew up in the Southwest.
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:56.260]   You know what's left here.
[01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:57.260]   Our parents are Mexican.
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:58.260]   You know what's up.
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:44:59.260]   Robbie knows what's up.
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:00.260]   I used to live in Mexico.
[01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.740]   He used to live in Mexico so we have a very like our burrito.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:06.740]   And if you live in San Francisco you have very strong opinions about burritos.
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:09.860]   Like more so than like I think anywhere else in the world.
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:10.860]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:11.860]   I'm sorry to be a burrito snob.
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:12.860]   Yeah, we're burritos snobs.
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:13.860]   I'm not.
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:14.860]   So everyone else in the rest of the country.
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:16.780]   Please enjoy your Chipotle debris.
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:18.980]   The Elroy Taco truck is so authentic.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:20.260]   It's not open on Sundays.
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:21.260]   Oh, damn.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:22.260]   So sorry.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:23.260]   All right.
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:31.220]   Do we care about Facebook and the human editors and then the fake news and the trending topics?
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:32.220]   Yes.
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:38.380]   A little bit because either A, get rid of trending topics because it's just not it's
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:43.060]   an embarrassment for the company or B, help to make it there for somebody.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:47.940]   Well, no, they did and then they had to fire them because they're like, oh, we don't because
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:49.660]   there was like really no oversight.
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:53.460]   There's like, oh, here, just throw some people into it and just see what happens.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:54.460]   Someone must be looking at it.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.860]   Someone's clicking on it.
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:59.180]   So trending right now on my Facebook CM Punk.
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.780]   I don't even know what that is.
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:03.940]   Oh, it's a it's a UFC thing.
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.020]   Mine's Raspberry Pi.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:10.220]   Galaxy Note 7 Canadian airline passengers were not to use a note seven and Steve Harvey
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.820]   meets his look alike on family feud.
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:15.420]   Oh, man.
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:17.260]   I take back everything I said about that.
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:18.260]   That is awesome.
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:19.340]   They're my trending box.
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:20.740]   You win.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:24.700]   Does anybody I mean, I think that whole right hand gutter on Twitter is I mean on Facebook
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.100]   is really kind of not kind of garbage used.
