[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.120]   My old friend, Mr. Patrick Norton, from Tekzilla.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.080]   He's on from his, it looks like it's one of those big snap-on toolboxes behind you.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.640]   Is this your garage?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.080]   No, it's actually an Ikea cabinet, a corner of dining room.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.240]   But nice red metal enamel steel.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.240]   It looks smart.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's very attractive.

[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.880]   I just want to say big congrats to Brett Farb for his win today.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.120]   Who do you play for?
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   Minnesota.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.600]   Remember, they picked him up.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   They beat the 49ers.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   They beat the Niners.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   The undefeated 49ers.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   Right.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.960]   At the last second touchdown.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.560]   So why would you congratulate the miserable team?
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.760]   And that guy, by the way, Farb will be probably not even playing by the end of the season.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.440]   Oh, because he's a game against the past.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.960]   Because he's a game from the past.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.400]   So I can see why you'd say that.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.360]   That third voice, the disembodied voice of John C. Devorek.

[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   Did I say that?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   Channeldevorek.com.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   Yes, I missed out camera.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   I screwed up and I forgot my camera.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   I don't care.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   That's right.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   So can nobody cares.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   We don't come be cares.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.000]   You know, if I were like a real television station, I put a big ugly picture of you up
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   on this.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.440]   So that would just be my picture.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.720]   The best thing would be if I could get a picture of you, yeah, the still store.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.920]   If I get a picture of you, John, holding a phone and I could say, you know, on location
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   in Caracas.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   Exactly.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.640]   With a map superimposed behind me.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.520]   Yeah, a little dot, a little pin in the map.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.640]   I think it would be kind of fun to do this stuff.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.440]   Very retro, like just old school TV.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.920]   Just kind of fun.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.680]   I can't make it black and white.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.320]   I don't know if that's good or not, but I could do that much.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.120]   Certainly retro.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.040]   I just feel like Edward R. Murrow.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   Good night and good luck.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.280]   Did you see Google misspelled its name on the website today?
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   Really?
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   Two L's.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   Google.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.920]   But there's a reason.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.160]   That's really, it was really funny when it first happened to see all the people on Facebook
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.360]   and Twitter going, Google, what's going on?
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.800]   What is happening?
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.280]   And then everybody goes, Oh, it's Google's 11th birthday.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.560]   Oh, see, L L is like 11.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   Get it?
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   Wow.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.720]   Now, I wonder, and I should try this.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.520]   If you went to G O G L L E, would you?
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   Would they smart enough to reserve?
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.240]   No, they didn't reserve that.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   That would have been cool.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   But they didn't do that.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   So happy 11th birthday.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   They have the extra.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   Oh, I think.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.240]   Yeah, they have the extra.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.880]   Like a three O Google, they own that.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.280]   It's president do 010111.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.120]   That would have been cool too.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.400]   They could have turned it into, yeah, Google is 11, although nobody agrees on exactly when
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.960]   Google was started.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.000]   Google's decided to make the 27th.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.760]   It's official birthday.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.520]   I guess that's when they, I don't know if that's when they went live or filed for the name,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.440]   or I can't remember why it's why it's their 11th birthday.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.760]   And if you, by the way, if you Google, you know, you click the thing, you can't, that
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.760]   doesn't have any information on it.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.640]   But happy birthday anyway.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.320]   Do you remember?
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   You were at tech TV, I think.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.120]   All these guys when Google started, you remember our early coverage of Google at all?
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.320]   I don't remember it.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.320]   Sort of snuck up on everybody.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.040]   I kind of remember first using it.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.640]   And John, I remember you would ask people what, when Google was, you know, became big
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.480]   among the geeks, you'd ask them what search engine they used.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.360]   And if they said Yahoo, you would come.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.960]   I think less of them.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   Yeah, actually.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   It's a good test.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.720]   When I was doing big thinkers, which was, could have been named big stinkers, I would,
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.120]   oh, dude, how many different people come on and ask every one of them what they'd use.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.360]   You kind of the last question of the, of the interview and they'd all said Yahoo without
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.360]   exception.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.760]   Very innocently you would ask that.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.880]   Waiting for one of them finally to say, Altavista, the true search engine of choice.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.040]   Stumble, stumble and say Altavista.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.520]   Anyway, happy birthday, Google.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.760]   And now 11 years old.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.200]   And that just means we're getting older.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   That's all that means.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.000]   Google introduced, and I'd love to know what you guys think of this, the side wiki thing
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.240]   and got a lot of howls from the internet.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.320]   The idea is you go to a web page and if you have the side wiki, actually if you have the
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.440]   either, if you have the Google toolbar installed or down the road, Chrome is going to support
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.440]   this.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.440]   That's what's really scary.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   So if you're using Chrome and you go to a website, you'll see a little button on the left
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.200]   and you can open that sidebar and it'll have comments from people that are not hosted
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.240]   by the website, but hosted by Google and that the owner of the website has no control over.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.200]   It's not a wiki, but it's a, basically it's a, it's a third party.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.080]   What do you comment system on websites?
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.280]   It's a convection system.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.640]   Yeah, Seth Godin about that because these things are always tricky.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.360]   Take it from the big bar, which also had comments that you can fold down on top of other people's
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.360]   sites.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   Right.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.920]   You got a lot of heat for that and the framing.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.520]   Yeah, there's good and bad.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.840]   I first saw one of these things back in the late 90s and then Microsoft was going to do
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.600]   something similar and these things get rejected by the public.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   They're annoying.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.560]   The thing that will make it a little more concerning is if they build it into Chrome and you're
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.400]   using Chrome, you just get it kind of automatic.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.600]   I mean, I'm not going to stalk Google toolbar.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.240]   Who wants to stalk Google toolbar?
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.640]   Have you guys heard much about the Facebook browser and when that's coming out?
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.760]   They have a browser?
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.640]   I don't know that they have a browser.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   Yes, you do.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   Yes, you do.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   I just saw something I heard.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   I don't know.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   I heard.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   Oh, that's just my copy now.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   I heard all about that.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   I heard all about that.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.720]   You're now thinking about the dig browser.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   I heard all about that.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.120]   Get a bit of an IE, Kevin.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.120]   I do love.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   I love Facebook.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.280]   That would be my last choice.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.280]   No, I love Facebook.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   Well, Google did that.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.280]   Did you see that was the other thing?
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   Google did.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.800]   The wave team finally got tired of trying to make wave work in Chrome or Internet Explorer
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.400]   because it needs HTML5 and IE has no HTML5.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.240]   So they just made a Chrome insert for Internet Explorer.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.000]   So now when you go to a site that needs HTML5, it launches Chrome inside of your browser
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   to play HTML5.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   It says, yes.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Nice hack.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.920]   The site can say, you know, you need a lad on and it puts a Chrome frame inside of IE.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.360]   What it should also say is on the crop to that is your browser sucks.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.600]   Try something else.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   That's basically it.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:33.160]   Hey, I got to say Internet Explorer has been lower in resource usage than IE8, Firefox,
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.720]   and yeah, then Firefox into a lesser degree Chrome.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.560]   And the whole multiprocess thing in Chrome started driving me insane.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.600]   Really, you know, I like the speed of Chrome.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.240]   I miss the Firefox extensions, but Firefox seems to be turning into a pig.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.440]   Now Firefox is definitely on WebKit, right?
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.440]   Sing in?
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.920]   Chrome is built on WebKit.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   Yes.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   That's right.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.520]   So Safari and Chrome now on WebKit and of course Safari on for the iPhone.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.160]   I think though that the Chrome is a fork of, I don't know if it's, I don't know this actually,
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.880]   but I would guess it's a fork of WebKit.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.320]   In other words, that it's, it's, it's separated now off of WebKit.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.000]   I don't know if they fold new WebKit stuff back into it or if any, and this is more to
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.080]   the point if any of the features of Chrome get back into Safari.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.880]   That would be the, you know, if it, if that were the case, that would be great news.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.120]   Because Safari and Chrome would kind of be on a, on a par.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.680]   Does anybody know that?
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:38.280]   I don't know if they, I don't know if they're a fork or a, a, a, a, a kind of a related to
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   the project.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   Sure.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.600]   The chat room knows.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.200]   I'm looking in the chat room.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.360]   As usual, they're busy talking about something else.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.200]   They have no idea.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.240]   Eric Schmidt says Google is back on the acquisition trail, which surprised me because I didn't
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.760]   know they were off it, but apparently they had slowed way, way down on buying stuff.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.560]   They didn't buy dig.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.000]   That might be a sore spot, Patrick.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I would raise that.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.840]   I would enjoy this coffee again, Patrick.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.840]   Thank you.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.240]   A little bit of a sore point.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.680]   I know that Mike Harrington thought that was going to happen.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.720]   You can tell us now, Kevin, was Mike right?
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   I can't.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.080]   There are documents.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.920]   I will say there are documents that prevent me from telling you this type of stuff that
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.920]   I can't say.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.920]   Mike was right.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:33.560]   I'm going to guess Google bought double click for $3.2 billion last year, YouTube for 1.65
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.560]   in 2006.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:42.040]   This is not like they haven't been buying anything, but now he says, Eric Schmidt says,
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.200]   we have $19 billion in cash.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.040]   If they were smart, they buy Twitter right now.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   You think?
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.840]   Twitter might be expensive now.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.200]   They got another $100 million round.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.760]   He says the rumors, that values them at $1 billion.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   It's $19 billion.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760]   That's true.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.280]   Money is sitting around earning what?
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.720]   2% interest is 5% of Google's cash fund.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.640]   What would you do if he...
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.600]   Let's say, okay, this is good.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.640]   Let's say you're Google, Kevin.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.320]   The first thing you say is, all right, let's spend a little bit of this money.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320]   Let's buy Twitter.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.440]   Do you do anything different with Twitter?
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   What do you do with Twitter now if you're Google and you have it?
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.640]   You use the data, obviously, because if you think about the way that PageRank works,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.320]   it's based on humans going and creating links on web pages and then publishing those pages
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   to the web.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   They crawl it and they can determine rank and relevance based on that.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   Twitter is essentially the same thing, but more real time, right?
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.840]   Because you have people sending out links.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.960]   Those humans could then have a people rank applied to them.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.720]   They'd have a more real time search.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.600]   I think that's where Twitter is going.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.360]   They've hinted in that direction for a long time now.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.480]   You can see how quick they're able to break things with their trends and other things
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   they have going on.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.520]   If they folded this into search, it would be a huge win for them.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.400]   You said an interesting thing, though, because right now with Twitter, this is the problem.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.320]   You get these trending stories, but there's no karma.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   There's no ranking of the people, so you get stupid trending stories.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.000]   You get good night around...
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   In the evening.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.800]   11 o'clock, Eastern time, all of a sudden that becomes trending because everyone's saying
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.760]   good night to everyone else.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.320]   There's a lot of other stuff going on behind the scenes with this data.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.440]   People are starting to look at who these individuals are, how precious they are, how good they
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.080]   are at finding links that eventually become very popular.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.600]   We might be playing around with that kind of data.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.760]   It's like there's a lot of people that are going to leverage this stuff for a more real
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.680]   time web here very shortly.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:48.000]   One of the things that people often talk about, do you think this is valuable, is mapping...
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.240]   I hate using these terms because it's very jargony, but mapping your social graph to
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.600]   this search, which means, in a sense, these are the people I care about.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.920]   Twitter does this very well because those are the people I follow.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.840]   What do they say about a topic?
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.840]   Right.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   As opposed to just...
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.840]   Both are valuable.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   I'd like to know what the community at large is saying about Iran, the elections in Iran,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.400]   but I'd also like to know what those hand-picked 300 people that I follow say about Iran.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   Right.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   Absolutely.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.680]   I think that this is baby steps in eventually being able to ask questions of the social
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680]   graph.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.120]   Being able to say, "Okay, I'm looking for a dentist in San Francisco.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:31.840]   It's not who is the most followed dentist, but based on people I trust and I put weight
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.200]   into their opinion, who are they following and who do they think is relevant for me?
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.440]   Can the graph provide me that answer back?"
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.120]   It's early days, but it's all stuff that people are trying to make sense of right now.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.880]   I keep hearing people talk about this and I just wonder what the world's going to look
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.880]   like.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.080]   Does Google feel like if they don't do this, if they just stay a stale old index, the web
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.400]   search engine that they're going to miss out, you think?
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:03.000]   Is this real-time search going to be more important in the long run?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.520]   Or is it just another form of search?
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.760]   In my mind, it's just an evolution of the way things are going.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.120]   Like I said, originally when you were creating web pages and that's where you were placing
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.680]   your weight in actually linking something up, it's the same thing as happening all the
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.680]   time.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.480]   Millions of links per day are being sent out and linked up on Twitter.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.960]   It's a more real-time feed than actually waiting for someone to go and blog about something
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.800]   or someone to go and publish a webpage about something.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.000]   The whole idea is that if you survey a group, the group's choices tend to reflect around
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   what becomes an accurate answer.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I'm trying to figure out the crowd.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.320]   There's a phrase for that when you're doing futuristics and political science and stuff.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.120]   Pick up the book, The Wisdom and the Crowds.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.120]   It's all about that.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.120]   It's amazing.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.120]   That's the one.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.120]   James Surawicki.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.720]   Do you hadn't read that when you started Dig?
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.960]   Actually, I don't think it was out when you started Digi.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960]   Maybe.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.760]   I know it was out within the first six months of the year because all of a sudden reporters
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.080]   kept asking me, "Have you read the book?
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   Have you read the book?"
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.080]   And I'm like, "No, I'm kind of scared now to read this.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.600]   My change or shape, my feelings on the topic."
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.440]   But I read it and then I was just like, "Wow, this all kind of makes sense now."
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.440]   It's a great read.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.800]   However, in hindsight now, you've been working with The Wisdom of Crowds for seven years.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:22.080]   In hindsight, are there some pitfalls, some things that maybe have you learned?
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.080]   Yeah, I don't think-
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.960]   We're talking a lot of pictures of Anna Cornicova or Tritu.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.760]   I have dug a few of those myself there.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.840]   Seriously, I don't think that Digi is a true wisdom of the crowds.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.360]   When you sort our upcoming section or stories that are about to be on the homepage, you
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.280]   kind of see which way the crowd is leaning.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   You see the number of Digs.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.280]   You see what people are commenting on.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.880]   You see who the submitter is.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.280]   True wisdom of the crowds is done on an individual basis where they have no information about
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.040]   how the rest of the crowd is winning in on that particular topic.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.280]   We have a little product coming out in a few weeks that is going to get away.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.480]   Get us a little bit closer to that goal of having it be an individual going out, checking
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.440]   something out and saying, "Okay, does this really matter to me?
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.600]   Is it something I want to vote on?"
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.720]   You do this to me every frickin' time you're on the show.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.200]   Kevin always has.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.000]   Well, maybe it's just a measure of how many new products you have coming out, but you're
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.200]   always saying, "In two weeks, we've got something really exciting.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:26.720]   I got the sense from your interview at TechCrunch 50 with TechCrunch that this is a big announcement
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.720]   coming.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.880]   Yeah, this one is going to be a smaller feature that will be rolled into a much bigger redesign
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   that's coming a little bit later.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.560]   So you do have a big redesign on the way?
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.800]   Yeah, the problem, honestly, is that MySQL can only go so far.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.280]   We've hit those limits now.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.520]   We're doing right around 40 million uniques a month.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.120]   We've had to completely refactor the back end.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.280]   A lot of that work is almost done, and then we can apply a new redesign and a bunch of
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.160]   other new stuff onto the site.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.200]   We're using some of the infrastructure stuff that Facebook is using called Cassandra and
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.760]   a few other projects out there for storing data that's different than our MySQL back
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.760]   end.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.320]   Do you guys work pretty closely with Facebook?
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:18.600]   We now write code back and contribute source code back to Cassandra, and we've helped them
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   out.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   They help us out.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   We do.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.440]   We were over at Twitter a few weeks ago doing a little project together where we all write
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.520]   code and share it back.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.720]   So, I think that these engineers, we're all buddies with each other.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.400]   So it's very common for big tech companies to get together and say, "Hey, we're all
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.920]   working on the same problems.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.120]   We're all having the same scalability issues.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.680]   Let's all get our heads in the same room and try and figure them out together."
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680]   I think that's great.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.360]   It's the way to do things.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.640]   It is the way to do things, and it's a very new way to do things.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:53.400]   I can't imagine Ford going over saying hi to GM saying, "What do you think about these
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   engine mounts?"
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.080]   I mean, maybe they did.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   I don't know.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.440]   It just doesn't seem like the way business was done 50 years ago.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.720]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.760]   It's really cool that everything's going the open source route and that these guys will
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.280]   get together.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   We don't share product visions like six months what we're planning on doing.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   No, of course not.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.840]   But if there's certain things that can be done that just benefit everyone, you work together.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.920]   And Cassandra's an open source project, right?
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.920]   Right.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.840]   And from the Friend Feed chat room is telling me that WebKit is the same WebKit for Safari
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.560]   and Chrome, and they're both part of that development.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.040]   So, things flow back and forth much the same way that you were just talking about back
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   and forth.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's interesting because you and at Dig and Facebook and Twitter are both kind of pushing
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.520]   the upper limits of bears telling our system and upper limits of what these servers can
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.520]   do.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.800]   So really what you're finding out is what happens when you get 22 million visitors.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.280]   What happens when you get 200 million visitors?
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.560]   What happens next?
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.120]   Nobody's scaled like this before.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.760]   Yeah, it takes a different type of engineer to work on it.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.760]   No kidding.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.960]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   Let's see.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.120]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.960]   We got a number of spots.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.680]   I want to just get a couple in or get one in anyway before we get to.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.160]   I want to ask you about the Fitbit Kevin and also about TechCrunch 50.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.160]   I know you were a judge there and you saw anything really cool.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.480]   Some people were really happy to have you in there.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.920]   But first let's talk about backup with Carbonite.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.880]   You've heard me talk about this.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.560]   In fact, one of our hosts just got a Macintosh.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.120]   She's brand new.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.080]   Switched to the Mac from Windows and she said, "All right.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.080]   It's a laptop.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.240]   I know I got to back it up.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.240]   What do you recommend?"
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.160]   I said, "Well, it's kind of a no-brainer.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.240]   You got to get Carbonite for a laptop because Carbonite backs up over the Internet and there's
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   a beauty of it."
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:55.120]   With Carbonite, if I can go there right now, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com, if you use the coupon
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.000]   code TWIT, you try it free even without a credit card.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.400]   You don't need a credit card to sign up so you can just install it.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.600]   You'll see what it starts doing immediately is backing up to the Internet, all your financial
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.440]   records, your photos, your email, all the stuff that you can't afford to lose.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   Don't worry about security.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.320]   It's using AES-256-bit encryption, really, really strong encryption on the drive before
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.440]   it sends it and then SSL on the way so it's double encrypted so your privacy is absolutely
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   protected.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.880]   But then it's safe in the cloud.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.520]   Even if the worst happens, fire, flood, a hurricane, tornado, and everything's gone and
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.800]   flattened, Carbonite's got it backed up and you can get it back.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.960]   You can even go to your Carbonite account from any computer and get those files so you never
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.720]   lose data again.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.040]   This is how I got to know Carbonite.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.480]   I had lost a couple of podcasts about three or four years ago, 10 gizwizs.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.120]   I had a call that can say.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.160]   Would you mind recording those again?
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.520]   And then we had interviewed, I think it was Brian Acre.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   I can't remember.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.560]   Somebody from the, maybe it's from my SQL and I interviewed him once with Chris Dibona
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.440]   for Floss and lost it.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   Interviewed him again, lost it.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.560]   I had to send a basket, a gift basket before we got him back on.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.160]   That's when I said I need Carbonite.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.240]   Now I don't have to worry and the beauty of this is it's unlimited backup, everything
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.520]   that's on your hard drive.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.600]   So I don't have to think, oh gosh, those podcasts, that's gigabytes, it just does it.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   It's up in the background, always up to date and unlimited backup for less than five bucks
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.600]   a month.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.400]   That's the beauty of this Mac or PC, 54.95 a year, I think.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   But try it free.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.800]   Go to carbonite.com, use the coupon code TWIT.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.840]   And if you do that, by the way, and then decide to buy, you get two free months.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.400]   You have to use a free trial first.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   It's a little confusing.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.520]   Can't just buy it, use the coupon code and get two free months.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.680]   You have to use the trial first.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.560]   Tomorrow, if you want to buy it, you'll get the two free months.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   And I got it done right.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   I heard somebody leave.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.520]   John, did you go somewhere?
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520]   No, no.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   Okay.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.400]   I didn't know where someone else.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   Okay.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   You've been quiet.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.800]   Or it could be my daughter scampering in and out for a USB drive.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.920]   Have you guys been watching the USB 3?
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.240]   Did you cover this on Taxilla yet, Patrick?
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.600]   We've been poking around on it waiting for something really solid to come up to talk
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   about.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:15.640]   Because remember when USB came out, about two, four years later, it was on every PC bay,
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.560]   then about six years after that, what was the original gum drop?
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   Was it an iMac?
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.560]   It's been so long, like 98.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   Yeah, the iMac.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.160]   And then, suddenly a year after that, there were actually USB peripherals and volume.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.600]   So I'm not...
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.400]   I think it'll go faster this time.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.600]   I think it will go faster this time, but I'm not expecting a real rush at this point.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.040]   But it doesn't go fast.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.560]   The USB 3, it's four gigabits.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.560]   It's stuck in the middle of nowhere.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.160]   What?
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   You don't think?
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.600]   No, I think it's going to go fast and date.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.280]   Finally, I mean, it didn't...
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.280]   Somebody's stalling on it.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.280]   The thing is not...
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.680]   Well, now they're saying the first hardware is going to come out this year, computer,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.080]   whether they're going to start coming out and they'll like, Patrick, you...
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.120]   No, it's not like John, you're very skeptical, aren't you?
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.600]   Well, partially it's because like, did you know that 802.11n, the spec was finally
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   officialized?
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.600]   Finally.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.600]   Finally.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:15.720]   So they released the potential spec for USB 3.0 back in November of 2008.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.680]   I have nothing against a faster, better USB.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.480]   I'm just kind of curious to see how they're going to implement it.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.640]   And more importantly, what's actually going to come close to using that unless they expect
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   people to do a lot of like, outboard, flash-based hard drives, which within 18 months could
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.640]   be a reality.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.560]   Sort of an outboard, flash-based rate could be really...
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.560]   Right.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   Right.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.600]   Well, get ready because the next thing is light peak.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   Have you...
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   Did you...
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:50.160]   Intel at the IDF this week, the Intel developers forum showed this new 10 gigabit connection.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.760]   It's basically fiber optic.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.560]   It's a little thin thing.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:24:00.880]   So small that you can build a surface mount connector on the motherboard for it.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.320]   They showed it first at IDF.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.440]   It turns out now I'm looking at a number of new stories that say, "Just as...
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:12.240]   Apple shepherded firewire out and SCSI too, really."
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.120]   Apple's also behind this light peak thing with Intel.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.440]   So if you thought 4 gigabits wasn't fast enough with USB 3, well, don't worry because
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.000]   we're going to have 10 gigabits.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   I don't...
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.400]   And it's actually engineered to go to 100 rather easily.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.400]   So what is...
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.560]   What do you use this stuff with?
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   I mean, I think...
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.400]   This is bogus flash-based memory.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.040]   I mean, John's half-right.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   It's half bogus.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   It's also half future-proofing because it looks like flash-based hard drives are going
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.040]   to go mainstream probably inside a two to three years and are going to be pretty affordable
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.720]   options by the end of next year.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.680]   By the end of 2010, I think flash-based hard drives and notebooks are going to be relatively
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   common.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.600]   I put one in my MacBook and I'll never go back.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.240]   It's amazing.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   Which ones you get?
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.080]   I think it was an OCZ.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.520]   You don't need to get the X-25, the hot Intel.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   It's nice.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.080]   It's very pricey.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.720]   You get a lot of the benefit from OCZ.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.760]   I mean, my boot time is almost instantaneous once it goes through the memory and the post
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.920]   stuff when it actually starts hitting the hard drive.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.120]   From the time it starts hitting the hard drive to the time it's ready to use is literally
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.920]   three or four seconds on the Mac.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.840]   And that's not normally that fast.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.200]   It's like an order of magnitude fast on a per-law machine.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.040]   We actually had a NAN from anandtech.com.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.560]   We're talking about some of the stuff at IDF.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.280]   And for a separate thing, interviewed him.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.440]   He was the guy who kind of uncovered a lot of the flaws in the early SSD drives.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.880]   He's a huge, huge fan of going to solid state.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.680]   And it was kind of funny to hear him like, you know what I mean?
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:51.320]   He's obviously not as grouchy as John C. Devore-Acker as sort of pessimistic as I am.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   But it was fun to watch him.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   He's just like, "SSD's are amazing.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.240]   Everybody's going to want them."
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:01.200]   It's not because they're not exactly cheap yet, but it's astonishing the kind of performance
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.960]   that's best you get out of them.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.000]   It was Alan Mavantana, who's my hard drive SSD consultant.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.600]   He does testing for PC perspective.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.760]   This guy is like, he's the guy who found the fragmentation issue with the Intel drives
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   and Intel denied it first.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   And then they said, "Oh, no, you're right."
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.920]   And they upgraded it.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.040]   But he recommended the Corsair S120, S120.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.760]   That's what I bought as a 128 gig Corsair.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.680]   400 bucks, I think, something like that.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.560]   A lot of my league at this point, but a nice hard drive.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.560]   More and more rockable.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.480]   But then I only have 128 gigs.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.800]   So I'm an idiot.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.080]   I took out my super drive and I bought this thing that mounts another.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.880]   So I have two hard drives in my MacBook.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.880]   So I have--
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   Why?
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.560]   Because then I can put more stuff on it.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.000]   Because he's adding another 92 gigabytes in podcast every week, John.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.400]   So no, I filled it up.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:53.040]   So John, so the boot drive, which is this SSD, is really fast boots.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.600]   And then all the data is on the second 320.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.440]   I think it was a 320 gig drive, it was the original Apple drive that I took out to put
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.040]   the SSD in.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.360]   And no, with pictures, with music.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.520]   But then I also got an external drive, a terra by 750 gig external.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   So--
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   Wait a second, Lil.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   You're saying all this is on your MacBook?
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.520]   On your Mac?
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.520]   Wow.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.520]   It's kind of stupid.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   It's my main computer.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.520]   Yeah, it's nuts.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   No, but it's my main computer.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   I don't use a desktop.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.920]   It's your main computer for your sitting.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   For one thing, you're in this office.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.120]   Well, I'm surrounded by 14 computers, but I can't take these home.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.280]   John, you've been slagging flash drives in your column.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   Why have you ever actually--
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.640]   I love flash drives.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.000]   Really, John doesn't like them?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.520]   John, John wrote a big column for PCMag.com about how flash drives for the beginning of
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.880]   the end of all humanity and that they're going to kill us all.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.360]   I mean, have you ever actually used one in a computer yet, John?
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   I have.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.800]   A machine right here that has a flat-- that one of the Intel drives, as a matter of fact.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   And you don't like it.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.920]   Don't say a performance improvement.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.360]   You don't enjoy it at all.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   It doesn't increase productivity or--
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   It's because it's Windows.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.560]   I don't think Windows gets as much benefit.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   I'm actually running Linux on it.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   Oh.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.560]   Well, and you don't see a speed improvement?
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.760]   Well, yeah, because it's a small machine.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.800]   It's actually a machine that's kind of weirdly architected.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.040]   It's running an atom.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.040]   Oh, no, no.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   Then you won't get it.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.040]   I put no.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   It's fine.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.800]   It's just a little machine.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.780]   You won't get the benefit because these atom motherboards don't have the throughput
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.780]   on the motherboard.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.000]   You won't see-- you're wasted your money on an X25 in that thing.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   That's nuts.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   You should put the stupidest--
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   I wasted my money.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Well, not your money.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.200]   Whoever gave it to use money.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   It gives me an iPhone.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   Wow.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.400]   I need some clarity here.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.680]   I have a MacBook Pro.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.160]   Tell me which drive I need to buy.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.000]   So what you do, it's very easy in the Pro.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.160]   You can just take out the cover and you see the battery there.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.000]   You also see the hard drive on the new Unibodies.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   It's very easy.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.880]   It's a couple of screws to take the hard drive out.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.600]   They do screw it in.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.860]   I bought the Corsair S128.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.260]   I don't know what the price is now.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.460]   It's probably under 400 bucks.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.420]   Not even one bounce to launch an application.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.420]   It doesn't bounce at all.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.420]   Just boom.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.860]   I promise you, Kevin, you will really be glad you did this.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.260]   The less bouncing the better for me.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.260]   I'm happy about it.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.860]   Actually, Allen says the X25M is a good choice for the MacBook because that bus will take
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.860]   advantage of it.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.460]   But the atom motherboard buses won't.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.340]   So I just basically get horn swaggled.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.940]   I mean, you're not seeing the benefit of an SSD.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.440]   Well, it's performing better.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.920]   I got plenty of this drive so I can take it and put it someplace.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.080]   Yeah, that's what I would do.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:35.680]   I pop that X25 out of the netbook and put it in a real laptop and you will...
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.880]   It says, "Not a netbook."
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.080]   It's a net top.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.080]   What?
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.080]   And that...
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.680]   You know, it's not a netbook.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.480]   It's in a little bitty, small form factor desktop box.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   All right.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.480]   Okay.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.480]   Yeah, the atom motherboard...
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.200]   Because I had the same issue and I asked Allen and he said, "Well, the issue is that
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.120]   those bus speeds on those motherboards, he told me the details and I can't remember
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   the details.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   I'll have to ask him again.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   He's in the chat room.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.440]   Just don't take advantage of the speed of the SSD drive.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   But you...
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.800]   I'm good with the Unibody 2.8 gigahertz.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.440]   You're going to love it.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   All right.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.040]   It is probably the best upgrade I ever made.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.480]   I think better than putting more RAM in.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.960]   It's a great upgrade.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.960]   It doesn't...
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.960]   Malmatano says it doesn't use the full SATA 2 speed.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.880]   So what you want is a motherboard that goes full SATA 2 speed, which is what?
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   3 gigabits.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.600]   And it doesn't go to the 3 gigabits.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.680]   So you're just not seeing the benefit.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.560]   You're seeing the reduced access time.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.760]   There's two benefits to SSD.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:42.400]   Virtually zero access time because it's random access and faster reads.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.760]   But you don't see the faster read benefit.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.760]   Okay.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.040]   Well, I'm just going to be glad you're all.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:57.880]   I mean, I mean, I can mention that whatever you're selling there, Leo.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:03.520]   French Parliament, main mandate, full Photoshop disclosure.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.720]   If you use Photoshop, you will have to put it in writing on the advertisement.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.000]   I think this is actually a very...
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   I don't know.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   It's a good idea.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:21.200]   Over 50 politicians in the French Assembly say that any time a picture has been modified,
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   photoshopped in effect, in an advertisement, in a news story, in product packaging, you'll
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:33.400]   have to put the footer photograph or retouched to modify the physical appearance of a persona.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.080]   But you'd have to do it in French.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.680]   So they've all the years and years of airbrushing that went on.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.240]   And all the cutting and pasting and modification of photos that went on for years and years
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.320]   and decades and centuries for all we know, that was okay.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   But now that these Photoshop...
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   You know what's interesting?
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.680]   This is something that would come out as a American product, a French hatist.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.680]   Probably it.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.480]   Now, this sounds like something that would come out of the Berkeley City Council.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.080]   This is their rationale.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   Totally.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.680]   It says, "Photoshopped images can, quote, lead people to believe in a reality that it does
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   not actually exist.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.960]   They might as well just put a ban on unicorns on the boxes too and have a detrimental effect
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.520]   on adolescence."
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.560]   Because they're worried, you know, body image.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.400]   I don't know.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   What do you think?
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.400]   Good idea?
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.600]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.160]   Patrick Photoshop, warning on all boxes.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.600]   So everything that's like, if they've added a little flag, just like for objects and people.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.600]   Just people.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   Just people.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   Everything is okay.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600]   Everything.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   Everything.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   You go to a movie.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   You're professional.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   You're always going to Photoshop it.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   So this is going to stop Anorexia and bulimia because now...
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   You'll know the truth.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   Unmodified.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   So the...
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   No.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   People will be modified.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   They just have to tell you they're modified.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   In what?
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   4.5 at the bottom?
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   What does modified mean?
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   What about changing the complexion of somebody?
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   Exactly.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   I was going to say...
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.600]   The color is a little bit.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.160]   And the moment thing they're going to do is just mess around with the colors, right?
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.680]   And everything is going to be...
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.960]   Every picture I take goes through Lightroom.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.120]   Every one of them.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.560]   Did you see that picture of Carmen Electra without makeup on?
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   No.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.560]   Is she a dog?
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.560]   I'm going to...
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.560]   Well, that's why she did it, right?
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.840]   We know for a fact maybe it was bold.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.840]   Maybe it was BS.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.840]   Maybe it was a scam.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.840]   Well, yeah.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   But John, you surely just scratch on her face.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.880]   It was if she had makeup on.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.320]   John, have you ever walked around the street and see it as a spectacularly beautiful woman?
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   Yes.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   Never.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.320]   I have never done it.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   But I don't...
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.400]   I had makeup on because some of these women can put makeup on.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.720]   You would never know it was makeup because we're getting eyes.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.760]   What are you saying that we should have...
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.720]   People should hang a sign around their necks that said I used makeup.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.400]   I used makeup like modified by image on the street.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.400]   You know what?
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.480]   She looks like she's 18.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.200]   How old is Carmen Electra?
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.640]   She looks completely different.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.640]   I know.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.880]   It's crazy.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.400]   She's...
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   I'm skeptical.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   What do you mean?
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.280]   No, she's definitely got no makeup on.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.040]   You know, she does a hate or debate.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.360]   How can you say that from a photo?
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.280]   Oh, you mean she's got like different makeup on?
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.120]   She looks like they're done.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   You know what?
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.600]   She's definitely got mascara on those lashes.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.200]   There's no way that's natural.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   I always think when I see pictures...
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.520]   I should just buffaloed.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.640]   I always think when I see pictures like this, that's what she would...
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.760]   That's what it would look like if you woke up next to her.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.360]   That's what she would look like.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.360]   You hope.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.360]   You guys are a girl.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.360]   I know how many years I can be.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   I can...
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.440]   Hey, they should put my woke up next to Carmen Electra.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.760]   There'd be a pilot to keel bottles and probably a warrant for my arrest.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   So...
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   You're not gonna...
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   You're not gonna kick her out of bed, see you can crack her.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   Right?
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.640]   I think she's beautiful.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.760]   But see, of course, if somebody looks like that without makeup, no big deal to publish
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.920]   that picture.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.880]   Now on the other hand...
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.640]   Somebody in the chat room pointed out that Carmen Electra is 37.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.640]   She's born in 1972 and you tell me she got no makeup on.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   Look at her.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   She looks like she's 18.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.840]   But she's not exactly the middle of the bell curve.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.400]   She's from the high end of the bell curve.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   She's got great genes.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.280]   Hey, you guys can believe whatever you want.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.160]   I think in France they should put a statement on everything.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.080]   Anytime a model made wears makeup, this is...
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.880]   This person has been chemically enhanced.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.720]   This is not how she looks.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.960]   Hey, we used to wear makeup.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.960]   I was like me, but I'm wearing makeup right now.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.960]   Right now.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.000]   Yeah, no, I should say that.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.040]   I should say this is what I look up.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   Looked like.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   Fire it up on a lower third.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   Without makeup.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.960]   Let's see that lower third up there.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   What do you think?
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.640]   I think you're a dove ad waiting to have it.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.520]   Before, not after.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.720]   Oh goodness gracious.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.120]   That was on Dignation.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.560]   That's where I saw that.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.120]   You guys talked about it.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.880]   You do watch the fabulous Dignation Show everybody.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.880]   Where was it?
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.880]   You were just...
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.680]   You guys go all over the place.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.200]   Were you in London at Foa?
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.840]   No, that's next week.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   Next week.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.440]   We're not doing a Dignation out there, but I'll be out there for the conference.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.040]   I was invited to Foa, but I can't go because I'm stuck.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   Let's Foa.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.480]   Future of web applications.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480]   You did a big one.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.280]   That was where you did the gigantic one.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.440]   That was a huge one here.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.280]   Was it last year, the year before?
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280]   Huge.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.280]   Future of web application.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.280]   You should go out next year.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   It's a lot of fun out there.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.760]   I'm afraid that I would be arrested in extra.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.920]   I did to Switzerland.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.640]   I don't want to leave the country.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   It happened.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   Did you hear what happened?
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.640]   Roman Polanski.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.680]   Yeah, I think it was last night.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   They caught him.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   Yeah, he's 76.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:04.120]   They can't get Osama bin Laden, but boy, they got Roman Polanski.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:09.360]   What's weird about it is that he's been vacationing there on and off for like 20, 30 years.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.560]   And all of a sudden, somebody noticed.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.440]   I'm with you, Patrick.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.440]   Something's fishy.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.000]   Fishy.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Very fishy.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Okay.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.160]   Next news item.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:25.800]   Weirdly paced, oddly paced show today.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.240]   Well, let's do a commercial then.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.000]   Because the pace is so on anyway.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Touche.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Touche.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.760]   You know what I said?
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.560]   I told my staff when I walked in here.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.120]   It's kind of, I don't know if you know this, but getting ready for twit, it's like a bullfight.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:48.360]   I go out in the lounge and I've got my staff and they wrap the thing around me and they
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:55.440]   hear the, you know, and then the door opens and I come in here and it's like, so I tell
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.600]   them as they're wrapping me, it was the girdle to get ready for the show.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.560]   I said, today I will do a 45 minute twit.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.720]   They didn't believe me.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.840]   But I will today and you will get the bull's ears, Patrick Norton.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.320]   Oh, yes.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.320]   Yes.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.880]   The ears are for you.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.200]   Very tasty because you today are not wearing any makeup.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   Are you?
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   No, no, it is real genuine.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.960]   I don't think you even shaved.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.560]   You're not helping yourself in this 45 minute twit.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.640]   I don't think you even shaved for the show today.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.480]   Let me tell you my friends about Squarespace.com.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.160]   This is the great- I spent 23 hours of sleep on Friday night, dude.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.040]   I'm lucky to be vertical at this point.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.040]   Wow.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.720]   You mean you didn't sleep for 23 hours or you didn't?
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:49.920]   No, no, I slept from 6 p.m. on Friday till almost 3 p.m. on Saturday.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.920]   What was it?
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:57.720]   A combination of hosting a movie for Paramount, a movie opening that started on midnight.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:03.440]   And so by the time the movie was over and I got out of that, it was, I want to say, 3
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.680]   30, almost 4 by the time I got home and got to sleep and the baby woke up.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.840]   They're scary.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.720]   It was very scary.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   What?
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   They were actually-
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.720]   They were actually-
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.440]   The baby waking up is always scary.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   What was the movie?
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.920]   It was paranormal activity.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.680]   Yeah, I've started seeing some buzz about that.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.160]   What is it about?
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.040]   Well, it's about bad stuff happening to a couple.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.480]   Is it a documentary?
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   Not exactly.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   Like Blair, what did it mean?
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.400]   I think it was made for like 10 grand, right?
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   Or something like that?
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.480]   It's made for like no money.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.680]   It's basically the really good use of timing.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.840]   Minimal special effects.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   Spooky is all hell.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.560]   Oh, it's like the- What was that movie?
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.560]   Blair Witch Hunt.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.560]   Blair Witch Hunt.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.560]   Blair Witch Hunt.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   Do you say that?
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.480]   That'd be the Blair Witch Project.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.480]   Kevin said-
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.480]   Did he say it?
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   Oh.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   So it's like Blair Witch Project.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   He's mumbling.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.320]   But would you say it's like the Blair Witch Project?
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.400]   You know, I've managed to actually- By the time I had a chance to see the Blair Witch
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.160]   Project, it was so hyped.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.680]   I knew there was no way it could be nearly as good as like the 9 months of hype I'd
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.680]   heard.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.880]   So I just never bothered to see it.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.440]   I never bothered to see it because everyone kept telling me they got seasick watching
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.440]   it.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:25.560]   Yeah, here's another picture of Carmel Electric with that makeup that's not quite so flattering.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.680]   Of course, she's making a face.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   There you go.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   That's more like it.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.760]   But she's still got makeup on.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   Look over her eyes.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   That's makeup.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   How do you know so much about eye makeup, Don?
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.280]   Actually, my first wife used to be a makeup artist.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.840]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.040]   I think that answers that.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.840]   Your first wife was a makeup artist.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.840]   Yeah, she did.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   I spent her spare time.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.840]   She was.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   She could.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.240]   Some of it come over the house for dinner or something.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.240]   It would be.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.160]   It walked out of there was like, wow, it doesn't even look like the same person dying.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.160]   You're John.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.720]   Take a look at this video.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.240]   What do you think makeup?
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.640]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.040]   She looks like a different person.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   She looks like a.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:10.360]   Yeah, but you know, it's like it's these are paparazzi shots from an unflattering angle
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:16.920]   probably designed by a certain name of meh, you know, insert name of mega tabloid that
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.600]   basically thrives on doing obnoxious things to celebrities on the cover to push magazines
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   off the newsstand.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.880]   I mean, Kevin, God help me if he gets a little bit larger.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.040]   We're going to start seeing weird shots of Kevin drinking.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.040]   I'll fluff.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.040]   No, wait.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.360]   Kevin Rose like climbing up the hill in San Francisco, you know, on the end, you know,
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   mouth open or something.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.320]   And it's like, you know, we forget the fact that the French are so paranoid like we have
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.680]   to tell if these are photoshopped.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:49.080]   And it's like the entire act of putting someone in a studio, having them professionally lit,
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.280]   professionally made up professionally, post exactly photographed under perfect light by
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.600]   a photographer who's basically an artist and alchemist with light.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.440]   You know, the mirror fact that we don't even bother to point that is a sad statement on
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.920]   how we treat basically the image.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.600]   So like I think they should point that on every frickin ad.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.040]   And then on top of that, they can point out the photo shopping.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.760]   In fact, if you don't know that, you know, you're not really paying attention.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.120]   Most people don't know that.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.360]   But that's what kids need to learn.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.360]   This is called media.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.640]   This is, I mean, this is,
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.640]   people don't know that John, but it doesn't, it does not mitigate the impact that the series
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.800]   of images have on people, especially young women in their form.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.200]   I'm just totally agree with you.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   I'm just saying.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.200]   I'm just a fan of your former.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.440]   Oh, you guys in the Dove evolution?
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.920]   That was the best campaign along these lines ever.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.920]   Absolutely.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   That really did the job.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.400]   That shows what they can do with Photoshop for people who didn't see it.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.360]   It was an interesting that Dove did it.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.440]   It was an ad campaign or a video that showed.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.440]   I think it's on YouTube.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.440]   Just YouTube Dove.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.440]   What is it?
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.440]   Dove evolution.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   Evolution.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.440]   Well worth seeing.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.440]   Well worth seeing.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.440]   All right.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   I have quite a million views.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.440]   Wow.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   You know, there's an amazing new service for building websites.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.440]   Leah, why don't you tell us a little bit about it?
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.440]   Thank you, Madrick.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:11.360]   I'm here standing at Top Squares Base Mountain, where we are about to build a brand new website
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.640]   for somebody in the audience.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   Squarespace.com.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.400]   Actually, Kevin Rose's site is based on Squarespace.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   Indeed.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   One of these days we'll get-
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.840]   Did he build on Squarespace?
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.840]   No, not dig.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.840]   His blog.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.840]   I dig.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.840]   He gets me run on-
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.280]   Actually, he's telling me one.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.320]   Not a bad idea.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.640]   Squarespace is, I think they're using some interesting Java technology that allows them
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.680]   to ramp up, you know what it's great for if you get dug.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.840]   You never run out of bandwidth with Squarespace.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:45.120]   Like the servers are all virtual and can build up amazing stuff too.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120]   If you want to build a site-
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:52.280]   Now, I don't want to say blog because Squarespace could be a photo gallery, it could be a forum.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.920]   They have templates for a huge number of different kinds of websites.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.160]   So here's what I want you to do.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.160]   This is absolutely free.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.160]   We do this now.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.520]   I think almost every one of our sponsors has a free trial.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.280]   I think this is really great because you're smart people.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.880]   You've got to try it before you buy it.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.880]   So this is the deal.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.000]   Go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.200]   No credit card, nothing.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.840]   You'll be literally have a site.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.840]   You're done.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.200]   They say, "What do you want to call it?"
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.120]   "Leoville, you're done."
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:27.600]   Now you can import seamlessly from your existing blog, whether it's WordPress or TypePad or
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.240]   Blogger right in and right out.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   So nothing's trapped in there.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.640]   They've got an iPhone app, makes it very easy to blog from the iPhone.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.040]   That's coming soon.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:41.960]   The statistics, the templates that are gorgeous but very easy to modify using Ajax, forums,
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.440]   photo galleries, social integration with all the sites, including Dig.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.480]   This is a really nice, really wonderful service.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.400]   You could try it right now.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   Absolutely free.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.400]   No credit card required.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.240]   Just go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:01.880]   If you decide to sign up, and I think you will, I hope you do, as little as $8 a month,
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.280]   including that includes hosting the software, everything.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.720]   Here's the coupon code "twit" for 10% off.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.600]   Squarespace, it is the best.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:20.200]   After all these scary stories about WordPress hacks and so forth, it's nice to be on a hosted
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.840]   site where you don't have to worry about that.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.760]   They just keep it up to date.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   I'm constantly...
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   Yeah, my site got...
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   What?
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.760]   Really?
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.760]   Before the upgrade.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   Well, they somehow...
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   Because we know one of the bloggers noticed that if you type in typically...
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.560]   I guess people keep checking on this.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.200]   If you just type in the Vorac or John the Vorac, you would always have the same kind of listing
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:47.360]   on Google and would always be headlined by the one or two spot, the Vorac Uncensored Blog.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   Right.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   Disappeared.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.960]   Okay, Google blocks it if it's got malware on it.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.080]   Yeah, I wasn't malware.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.720]   Apparently in the front template, at the very bottom, there's a whole bunch of just
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   keywords that were dropped into gambling and porn and just a whole slew of keywords with
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.720]   links.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.960]   I didn't know what they were trying to accomplish.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.560]   But somebody from Google pointed out that this is when they see this, they just basically
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.120]   quarantine the site because they don't know what's going on.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.480]   And so it takes about two days to get it back and get rid of all that crap.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.880]   Yeah, it's very scary having a scoble.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.440]   I update...
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.440]   But this is what you have to do.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.320]   If you run your own WordPress blog, you got to check all the time if there's a new one
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   and updated immediately.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.840]   So you don't have to worry about this, Kevin.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.840]   You're smart.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.640]   Kevin's going to pee.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.040]   Yeah, that's the part of the problems.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.840]   I think that there's the people that are super, super, like, you know, their own developers
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.800]   and they want to go the extra mile to customize everything in like crazy, crazy ways.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.040]   And then there's like Squarespace.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.960]   It's in that spot for me where it'll do 99.9% of the stuff I need to do.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.280]   And so I don't ever have to do anything but just write articles.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.920]   And when I log in, there's a new interface like every few months because they upgrade
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   it.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.240]   It's kind of nice just to think about content and not about anything else.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.520]   Especially you spend your day, you know, all day thinking about dig.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.320]   Yeah, the last thing you want to do is come home and start...
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.080]   Not enough hours in the day.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.040]   I could have had them do it.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.040]   I don't know.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.040]   I did a search for you, John.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040]   I did find your Devorek on censored blog.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:18.480]   But then the image results for John C. Devorek are a little odd.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.320]   One of these things does not belong.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.720]   One of these pictures.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   But it's wrong with these pictures.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.720]   Yeah, they're...
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.360]   Why do I see three, four pictures of John C. Devorek and one picture of Steve Jobs?
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.240]   Yeah, holding an iPhone.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   Very strange.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.240]   Actually, it doesn't look like a...
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.480]   It's an unhappy iPhone.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   There's a little...
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.840]   Oh, maybe that was...
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.840]   This is not a joke.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.160]   Oh, there it is.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.640]   See, and right under it says John C. Devorek.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.880]   So Google's not wrong.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.880]   Look, see?
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.360]   Yeah, Google's never wrong.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.240]   Google's got it again.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.320]   So here's the story that I think was interesting.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   Good, please.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.440]   The Texas police trying to bust blog commentators.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.080]   Well, this is...
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   You know, okay.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:11.720]   So what's happening is that people are saying bad things about the chief of police.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.520]   And I don't know what they call them.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.800]   The sheriff, the ranger.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.000]   What do they call it, Texas guy?
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.760]   We'll say the chief of police.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:23.720]   And he's investigating to see whether he can shut him down.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.120]   Maybe arrest him.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.000]   Take him away.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.840]   Put him where the sun don't shine.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.800]   Most amused by people in this day and age.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.880]   You know, we had the, I guess the personal computer revolution began, what, 35 years
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   ago.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:44.360]   And then the internet revolution began, what, 15 years ago.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.440]   And there's these people that apparently don't have anything...
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.080]   I mean, a clue how anything works.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.080]   It's like...
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   It came from the...
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.000]   The Knights in Shining Armor.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.560]   Austin police chief Art Acevedo, according to the Austin American Statesman, is considering
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:02.360]   pursuing commentators on blogs who have one impersonated him.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.360]   Have you ever been impersonated?
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.360]   I...
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.360]   Yes.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.360]   We all have.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.360]   We all have.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.360]   Sure.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.680]   I think the world works very, very different if you're a senior lawman in Texas than it
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:19.280]   does if you're a news commenter in the East Bay, John.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.760]   Or malign them, he says, beyond the boundaries of legal tolerance.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.360]   Whatever that might be.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.360]   Libel.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.280]   Well, they're saying not only libel suits, but criminal charges if police believe these
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.120]   are warranted.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.840]   A lot of my people feel it's time to take these people on.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.560]   They understand the damage to the organization.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:40.200]   And quite frankly, when people are willfully misleading and lying, they're pretty much cowards
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:46.920]   anyway, because they're doing so under the cloaks of anonymity.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.080]   I don't like this trend.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:55.000]   Remember this article on CNET also refers to that skanks in New York City case where the
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.040]   Google was forced to give up the name of a blogger who wrote bad things about a model.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.400]   It's the same thing.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.480]   If you're a public figure, I don't know.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.480]   It's pretty hard to...
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.480]   I know.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.480]   But I mean, it depends on whether there's libel involved.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.320]   I mean, it's liableing and slandering, you know, and there's...
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.400]   You maybe you have a point, but generally speaking, most people who do this sort of thing are
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.160]   just goofs and they're posting on so's a...
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.720]   And they sign up the sheriff.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.720]   I mean, it's...
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.440]   I can't get him worked up about it.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.680]   Well, I wouldn't mess with the Texas law, man.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.640]   Hmm.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   Did you...
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.520]   I should cuss at him when I see him.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.080]   They don't seem to care.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.520]   You're the kind of guy who...
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:49.000]   I did that when you were young, long-haired, hippie and Berkeley at Cal and University of
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.200]   California, Berkeley, probably you'd do that.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.200]   Did you call him pigs?
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.640]   Texas to cuss at a lawman or call the Berkeley police officer.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.640]   A pig.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   A pig.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   We love law enforcement folks.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.640]   So there's a...
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   You know, my favorite...
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.280]   There used to be a guy that was on...
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.280]   I think...
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.640]   Isn't until recently on Telegraph Avenue.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:10.200]   So all these crazy bumper stickers, I mean, they were just the wildest ones and they're
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:15.920]   all just nutty, extreme communist bumper stickers.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:22.120]   But he had this one that I always thought was amusing and said, "F you see the police."
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.120]   And it just says...
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.720]   And it's just a beautiful sticker and it also buttons that said that.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   But no, can't.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.720]   I've always...
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.720]   What?
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   No, K.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   Yeah, there was a K on there.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.720]   Oh, there was a K2, okay.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   It was the real deal.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.680]   And so you can buy these sticks for a buck.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.280]   So if you found somebody you didn't like and you could just...
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.720]   Put it on their car.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   Exactly.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:44.360]   You put it on their rear end bumper and they're just driving around endlessly and I'm sure
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.320]   that the police really got a kick out of that.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:51.280]   It's like putting a kick me sign in a guy in high school.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   That little...
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.680]   No, it's a little worse.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.680]   Oh, man.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.080]   Go ahead, take that call.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.040]   Sorry, maybe it's the Texas police.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.040]   Hello.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:06.360]   She's going to be back in about three hours.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:12.560]   So did you get your Fitbit yet, Kevin?
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.480]   No, they haven't.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.880]   I haven't even spoken to anyone over a Fitbit.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.880]   So this was a pick.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.880]   This was your pick.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.520]   I remember you were on after Tech Croats.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.320]   I was like TC40 last year.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.320]   Here we go.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.960]   And you were a judge and that wasn't the best of.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   The Yammer was the best of.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.080]   Which apparently he's still doing quite well.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:34.320]   Jason told me that they're doing quite well as a kind of enterprise Twitter.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.880]   But you liked and I thought very interesting the Fitbit.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.880]   And they're finally coming out.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:42.000]   They're a little late.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   Is it a pedometer?
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   What is it?
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.640]   So, I mean, essentially it's something, it's a little device that is about a little bit
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.760]   small than a pack of gum.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.920]   You either clip it on a wristband or on your waist and you just go about your day, right?
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:02.480]   So you're just walking around, you could go to the gym, you might walk to lunch and
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.560]   you keep it on you when you sleep as well.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:11.040]   And then it sinks back to your computer and then pushes all that data about your movement
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.160]   to the website.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.880]   And then you see basically how your sleep was where you're moving around a lot and you're
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.880]   asleep.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:24.560]   Supposedly it tells you how many calories you burned and how the distance that you traveled.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:30.120]   I don't know how accurate it is, but it's kind of, I don't know, in my mind, these devices
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120]   are going to take off soon.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   I love this.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   It's a sleep side of it.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.560]   I mean, pedometer is one thing, but I love how well did you sleep?
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.960]   I think you might as well get chipped while we're at it.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:46.160]   This is just a, this is like, I mean, there's a lot of different things that are happening
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.320]   in the space right now, right?
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.120]   You got the Nike Plus, which is the same thing but inside of your shoe.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:56.280]   And that's built into all iPhones now and, you know, all iPod touches.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.560]   So when you go to the gym, you know, you exercise, you run down the street, it tells
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.600]   you the distance and calories and all that stuff and even like pushes like your favorite
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.840]   song when you're supposed to be hitting your maximum.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.400]   They call it like your, I can't remember like your personal.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.960]   You push something like that.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.960]   Something like that.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:14.920]   And I even saw recently there was a, there was a new treadmill, or not treadmill, but a
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:20.160]   new bike at the gym that you sit down on and you plug your iPhone into it and it's Nike
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160]   Plus compatible.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.280]   And so you don't even need the shoes anymore.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.200]   It just tracks all of your calories and your distance and everything and then uploads it
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   back to the website.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:31.880]   So when you log on later, it shows you exactly, you know, how you've been doing compared to
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.120]   previous times that you exercise.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.280]   How many people are actually using the Nike Fit?
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.280]   I don't.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.120]   But I know a lot of runners do, I think.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.920]   I think it's, it's one of these things where Nike, I mean, it's cheap for Nike.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.560]   The device itself is, you know, 10 to 15 bucks.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.200]   And if they can lock people into this and create like this experience online where you
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.080]   go there and you share with your friends like the different workouts that you're doing,
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.120]   you can map out different trails that you go on and share it with other people.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.880]   If they could own that market, then you're always going to be buying Nike shoes, right?
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.480]   Because they own the patent on the little slide in thing on the shoe.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.640]   I'm buying a Fit there right now.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.200]   I think it's so they're available now.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   People are getting them.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.280]   I guess it's a month or so until they ship them out.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.280]   Shoot.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.000]   So you probably would want to like, because if you're going to wear it when you sleep,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.920]   you'd have to wear it like all the time.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.120]   I mean, they have like a little place.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.920]   It would imply that, yes.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.000]   You could just guess.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   There's actually a shower.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.120]   You're going off a lot of energy in the shower or you're scrubbing yourself down.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.120]   Thank you for the pleasure.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.960]   And it seems like you need to have this waterproof.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.360]   This device is a waterproof.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   I like this.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   For sure.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.360]   Jimmy, look at the cell phone you got.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.360]   Isn't that great?
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:47.280]   By the way, I've been trying to get one of those big old clunkers.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.800]   I think you can still get them there and there.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.520]   Oh, wouldn't it be kind like the retrofit one so it's an actual cell phone network?
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:59.240]   It's cool if you're at a conference and your phone rings and you plug this gigantic cell
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.440]   phone and start talking on it.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.240]   I think that'd be, you know, that's what was.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.360]   Did we get the big labs today?
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.840]   Waz took an old dial phone, you know, like an old Western electric black rubber dial
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.520]   phone and put cell phone electronics in it.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:17.520]   He talks on the phone.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.520]   This is good.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.320]   This is one of our listeners made this image of John.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.840]   It says on location in Caracas.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:27.840]   He's on now on when you're when I have video, that's the picture we're going to show John.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.880]   I just want to thank you.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.880]   Consider yourself.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.880]   It's a war.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   It's a war.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.880]   I've warned.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.800]   Miko is a good place to go for those, by the way, John.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   Miko.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   Miko.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.800]   Miko.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   It's guy.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.920]   Actually, he's probably not too far from where you are right now who deals in a lot of surplus
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.720]   electronics of vintage electronics.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.120]   He shows up at Def Con every year.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   Oh, cool.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.400]   He's a couple of those people like him for the three watt amplifiers inside of him.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.400]   The big fat honking cell phone amplifier.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.680]   So it's still, but it's an analog cell phone.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.800]   So it wouldn't, you'd have to modify it, right?
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:03.920]   Well, what you do is you basically people tweak around with the, people play around
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.680]   with the actual amplification sections of the phone without dealing with the analog section.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:12.080]   Basically, they turn it into a cell phone booster.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:15.280]   You put a little cell phone inside it.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.600]   Cook, get brain.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.120]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:22.040]   I think both of them still pale by comparison to the logic energy that's hitting your skull
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   from the sun.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.040]   Oh, good.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.640]   So as long as you stay out of the sun, you're okay.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   Exactly.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:33.600]   Supposedly, maybe, maybe, Kevin, you shouldn't modify your Macbook Pro just yet because according
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   to Apple Insider, Apple is about to announce new models of laptops.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.800]   Now see, nobody knows.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:48.760]   So this is one of those rumors, but they say that they will update the Mac books, the cheap
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:55.320]   white polycarbonate Macbooks and come up with a much or somewhat cheaper laptop, the cheapest
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:00.000]   Mac laptop, they say, in Apple history.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.360]   I think given the sales on the netbooks, that's probably a good idea.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.040]   That's what all those 10 end screens were for.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.000]   Wouldn't that break everybody's heart?
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.720]   Oh, man, they put it in a Macbook.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   What are you now?
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.480]   I have this conversation on Mac break weekly every week and you know, those guys are really
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.800]   excited about the idea of an Apple tablet.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.520]   I keep saying it's, I don't know if there's a market for a 10 inch tablet, touch tablet.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.400]   Is there a market for this?
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:31.280]   I've actually found myself, I was in a huge conversation slash argument with Callie Lewis
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:37.120]   of all people about how an Apple tablet would be just worthless.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.760]   And then about six months later, I was trying to use the GPS on my iPhone and it occurred
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:45.760]   to me just exactly how much more usable all the iPhone applications would be on a larger
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.760]   screen.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.120]   I just was thinking seven or eight inch.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.440]   I think 10 inch may be too big.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.800]   Because you can't put that in your pocket.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:56.280]   No, but there's a lot of things we're like, and you look like an idiot when you use it
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   as a phone.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   Well, it's not going to be a phone.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.760]   I don't think it's going to be a phone.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.760]   It won't be a phone.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   It won't be a phone.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.120]   It'll have, it'll have a high speed, you know, three.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   Oh, mom.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.600]   Hi, well, you'll look that'll look just like, you know, here we are.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:12.520]   We're just saying how we would like to have one of those old fashioned big cell phones,
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.680]   but oh no, if Apple makes it giant slab, I'm not using it because that's modern.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.960]   Well, I just, I just wonder when you think about the device, I mean, you can, you see
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.720]   all these Photoshop concepts and everything and it looks really cool and you're like,
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.320]   wow, they look nice, you know, sitting on my desk.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.560]   But really, you know, when I'm out and about, what do I want to do?
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.720]   I want to be able to look up something real quick on Google.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.680]   I want to be able to check my email.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:37.480]   I want to be able to maybe surf a webpage real quick if I need to pull up something.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.640]   All those things I can do very well on the iPhone, right?
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:42.880]   And if it's anything above and beyond that, I have my notebook, right?
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.880]   It's pretty light.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:48.440]   Carried around and then I pop it open and boom, I'm on Wi-Fi and I have a full keyboard.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:52.600]   Where would this device sit and what would I use it for that I couldn't do on my iPhone?
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.600]   Right.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   I just, I don't know.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   I get hanked on the wall and make it a picture frame that shows your photos.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.760]   It rotates through the photos.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.760]   Nice.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.200]   It's only not a picture frame.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.360]   And I would probably buy it because it's an Apple device.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.280]   Well, did you see the Microsoft Courier?
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.280]   Gizmodo showed this now.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:17.760]   You know, Gizmodo does not have the greatest track record on, I don't want to say veracity,
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.640]   but you know, sometimes they say things maybe I don't know if they're completely true.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:28.600]   They say you're questioning whether this is somebody's backyard Photoshop mockup or
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.640]   a genuine real Microsoft potential product.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.560]   I'd say consider this source.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.680]   Gizmodo has the video.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.600]   Did you watch the video?
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.560]   This I would buy as opposed to a 10 inch because first of all, it's a book.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.800]   It opens, right?
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:54.400]   And it's got both, it's got touch, but it also has stylus.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.760]   So it's kind of a hybrid thing and that kind of makes sense.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:02.800]   That's exactly what I would expect from Microsoft because of course they did those tablets.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.280]   And the use case that they showed in the video was kind of neat.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.640]   It was a woman who was outside of the client, so she was sitting at whatever, an internet
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.640]   cafe.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.560]   She opens the book, she drags.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.960]   It's a file of facts.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.040]   Yeah, it's a file of facts with, but electronic.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.440]   And the other thing I like about it, and I think that the Apple tablet would have some
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.320]   of this as well is that it is also an ebook device.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.840]   Did you notice that that while you're showing the video, I'll see it on the podcast necessarily,
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.560]   but they're doing it, the two finger stuff.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.000]   Have they given their, I thought Apple had that look down?
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.600]   No, no, because the surface has the pinch and so does the pre lot of devices have the,
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600]   have the pinch.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.560]   What was this patent and that Apple has the two touch screen?
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.560]   I don't know.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.560]   I'm multi touch, whatever they call it.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.640]   Well, I don't know because a lot of people are doing it.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.720]   I don't think, I mean, the guy who demonstrated it, Carnegie Mellon had this demonstration
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.120]   was well before the, the iPhone.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.320]   Remember that demo?
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.040]   It wasn't Carnegie Mellon was another school.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   Yeah, so I remember what you're talking about.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.760]   And he, he demoed it was a twit, a TED speech and head.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.120]   Did you give your Ted speech yet?
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.120]   Well, it's TEDx.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.080]   Now I have to say that because Kevin like goes to the real Ted.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.680]   I go to the franchise Ted.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.640]   It's like he's going to the French laundry or, you know, sir, I've never been to you
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.920]   go into Buschon and I'm going to Mickey D's.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.520]   No, but it is in Dubai.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.520]   So that's exciting.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.520]   No, it's October.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   You're going to Dubai.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.000]   I'm going to Dubai in a couple of weeks.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   That's amazing.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.720]   Make sure Dubai stuff because it's a chopper's paradise.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720]   Well, but aren't they go?
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.000]   I heard that they were kind of going through a little bit of an economic.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   It's the music.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   These will be on sale.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   I mean, that place is like, wow.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   Well, it's like the feeling of the talk.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.600]   Well, so there's TEDx, you know, there's been a lot of, there are a lot of TEDxes.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.760]   These are the franchise Ted's.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.120]   So there's Toronto just had theirs and they're all over.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.360]   Dubai, a guy emailed me, George, you said, hey, I'd like to do one in Dubai.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.360]   Would you come if I did one?
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360]   I said, are you kidding?
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.360]   You pay my ticket.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.360]   I'm there.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.280]   It's kind of funny because I'm flying 26 hours for an 18 minute speech.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   It's miserable.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   That flight.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.840]   Well, I'm on Emirates.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840]   I'm on business class.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   And on Emirates is fun.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840]   You're sad.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.840]   So it should be OK.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840]   Not first.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.680]   In first class in Emirates, apparently you get a room, like a cabin.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.360]   But I'm not first class.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.920]   I'm just business is all you need.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.760]   Yeah, I'll be fine.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   I'm excited.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   I can't wait.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   Yeah, it's a couple of weeks.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.520]   We're Alex Lindsay's going to fill in all week on Twitter.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.600]   This is an experiment to see if in fact this whole network can survive without me.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.200]   And if it can, I'm staying in Dubai.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.800]   Well, if you made sure that it's actually a conference, not somebody, you know, I'm going
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.640]   to hold you hostage or something.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.640]   To me.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.880]   They have a website.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.400]   Buy is hot.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.400]   It's really hot.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   It's 100 degree.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.400]   I've been watching the weather all summer.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   It's like a hundred days.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.720]   You're not going to go outside noon to four.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.760]   You nobody goes outside between noon and four.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760]   Well, don't they?
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.720]   But now Kevin, you've been to Ted.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   Haven't you spoken to Ted?
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.720]   I thought you'd.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720]   No, no, no, no.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.720]   I've just attended.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.000]   Well, I'm hoping the 12 days, six hours and 48 minutes.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   This is a real honor.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   They offer you.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   I'm hugely honored.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Are you kidding?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.040]   To speak at Ted is a big deal.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.440]   Well, but it's not.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]   But it is.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.040]   It's still hard to go to these things.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.040]   Like this is.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040]   I'm hoping that this.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040]   That's congrats.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.160]   It's the trouble is they get the problem is that you don't understand Kevin is that you
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.160]   don't know.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.160]   Leo's.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.680]   He'll tell you about this, but his speech is going to be about how to work a microphone
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.080]   so you get to write tones.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.000]   Yeah, but that's okay.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   Isn't that allowed?
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   You can talk about anything you want.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   Well, all right.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   All right.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   All right.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   All right, Mr. John C. Dvorak.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.240]   If you were giving a Ted talk, what would you do?
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.680]   What would you Ted talk be?
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.680]   Well, I talk.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.200]   I feel I have absolutely nothing to treat.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.720]   I would refuse the honor.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.760]   No, you wouldn't.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.560]   Would you really have to dream something up then?
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.080]   I mean, I have got nothing.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   Oh, come on.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.840]   I mean, so when you listen to the show, I'm just here to to to kibbitz, you know, and
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:14.040]   to throw in one liners when I have a shot at it and then a chief on a grind and you know,
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040]   reporting.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:18.440]   It could be like a retake mile wrestling coaches philosophy on life power of negative
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.440]   and let's force them on.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.440]   Let's face reality.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:26.400]   I'm giving a speech on Friday to the online news association in San Francisco and the
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.760]   speech is going to is titled I haven't written it yet.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   So I better write it.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.760]   But the run for your life.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.600]   Yeah, really, it's bad news everywhere.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.120]   No, my speech, I thought this was appropriate for the online news association is how a lifetime
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.800]   of failure led me to be an overnight success.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:44.600]   You'd had a lifetime of failure.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.600]   Cricuts.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.200]   All right, Patrick, what would you do if you were invited to Ted?
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.600]   What would you speak about?
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.600]   I don't think they would have me and be.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.360]   I think it's kind of a leadist.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.640]   That's given it to him, Patrick.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:01.080]   No, no, I mean, I mean, I mean, I every so often I see something amazing from it, but
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.160]   it's kind of like we're going to have the people we think are the coolest people in
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.920]   the world come talk to the people we think are doing the most good in the world, which
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   is great.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.240]   And I don't really fit under either of those concepts.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.320]   So I'd love to go to Ted, though, in Long Beach.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.240]   Are you talking about Ted or the online newspaper or social?
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.440]   So tell it what's Ted like.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.280]   Kevin, I mean, it must be pretty cool.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.360]   I would love to go to Ted, the big Ted.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.960]   I mean, it's one of these things where you definitely feel like, so last year is the
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:32.040]   first year I ever went and it felt like I was out of place because, you know, you're
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:35.680]   walk around and like, there's Bill Gates and there's Larry and Sergey and they're like,
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.840]   you can just walk up to him, which is not like normal conferences, right?
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.040]   Getting scared.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.840]   Like I better start thinking about this speech.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.440]   I hadn't really thought of I figured 18 minutes.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.360]   I'd get up there and blab.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:54.080]   So you haven't done your TEDx speech or you haven't done weirdness.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.720]   You're just thinking a million times already.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.200]   He always over prepared when he does these things.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.080]   I've heard a couple of these.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.640]   I do over prepare.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.640]   I do over prepare.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   Oh, thank you.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.640]   That's very nice, John.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   They are.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.640]   I kiss.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.240]   But the problem, the reason I over prepare is because I write it and I throw it out and
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.640]   I write another one and I throw it out because I hate them all.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.800]   And then I finally get to the stage and I confused.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.040]   You need to write one of those kind of tear jerkers.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.400]   You know, some of the best TED talks are always those really sad ones where people walk away
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.560]   and then it's like, yeah.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.560]   Oh, good.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.560]   All right.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.560]   Good.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.560]   Okay.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.560]   I need this now, Kevin.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.560]   So this is good.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.560]   So we need a little drama here.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   Pathos.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.440]   Actually, you have pathos going on in your life right now.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:38.600]   I do relate it to anonymity in the internet and how the internet's greatest strength is
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   also its greatest downfall when used irresponsibly.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600]   It is.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.240]   You know, this is a big challenge, I think.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.240]   Did you see?
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   Have you seen we live in public yet?
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:57.480]   Josh Harris, the biography of Josh Harris was the guy who created pseudo and he wired
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   his apartment.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.560]   This is like in 2001 with cameras everywhere, even in the toilet.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.760]   There was a camera in the toilet.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.640]   And you're making a motion as though it's in the toilet.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.640]   I'm really.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.640]   Yes.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.640]   In the toilet?
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.640]   That's gross.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   Yeah, it's gross.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.720]   And then microphones everywhere, all of which were activated by movement or sound.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   So basically he just walked around and everywhere he was.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.680]   And then he has his girlfriend, which he calls his fake girlfriend in there with him.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.640]   And they have the chat rooms and they just everything they do is documented and it's
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.640]   weird.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.000]   And he had, you know, I think he had a nervous breakdown.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.720]   But because he and he said that you'll have a nerve.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.440]   If you do this, you will have a nervous breakdown.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.320]   I think he told me I was going to have a nervous breakdown.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.320]   What'd you think of that movie, Kevin?
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.520]   It was pretty good, I thought.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.520]   I thought it was okay.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.120]   In my mind, it was like, I mean, the guy clearly made a lot of money in tech.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.120]   He had millions and millions of dollars and he kind of blew it all on or quite a big chunk
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.520]   of it on setting up cameras.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.520]   He was broke.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.520]   He blew it all.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   I just don't understand why one would do that.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   Like I don't know.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.480]   Well, I think it's like a waste of money to me.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:06.720]   I almost think he was a, he's a, Josh was a performance artist, not so much of it.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.680]   I was going to say this, this sounds like a lot of stuff that was going on and off off
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.480]   Broadway when I was in college in New York City.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:19.200]   It was New York in 1999, he took over the basement of a hotel, put a bunks, you know,
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.760]   like sleeping tubes in it for like, I don't know, a lot of people, 50 people or something.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:30.320]   Cameras everywhere, people moved in, they couldn't come out and they eventually got
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:38.240]   closed down by the New York City police after the 1999-2000 New Year's Eve.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.000]   But boy, I just, yeah, I think he's a performance artist is what I think he is.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.960]   Very, very east side, lower east side.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.360]   Or now lower, lower, lower east side.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.560]   Lumberbets city, baby.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.560]   No, alphabet city is almost gentrified.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560]   Is that hip now?
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.760]   Where am I going to get my heroin?
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.760]   And not here anymore.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.760]   Man.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:04.200]   There's another article here I want to discuss since I love going off track off the.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.200]   Can I do it?
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.200]   Okay.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.200]   Hold on.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.200]   I'm going to do an ad.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.200]   I got one more ad.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200]   And then- This is interesting.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.200]   That's why you should stay tuned.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.400]   No, no, no, I'm saying it's interesting that this is the second time I tried to cue a story
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.320]   and you came up with this ad thing.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.920]   Because you get this ad thing.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.240]   I'll never understand it.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.760]   What is this ad thing you do?
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.000]   How does that work?
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   What is that?
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.560]   Do people pay for those?
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.040]   What exactly is an ad?
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.520]   Well my friends, without the ads, there would be no Twitch.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.800]   You know how expensive it is to do this show?
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.520]   It costs me several dollars an hour.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.720]   That's why we ask our fine sponsors.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:47.800]   People like audible.com to defray the costs with small advertisements.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.120]   And you know, these are all products I use and love.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.360]   So I don't mind doing it.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.600]   I don't think of it as an ad.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.920]   I think of it as recommending something I enjoy.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.640]   Audible, to be honest, don't tell them this.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.320]   I probably would do these for free.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.800]   They save my life driving to tech TV, two hours, three hours a day in the car.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.800]   Flying to Dubai.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.800]   Flying to Dubai.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.800]   I'm stocking up.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.120]   In fact, I'll show you my library because I actually started--
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.880]   Bring a battery booster for your iPod.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880]   Yeah, I do.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.840]   I have the fast track.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.360]   And I think it's going to get me all the way.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360]   Well wait a minute.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.360]   No, I'm on--
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360]   Yeah, power outlets and business costs.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.560]   I could plug in everything.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.840]   So Lucifer's Hammer, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournell, that's about 30 hours.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.280]   Got the new Chris Anderson free.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.840]   That's free by the way, on Audible.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.960]   Kind of makes sense.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.400]   Andy and Aco recommend a book about the golden age of movies.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.200]   You know, the '70s with easy rider and raging bulls called easy riders, raging bulls, the
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.720]   history of Hollywood in the '70s.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.720]   The Battle for America 2008.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.680]   I'm going to listen to all of these on the plane.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.840]   I'm actually kind of excited.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.120]   The Innovators Dilemma, which I've been meaning to read for years.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.800]   Ben Mezrich's book about Facebook, the accidental billionaires.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.240]   By the way, they're going to start filming that.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.240]   That's pretty exciting.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.960]   Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.520]   Who's directing?
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   They got a great director.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.600]   I can't remember who it is.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.120]   Kevin Spacey's company, Trigger Street is producing it.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.200]   I'm excited about this.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.200]   The accidental billionaires.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.280]   I know Mark Zuckerberg is not as excited about this, but so I'm going to listen to
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.280]   this.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.800]   This is the story of Facebook by Ben Mezrich.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.560]   He's a guy who wrote 21.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560]   That great book about this would be a good Audible pick.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.200]   I'll tell you what, let's make this our Audible pick.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.320]   You can go there and get this for free.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.160]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.000]   Listen to the books I'm listening on the way to Dubai.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.120]   You get two books when you sign up for the platinum account.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.600]   The platinum account is two books a month.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.440]   First two books are free.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.720]   By the way, you get to keep those books.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.760]   Even if you decide not to stick around, I know you will.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.080]   Audible is 60,000 books.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:50.520]   It's the best library of audio entertainment in the world.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.280]   Some of the best books ever read by the best performers.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.640]   You're just going to love it.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.880]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.560]   Try it right now.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.720]   Your first two books are free.

[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.720]   They'll save your life if you get the gym.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.680]   Drive it in the car.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.960]   Do it housework.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.800]   There's just nothing better than listen to Audible.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.000]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.560]   We thank you so much for their support of this week and tech.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.800]   Now, John C. Devorek has an actually interesting story to tell us.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.360]   I don't remember.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.880]   Oh, come on.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.880]   OK, here.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.880]   Ready?
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.880]   Yes.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:30.880]   Because Kevin's here.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.880]   I think he can maybe shed some light on us.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.440]   There was a number of studies that came out that showed that people on social networks
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.080]   really are on social networks only because they want to social.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.200]   They don't want to have stuff sold to them.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.560]   Meanwhile, this Wall Street Journal article comes out saying Twitter users twice as receptive
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.800]   to advertising.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.800]   This is bull.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.720]   You know, well, you know, why?
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.800]   I'll tell you, it's not bull.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.040]   I bet it's not bull.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.080]   And, of course, you want to ask Kevin, so I'll let Kevin talk.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.720]   But I think it's not bull because people on Twitter don't expect ads, so they get suckered
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720]   by the ads.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.360]   Oh, that's bull.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.040]   What do you think, Kevin?
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.320]   I don't know.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.240]   I think that the people on Twitter, it would be interesting to see what kind of what their
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.240]   main demo is.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:18.840]   And I think that Twitter has been able to capture a lot of people who have never blogged before,
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.360]   a lot of kind of middle America that don't know how to use computers.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.000]   I have some friends of mine that aren't into the whole tech scene, right?
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.520]   And they're like, well, Twitter just makes sense for me because it's a simple little
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.920]   box and I just fill it in.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.560]   And that's my website now.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.960]   They even call it their website, which is weird.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.960]   But--
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   Ooh, that is weird.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.960]   You know what I mean?
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.240]   No, it's like, can you imagine those people just getting online for the first time and
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.760]   using the service and then seeing an ad and being like, oh, I'll click on that?
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.080]   Isn't it true that more newbie people to the internet click more ads than more savvy
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.080]   tech savvy people?
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.520]   Well, there's a couple flaws in this, what you just said.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.000]   One, I don't think Twitter is populated with that many newbies.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.280]   Most people have some experience online before they even find Twitter or feel that it's
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.880]   useful, A, and B, I've studied this because everybody, everybody and their sister now
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:13.720]   uses Bitly, which tracks clicks and click throughs when they want to shrink a URL.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:20.320]   And so you always-- and so you can put some sales pitch into your Twitter feed.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:24.440]   This is the most amazing, unbelievable video I've ever seen.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.400]   And then you give it a little link and then you can see how many people click on it.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.720]   And it's not a substantial number.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:35.000]   I mean, there are some people that do, but it's not like something that's outrageous.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.880]   The most click-throughs I've ever gotten with my 50,000, 60,000 users, which is a good
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:48.680]   group to study, is when it said that we talked about Leo going off on Michael Arrington.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:54.000]   Everybody seemed to really want to take-- because that wasn't about anything except social.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.160]   That was pure social because the Arrington's-- they're both in the social network.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.080]   And I think it's still social networks are for good for one thing.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.640]   They're good for social networking.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.560]   I think this is a bogus report.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.120]   Well, I didn't read the report.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.760]   So what are they talking about exactly?
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.840]   What was the study all about?
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:16.760]   Survey of 9,200 internet users found Twitter users are twice as likely-- now this is what
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.760]   it is.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:18.760]   And I think this is true.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:23.680]   Twice as likely to review or rate products online.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.240]   That makes sense, right?
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.240]   That's the currency of Twitter.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.520]   I just use the Fitbit.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.520]   This is pretty cool.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:36.560]   So, visit company profiles or click on advertisements or sponsors.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:43.120]   They say 20% of Twitter users are likely to click on advertisements or sponsors versus
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.920]   9% who belong to traditional social networking sites.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.520]   I'm expecting spam bots as advertisers.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.960]   Yeah, because there are no Twitter ads right now.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.320]   Well, I guess they're kind of-- there's those links on the right.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.320]   That's what I thought you were first talking about.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.320]   This is compared to my--
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.320]   This is compared to my space and Facebook.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.000]   I mean, it's good news for Twitter.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.040]   Now, it's interesting this comes out right when they're getting $100 million with some
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.560]   more money and getting valued at $1 billion.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.040]   You know, John, I can almost buy into it simply because there's so little ad activity
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.440]   on Twitter.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.240]   Maybe people don't-- you know what I mean?
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.480]   People didn't really share violently reacting to ads until ads started eating really obnoxious
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.560]   on a lot of the interfaces when the eyeblasters and other stuff came in.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.920]   So maybe it's because they're reacting so mildly to it because just haven't seen any
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.040]   advertising activity or maybe they don't realize that they're not even seeing any advertising
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040]   activity.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:40.080]   Well, until I see raw numbers or actual sales figures, somebody who's made Twitter a channel,
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.800]   let's say, for selling stuff.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.280]   I'm very skeptical of this.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.240]   Twitter does thrive a lot of traffic, right?
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.480]   I do have one point of data that was pretty interesting to us at Dig.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.320]   Because we have this feed called Dig 2000.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.720]   It's like Dig_2000 on Twitter.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.760]   And it's only stories that have 2000 or more digs.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:07.080]   And we found that the users that come from that feed consume more pages per visit, not
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.560]   ad clicks, but pages per visit than other people just coming in from search or from other
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.360]   ways of finding the story.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.920]   But that's a really quality feed.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.360]   I mean, if it's dug 2,000 times.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360]   Right.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360]   But not just that one page--
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360]   That's a subscriber that feed.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.760]   I can say it's all over the map.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:28.600]   But once they come into Dig, they go several pages deep versus if someone comes in from
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:32.480]   a Google search, it's typically bouncing off and then going into something else.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.480]   Wow.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.720]   This Dig 2000 has almost a million followers.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720]   Holy cow.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:43.000]   That's numbers just stagger me.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   They are kind of-- I mean, it's a variety of--
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   What?
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.200]   Let's say you post something right now on Dig 2000.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.640]   You have a million followers.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.640]   What number of people will generally--
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640]   What are they saying?
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.200]   --have to be involved here?
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.080]   As far as the add of those millions--
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.720]   How many links do you get there?
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.720]   Yeah, let me click through.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.720]   Oh, clicks.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.720]   I don't know.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:04.720]   I have to go check with people.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.920]   Well, I mean, it's like this car that saw this car parked outside my apartment today.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.920]   Pick.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.920]   It's got a picture.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.920]   And then it's got a link.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.680]   You should be able to count those links.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.680]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.160]   I'm not sure he knows, but it does--
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:18.440]   I'm thinking somewhere on the 20, 30, 40,000 range.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.440]   Whoa.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.440]   Holy cow.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.440]   It depends on--
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.560]   How did you get a million-- this must have been on the suggested users list, right?
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.480]   Yeah, it was on there for a while.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.880]   It's the only way I ever seen anybody get to a million.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:29.880]   Yeah, everybody but me.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.880]   I don't care.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:31.880]   That's fine.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:32.880]   Yes.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.880]   No, I don't.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.880]   I do.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:35.880]   I don't want to be a club who would have me--
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.880]   And I care for you, Leo.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.040]   I think you got ripped off.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.040]   Oh, you're just trying to get me going.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.040]   You are.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.040]   No, I'm telling you.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.040]   It's a fact.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.880]   I brought this up last time I was on the show, and I still believe it's true, because you
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.280]   have a show called Twit, and these lawyers over there at Twitter probably weren't sick
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.280]   that they--
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.280]   You know, there was an interesting--
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:56.800]   There was an interesting-- I think Dave Weiner did this.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:04.920]   He took the Twitter counter graph of Michael Arrington's followers, and he was on the suggested
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.800]   users list right up to the point where he published those confidential Twitter documents,
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   and he never showed up in the S.U.L.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   again.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:17.840]   And the graph of his followers is very, very steep, and then as soon as he's off the S.U.L.,
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.280]   it flattens right out.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.360]   So what does show-- There's two things you get from that.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.280]   One, that S.U.L. makes a huge difference in the number of followers.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.440]   That makes sense.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:31.360]   And two, that Twitter can use this, whether they do intentionally or not, but can use this
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.000]   to manipulate coverage, because as soon as Arrington does something they don't like,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.280]   bye-bye, you are no longer on the S.U.L., and your follower number is just plateau.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.280]   There you have it.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.920]   I'm against the word corruption.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.400]   That's-- Well, Dave Weiner did.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.400]   I don't know-- So I'm not on the user list anymore.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.240]   I got removed a while back.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.240]   Oh, really?
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.240]   Do you know why?
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:59.560]   They sent me an email and they're like, "Hey, we rotate through people that we think
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:03.640]   are interesting people for others to follow, and you've been on there for a while, and
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   we're going to yank you off."
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.080]   And they did it to a bunch of different people, and I was like, "So be it.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.720]   That's just what happens."
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:15.040]   They're trying to basically create a list that when you come to Twitter for the first time
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.160]   and you sign up, hopefully you'll be able to go through that list and find some people
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.320]   that you recognize and you might want to follow.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.840]   So now you're looking for the list of some--
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:23.840]   Let me just show you the graph--
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.160]   There's a junk and garbage on that list.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:30.040]   Let me just show you the graph of how it was when you were on the S.U.L., and what happened
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.800]   when you got off the S.U.L.?
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:36.040]   It's going up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.680]   and I can tell you-- In fact, Kevin, I can tell you the date that you got taken on the
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.840]   S.U.L. was August 20th.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:43.840]   And boom.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.320]   Yeah, totally.
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:48.760]   I mean, that's just the nature of the list.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:52.960]   I mean, it brings in so many people that are coming to sign up for new Twitter accounts.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.600]   So nobody's-- I mean, we don't know if it's misused or not.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.400]   It's just clear that it has a lot of power.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:02.440]   Well, you're also assuming any of those people are still online, that they actually read
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   the feed, have what percentage--
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:07.480]   Well, I do notice it's going down slowly.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.600]   And I presume that there's a certain amount of attrition because a lot of those S.U.L.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.680]   followers are, in fact, not committed Twitter users.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.120]   They got there because Oprah was there and they fall off.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.280]   But they wouldn't quit.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.280]   Kevin wouldn't lose.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.200]   Generally, wouldn't lose anybody unless they bumped them from this.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.760]   Well, you lose people a couple of different ways, I think.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.040]   One, they delete spammers from time to time, right?
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.480]   So some of those accounts are going to be spam and you're going to lose some people.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:37.920]   The others, people have no idea who you are and they'll be like, "I don't even remember
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.920]   signing up for you."
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:39.920]   Why am I following him?
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.920]   Because he's kind of automatic.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.400]   Yeah, and then the third thing is every time I tweet out, like, "Prob, rep, fire, stuff,"
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.240]   I get a lot of people on call on me.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.240]   That happens to me.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.240]   There's a reason for it.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.000]   I think everyone should bail out on you now.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   So here's my graph.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.800]   I'm the San Francisco area for God's sake.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.800]   Here's my graph.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.080]   And because I'm not on the S.U.L. it's very steady always.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:02.360]   You could see where they dropped some spammers because I took a couple of a thousand people
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360]   off there.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.880]   But it's a pretty predictable linear curve compared to what happens with the S.U.L.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:17.120]   I don't know what to make of that, but it does open up the potential for corruption because
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.160]   you could say, "Hey, I don't like your coverage, Mike Harrington.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.080]   I'm taking you off the S.U.L."
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.960]   But you guys are acting like that's going to actually so--
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:24.960]   It's valuable.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.760]   Don't say it's not valuable to say, "I have a million followers."
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.320]   It shows up in the New York Times.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:33.880]   Whenever an article is written about somebody that is one of the numbers, if they have a
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.880]   large number, that will come up--
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880]   This is actually--
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:39.640]   Having directly seen the results of some of the link-throughs with people with a million
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   followers--
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.640]   I understand.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.480]   It's you and I know it's worthless, but the mainstream media doesn't, and normal people
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.480]   are.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480]   But this is actually-- Sorry, Pat, go ahead.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:51.480]   I was going to say, I mean, it's like-- It's not like this is going to be quieting
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:55.280]   Harrington and maybe punishing Harrington from Twitter's viewing.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.800]   It is punishing Harrington.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   But it's not like it's silencing Harrington's voice.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   It's not like it's--
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.560]   It could have a chilling effect.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.760]   So everybody else is going to stop reading Harrington's articles and tech crunch.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:09.440]   If you're a journalist and you're thinking of saying something bad about Twitter and
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:13.080]   you are on the suggested user's list, you might think twice depending on what you see
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.080]   the value in your channel list.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.080]   Then you shouldn't be a journalist.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.080]   Well, I agree with you.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   That's absolutely right.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080]   You should sack up.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:20.080]   You should buy a pair of ovaries and get a clue.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.080]   Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.080]   You know what I mean?
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.080]   It's like--
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.080]   I'm about to win.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.080]   Free's got two million--
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.240]   I'm going to call it a quarter million followers and updates regularly.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:31.920]   I mean, the people that are there are probably legitimate fans.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:37.640]   This is actually part of the talk that I'm going to be giving at FOA next week.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:43.840]   But it's about features that are created on websites that stroke the ego and features
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.320]   that kind of tend to blow up a site.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:52.480]   And one of the big thing for Twitter was the follower count because celebrities basically
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.200]   get on Twitter.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:58.200]   They look at that count as a means of social currency, the more the better.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.200]   And they're basically Twitter has.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.720]   I don't even think they plan to do this.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.440]   But they've turned every celebrity into a spokesperson for them.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440]   Absolutely.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.160]   Millions and millions and millions of dollars of free.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.160]   I mean, I just saw--
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160]   Kevin, you and I did it.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.160]   It's been filler.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.720]   You and I had that horse race.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.720]   And that--
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.720]   Exactly.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.720]   I mean, that's what did it?
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.280]   Yeah, and it's happening.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.760]   I mean, look at what's happened with all these celebrities now.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:23.760]   They're creating videos.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.640]   They're going out there in the press.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.640]   They're on Oprah.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.640]   I mean, you name it.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.440]   Like, I've never seen this happen before, where celebrities will just go out there and freely
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.000]   promote and plug something.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   Really?
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   It's insane.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   It's brilliant.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   But they're excited about it.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.640]   And what's amazing about it is it's not somebody pretending to have a website they built when
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.960]   it's built by some little cadre of people from the agents office or something.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:50.820]   But this is actually like Shaq sitting in a bar somewhere or a restaurant or whatever
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:56.160]   Shaq tweets from or following Tony Hawk, man.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.360]   I think it's a hoot to follow Tony Hawk.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.960]   One of the other things, one of the other points real quick that I wanted to make is
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:09.000]   that one of the things I think is first is that I believe that in some ways spam actually
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.720]   helps Twitter because what it does is it increases follower accounts on a lot of these
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.320]   smaller accounts.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.840]   And it gives people a perception of audience, right?
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:21.200]   So someone will come in and say, oh, I have 50 people following me.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.000]   Maybe 25 of those accounts are fake, right?
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.400]   But they believe there's an audience there and so they engage with the product more.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.880]   It's just a really weird ecosystem.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.920]   Do you, are you going to talk in your talk about things like that that are brilliant hacks
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:41.440]   in effect, social engineering versus features that you add to a site that add genuine value
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.440]   to the site?
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.800]   I think that's the next step for Twitter.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.480]   I think that Twitter, it's not just going to be the raw number of followers, but it's
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.920]   going to be how influential that person is and looking at other factors in order to
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:54.920]   determine that.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.520]   And that's some of the stuff I'm playing around with on We Follow.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.640]   We have a bunch of people tagging themselves under certain keywords and we're starting
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.200]   to look at how many people inside of certain tags are being followed by other tastemakers
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.200]   inside of that tag.
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.960]   So if Shaq were to tweet something out about Nike, I would instantly know how many people
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.080]   that are fans of Nike are following Shaq and how important is that?
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.080]   It's fun times.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.460]   I liken it to all the media where you could, for instance, on a show like The Screen
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:27.320]   Saver's, you could boost ratings by having more low-cut tops on the girls or you could
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:30.560]   boost ratings by putting more content in.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.200]   It's two very different approaches.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:37.800]   One is kind of shallow and manipulative and one is kind of more genuine.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.000]   So there was a point where we had that balance though, right?
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   Don't do that.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.600]   There's a balance.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.600]   I don't know.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.600]   I'm one of those.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.520]   Look what we do on Twitch.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.000]   This is not exactly a sexy production.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.760]   We try to make it a value, right?
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:03.720]   Yeah, but there was a time in when The Screen Saver's and Love Marhayton, when Paul Block,
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.760]   our executive producer came on and threw Morgan Webb up there in a cute little Windows
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.080]   Air shirt and she was delivering awesome content.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.880]   She's an amazingly brilliant smart woman.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.880]   So you're saying she was very attractive.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880]   She was saying do both.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.880]   I mean, we worked for our fans, you know?
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.280]   Yeah, I guess that's true.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.680]   As long as you're not sliding the content, I guess.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:22.680]   Right.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:28.960]   I just, I am allergic to manipulation and I hate it when many of you are so not allergic
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.960]   to manipulation.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:33.440]   Maybe because I'm so susceptible to manipulation.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.440]   Yes.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.440]   You may despise and hate manipulation.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.440]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440]   I don't like it.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.280]   I don't because I'm a sucker for it.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.400]   Immune, Mune, quite suggested it has no impact on it.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.120]   I probably wouldn't hate it so much if I were immune to it.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.080]   So seeing as I'm not immune to it, it bugs me.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.920]   The chat room nuts with that one, Leo.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:55.520]   That is BS Leo says.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.760]   That I don't like manipulation?
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.520]   No, that you're immune to it.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.520]   No, that's what I said.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:02.520]   I am not.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.520]   I am not.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.640]   Patrick nailed me on that one.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.040]   I never pretended I was immune to it, but I am.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.320]   But it bugs me.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.240]   I always feel like you should try to give value.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.240]   I don't know.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.880]   I think it may be a more long term successful if you give value.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.360]   I remember when working at Tech TV, we all had these little TVs in our cube.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.360]   Remember that?
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.280]   So we could be sitting there and preparing for that day show, but yet they'd rerun the
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.080]   screen savers from the day before.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.840]   So we'd be sitting there and the screen savers would be running on.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.320]   And of course, you watch your own segments because you're like, okay, how did I look?
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.440]   Do I get the points across?
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.480]   And then Morgan would come up on the screen and do her Windows tip.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.320]   And I knew the Windows tip.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.560]   Yet I would still turn and watch more of my screen, right?
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.560]   Exactly.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.120]   Well, that's what I hate.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:47.160]   I don't like it that I can be manipulated like that.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.240]   Maybe that's it.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.600]   Real quickly, you don't watch Fox News, Leo.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.600]   I do.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.600]   I have it on right now.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.600]   And let me tell you something about Fox.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.600]   That's right.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.760]   You had it on last time I was there because on the weekends, Amazon.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:01.760]   Well, you know, it's funny that you should say that because I just know, I don't know.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.560]   I never noticed that before.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.560]   They have the cutest anchors.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.880]   It's all cute anchors.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.960]   They're all perky blonde cute anchors on there or in commentators.
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:10.960]   I never noticed that.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:11.960]   That's not true, Leo.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:12.960]   There's a few brunettes.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:13.960]   Okay.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:19.840]   But I don't know the reason is because I needed to have a news channel on an MSNBC does prison
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.840]   breakout all weekend long.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:26.920]   It's the most revolting pro talk about God awful programming and CNN is like, I don't
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.160]   know what they're doing there in rerun heaven.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.960]   Larry Larry King.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.320]   So I have to watch him a Fox because if something because God forbid something horrible should
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.040]   happen in the middle of a show, I want to know it.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.720]   I don't want to be in the dark.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.120]   I thought it was explaining why you were bouncing on that ball constantly.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.360]   That's just, that's just to keep me pumped.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.560]   I've hooked it up to my pump Nintendo slashes.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:57.480]   We price by $50 like they're not already number one MMS in your iPhone.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.480]   Exciting?
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.480]   Well, I'll come back.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:04.240]   Yeah, because the people can send, yeah, some of the images and movies where I won't
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:07.400]   have to like cut and paste a password on my Mac.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:10.840]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.480]   That's a good point.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.840]   Google book settlement on the rocks again, the Department of Justice weighed in and Google
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.520]   and the judge said, all right, back to the table, we got to figure it out better.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.600]   A better settlement.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.520]   So the hearing is put off.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:31.480]   Windows seven do earlier because a couple of companies might just push a PC out with
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.480]   Windows seven.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.280]   Well, they haven't changed the release date for Windows seven.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.280]   It's over 20 seconds.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:41.280]   There's kind of some hacks you can do to get access to Windows seven earlier on a new system.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:45.600]   Some small custom PC makers, according to Crave, are claiming they'll start shipping
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.480]   systems as early as October 13th with Windows seven on it.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.560]   Oh, I had something I want to talk about.
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.560]   Yes.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.080]   Very importantly, oh, I changed all of us.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.080]   Yes.
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:58.320]   I tweeted out last week a link to an old screensaver segment.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.320]   Yes.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.920]   G4 Media stepped in and took it down off of YouTube.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:02.920]   What?
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.920]   Yep.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:05.920]   Why would they do that?
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.920]   Because they own the rights to it.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:08.920]   And then we get traffic.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.240]   It concerns me though, because it's really good.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:15.160]   There's a lot of tutorials and how-tos that got snipped up and put up on YouTube and they
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.160]   exist out there.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.960]   And it worries me that they're taking down good quality content for no apparent reason
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.800]   at all.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.840]   It says remove from G4 Media after.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.840]   They're protected.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.440]   Wait, wait, it was G4's YouTube account?
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.440]   No, no.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.920]   They moved that down off of G4 Media.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.920]   Exactly.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:40.640]   There have been screensavers clips on YouTube for five years just sitting there.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.200]   But now they're starting to do DMCA takeout takedowns.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.160]   Well, some of the best moments of the show too, which is too bad.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.880]   What was the bit that you put up there?
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:54.240]   Mine was about hacking a toothbrush into making a Sonic Air toothbrush.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:57.680]   So I took like a $8 toothbrush and made it a really expensive one.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.520]   It was your segment.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.760]   Yeah, it was my segment.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.760]   You know what I bet it was?
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:10.680]   I bet you linking to it generated enough traffic that it raised awareness of G4 and they had
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:11.680]   it pulled.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.440]   All right, I have another possible.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:17.040]   Yeah, wait, can I throw in before you get the real answer, Leo?
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.040]   Yep.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:22.240]   It's because they were afraid that the numbers might go up and they didn't.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.120]   They were afraid they're getting more hits.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:31.120]   Kevin Rose, five-year-old toothbrush segment, then on current programming on G4, I think
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.720]   you're exactly right.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:34.720]   I think that's exactly right.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:35.880]   No, I doubt that.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:36.880]   I got it.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   Okay, this is my theory.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.880]   I got a call.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.560]   I think I've told you guys this.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:43.960]   Got a call from people at G4 about three months ago.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.600]   They said we have been over the past three years, convert.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.880]   We have every show ever done, high quality tapes or whatever, hard drives.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:51.880]   I don't know what.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.320]   I've every show ever done on tech TV from 1998.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.080]   I know you don't believe this, John.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:04.040]   From 1998 to 2004, we have for the last few years been digitizing every one of these.
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:08.480]   We would like to know if you're okay with it, if we put up a website that is tech TV
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.400]   retro that has everything you ever did on it.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.520]   I said, all right with it.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.440]   I would sing it to the heavens.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.320]   And sell DVDs with your face on the outside of it.
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:22.400]   And they can, they have the right to do that.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:28.680]   We all signed that paper that said, all media now or future forever.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:29.880]   I didn't sign that.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:30.880]   You didn't sign that?
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.320]   I didn't need a separate cover.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.600]   I've never signed away to the right image.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.440]   You didn't have a personal services contract?
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.920]   I never had a contract, Leo.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.960]   Oh, you were so smart.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.760]   Who's saying they're going to be repackaging and reselling these G4?
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.440]   No, they did not say to me that we were repackaging them.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:53.640]   They said they would be making a free website where people could go see high quality digitized
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.520]   copies of all the stuff we ever did.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.440]   Is this G4 or someone who?
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.840]   This was G4.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.200]   This was the people in the internet division there.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.560]   They said, hey, we're real big fans.
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.720]   We've always wanted to get this back on the air.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.720]   We have been kind of quietly digitizing everything.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.040]   Yeah, but I mean, this is going to cost them just tons of money and bandwidth charges.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.880]   And they're going to have to monetize it somehow, right?
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:17.880]   They have to make it.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.520]   They'll have to put pre rolls on and come on and tie it.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:22.480]   Of course, they're basically going to monetize it.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.680]   I don't mind that.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:27.560]   But OK, so if they are going to do that, I could see maybe why they'd start issuing takedowns
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.720]   on YouTube.
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:29.720]   Hmm.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:30.720]   Maybe.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.000]   I always think it's dumb to take down anything anywhere.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.720]   Just put it out there and it and it promotes you that you've got the high quality version
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.720]   back at the ranch.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:44.840]   I mean, or they could just upload them all to YouTube and call it a day, right?
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.840]   They don't have to go to the site.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.240]   Or if you're listening, what's that?
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.320]   What's the deal?
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.320]   I hope they're going to do this.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.320]   G4.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.720]   No, no, I'm not saying screw you.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.080]   I said, that's great.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.440]   I'd love to see you do that.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.440]   Please do that.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.680]   You would have no, you would have nothing, no issue for me because I don't unlike so
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:08.240]   obviously G4 media, I don't feel like those things should be kept back.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:09.480]   They should be out there.
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.480]   Don't you all don't you all agree?
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.480]   I agree.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:14.480]   You wouldn't have to.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.640]   Patrick, if all those great shows are.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.640]   I'd love to see it out there.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:21.400]   I just don't particularly want to see my image on the cover of a DVD without my permission.
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.400]   That's all.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.560]   I would love to see the video posted online.
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:24.560]   I love it.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.800]   It's a they did it anyway.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.640]   Remember, aren't there a bunch of DVDs with, you know, you show, you know, cut downs of
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.640]   you showing them to do different.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.000]   It's an easy lawsuit for Patrick.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.080]   Patrick, you actually do want to see your image on a D.E.
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.480]   That's easy half mill in your bank account, Pat.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:40.480]   That's cool.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.480]   All right.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.920]   Well, you guys, let's give you the name of a good lawyer.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.320]   Let's get this rolling.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:47.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.120]   It's always fun to get the old gang back together again.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.920]   Patrick Norton is on dig, uh, dignity nation.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.240]   Patrick Norton is on tech.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.800]   Zilla, HD nation, HD nations, the new show with Robert here and we asked Robert to come
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800]   with us.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.800]   I think he was unavailable.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.080]   I want to get Robert on to, but that's a great show.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.200]   And you must all watch it.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:12.560]   It's at revision three or just go to techzilla.com to EKZ, L L A. Thanks, Tom with beautiful.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.800]   I'm so jealous Veronica Belmont.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.800]   Smart too.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.760]   Well, smart number one, just the greatest, just really fantastic.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.960]   Kevin Rose is the dig guy.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:29.120]   And of course, dig nation is still the best, uh, the best and best traveled tech show on
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.280]   the network.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.640]   We do travel a lot.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:37.200]   And you, uh, so, so when's the next on the road for, for a dig nation?
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.800]   I don't know when the next one is.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:47.080]   Uh, you're up in a limousine and they take you to the airport and you arrive and you say,
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.080]   where are we?
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.080]   Okay.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.080]   Hello, Cleveland.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.080]   That would be awesome.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.640]   That is not the case.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:59.680]   Our best, the best thing we ever did, Patrick St. Louis or that was epic or Tom's River,
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:00.680]   New Jersey.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:01.680]   That was pretty good too.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:03.360]   A Tom's River, New Jersey was fun.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:08.200]   It's very close to my folks hometown or my hometown, but St. Louis, all those people
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:12.080]   out in 13 degree weather, that was just incredible.
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:16.400]   We kept signing until they came and they took the tent that was over us away.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:17.400]   They took the stage.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.400]   You're sitting on a way.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.400]   They took the table.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.800]   We were, and we continued to sign.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.560]   It was just us and two chairs in the parking lot till every single person had an autograph.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:27.560]   And that was it.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.800]   That was the peak of my career.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.760]   John, John, see, I could be a part of it.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:33.760]   John C.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.760]   Devorek is a channel.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.760]   Devorek.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.080]   And someday, he will peak, but not yet.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.240]   I will be what?
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.240]   I don't know.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.400]   The peak of your career has not happened yet.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.360]   Am I wrong?
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.360]   Is it all downhill?
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.560]   I think you have up on you.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.560]   That's true.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:56.560]   Thank you.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.560]   You've had old cell phone.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:58.560]   I think.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.560]   There we go.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.560]   Yep.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.560]   You're going to get it.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.560]   You're going to get it.

[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.560]   You're going to get it.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.560]   You're going to get it.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.560]   Okay.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:10.200]   You can watch this do this thing live.
