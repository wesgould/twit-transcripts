[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.640]   The show we cover the week's tech news we have assembled.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.520]   An esteemed distinguished panel of technology experts to facilitate this conversation.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:03:08.460]   This week we start with Denise Howell, former host of this week in law.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.360]   They've had my power out twice in the last two weeks.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.260]   You're not far off.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.820]   You really realize how much we depend on power when you lose it.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.540]   And they went ahead and broke the fiber optic that was providing internet to the house at
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.540]   the same time.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.380]   That's awesome.
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.980]   Also with us from the great state of Hawaii where it is still yesterday.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.980]   Doc, no, it's not Doc Rock.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.980]   Oh my God.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.980]   You too.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.980]   Come on.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.980]   Slash Doc Rock.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.780]   He's also an E cam ambassador and he is according to the sign behind his head on the air.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.780]   Welcome.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.780]   Yes.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.140]   Thank you so much.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.540]   I like the purpleness of the grotto with Doc.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.540]   The Doc.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.820]   I started this as an homage for Alzheimer's awareness.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.700]   That's the color for Alzheimer's awareness.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.780]   Karen's dad, sorry, has an "and my mom."
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.060]   We've got it about at the same time.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.620]   I've just been on a mission.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.460]   Can we do something about this thing?
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.460]   Good.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.460]   I'm with you.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.460]   That started it and I like it.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.820]   I'm getting to the age where if I start forgetting your name then you'll know I'm next.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.500]   So let's grab and visit it.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.020]   We come out walking the room and like, "Why am I in here?"
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.980]   I'm like, "Oh God, no, me too."
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.660]   You know why that is, by the way?
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.660]   Why?
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.580]   When you go through a door, it's a context shift.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.580]   Yes.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.580]   Right?
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.580]   Then he's backed me up on this.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.580]   100%.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.580]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.580]   And for some reason--
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.580]   Like the door in severance and then just going to elevator and--
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.580]   It's like the elevator in severance.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.620]   No, for some reason when you shift a context like that, your brain is designed to like
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.540]   scram to dump the old ram and start fresh.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.940]   So everything you thought about before you went through that door, gone.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.940]   It's not made up.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.260]   I knew this onboard memory thing was a thing.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.100]   I got to talk to Tim about that.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.580]   It's not made up, right?
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.420]   Denise Howell backs me up.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.420]   Also here for the Tech meme, "Ride Home" podcast, Internet historian Brian McCullough.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.420]   Good to see you.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.660]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.100]   I've got something that you should buy.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.180]   It's not-- it wasn't Prime Day.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.980]   But see if you can recognize who this is.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.980]   Hold on.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.580]   With the red nose.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.420]   Well, it's got a band-aid on because my dog bit the nose off.
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.420]   Ow!
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.620]   Who is that?
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.620]   It is.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.620]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.620]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.620]   Oh, it's Zuckerberg.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.620]   Now, here's what I'm--
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.340]   No wonder your dog bit his nose.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.300]   This is legitimately what he's been used for.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.300]   You ready?
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.060]   He's got a Mark Zuckerberg head.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.060]   Where do you put your headphones when you're done with a show?
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.780]   Are you just throwing them on a desk?
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.700]   Do you get that and how much?
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.700]   It's on Etsy.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.020]   It was 50 bucks.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.020]   It's a 3D printed Zuckerberg head.
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.140]   And since he loves all things Roman emperors and stuff, I figure that the nose kind of
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.140]   works.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.140]   It does.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.300]   You should just chop it right off.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.300]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.300]   That is great.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.300]   Wow.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.260]   I think you should get that.
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.060]   I think you should get that for the studio because remember, was it Conan who always used
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.420]   to have the pencil cup that was Eisenhower or something?
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.020]   Now, by the way, there are other-- I don't have to copy you.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.020]   I could get--
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.020]   Arnold.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.980]   They have an Arnold head for holding your headphones.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.300]   Take your-- get your ass to Mars.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.300]   That's good.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.300]   I might--
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:43.900]   Actually represented Arnold in a case where he was suing about an auto dealership misusing
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.340]   his likeness.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.780]   And this is a similar kind of situation.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.620]   Similar, please do not contact angled designers.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.940]   Here's Jack Nicholson as the Joker.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.100]   Oh, that is brilliant.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.100]   Sure, buddy.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.100]   Put those headphones on me.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.140]   I think this is a real discovery here.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.020]   Angled designers on Etsy.
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.220]   They have a home lander, Steve Carell.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.220]   Godzilla.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.220]   Oh, Mark.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.220]   You want Mark Hamill?
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.060]   Well, my whole office is Star Wars everything.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.740]   Wouldn't it be funny if the headphones were on-- I think you need to get this.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.060]   Why is Arnold $4 more?
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.500]   Yeah, I was wondering about the price difference.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.860]   For some reason.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.860]   And--
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.860]   And a gubernatorial fees.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.500]   Maybe because he's so big, it uses more PLA fiber.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.940]   It's very expensive to print the-- the muscles.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.400]   That's his-- I can't decide.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.500]   That's really what's-- but here's--
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   That's creepy.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.500]   It's very realistic.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   It is.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.160]   It's good to know that 3,656 people in the world have Arnold Schwerning shirts and
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.060]   fingers head on a shelf.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.540]   All right, well, we've started the show in a unique fashion.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.540]   Thanks to you, Brian.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.540]   I love that.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.900]   It would have-- it was only a matter of time before I asked.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.220]   Is that Mark Zuckerberg's head on your shelf?
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.220]   So it's a good thing.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.220]   He'll be watching over us the whole--
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.540]   I'm a little mad at Mark.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.540]   And I don't know.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:14.740]   Maybe this is-- it's not reasonable to be mad at Mark for this.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.580]   It just says something leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:25.680]   A teenager and her mom in Nebraska, a 17-year-old girl, and her mom chatting on Facebook Messenger,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:32.920]   they thought privately about her medicine-induced abortion.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.240]   The abortion was at 28 weeks, which is illegal in Nebraska.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.360]   Nebraska somehow must have found out about it.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.840]   The police sent a subpoena warrant to-- I don't know what the difference is.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.160]   One of those, I think, a warrant to Facebook.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.920]   And they provided the not-so-private chats, which are then used together more evidence
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.240]   and arrest the 17-year-old who's being tried as an adult.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.760]   Her mother is also being tried, as is a man who is charged with attempting to conceal the
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.880]   death of another person, the fetus.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.920]   This to me is exactly-- in a nutshell, why privacy is so important.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.240]   Denise, can you fall Facebook?
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.880]   Don't they have to give the police that information given a valid one?
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   They do.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.480]   Here's what they don't have to do.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.360]   They don't have to have the data.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   They could delete it.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.960]   They don't have to keep chat lots and lots.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960]   Good point.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   So if you want to get mad at Mark for something, get mad about him for that.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.440]   Because they have to respond to search warrants with information they actually have.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.320]   If they don't have it, they don't have anything to give over.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.480]   This is why encryption and encryption is so important because then a company can't hand
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   it over.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.000]   And in fact, weirdly, right about the same time, mad at expanded messengers and encryption,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.840]   they say it is unrelated to the Nebraska abortion case.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.760]   You can have end-to-end encrypted conversations as I remember on messenger, but you have to
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.160]   turn it on.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.560]   And you remember that famous post from Mark Zuckerberg three years ago saying, "We're
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.360]   going to-- everything's going to be end-to-end encrypted eventually."
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.960]   They have faced, according to Wired, technical and political challenges that have delayed
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.240]   that.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.520]   But they're driving, according to Wired again, they're driving toward, quote, "a global
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.240]   rollout of default end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls next year."
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.760]   Government don't like this.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.480]   Government calls it going dark.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.080]   They think the bad guys are going to use this.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.080]   Government likes search warrants, for sure.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.800]   Yeah, we know that.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   So this is painful on a number of levels.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.560]   I feel for the 17-year-old who didn't want to have a baby.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.480]   She and her mom had conversations she thought was private.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.160]   Mark thought all otherwise.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.520]   But at every step of the way, this is all legal.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.800]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:27.040]   And a good cautionary tale in the wake of recent Supreme Court developments to know that
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.560]   this is how things are going to go.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.640]   This case would have been prosecuted before Dobbs because she was so--
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.360]   It was late, late term before.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.800]   But this is how this is going to go.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.160]   People are going to be asked for search histories.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.760]   People are going to be asked for communications.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:55.960]   And we know that the data smog that you leave behind you can be used in all sorts of ways.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.320]   I remember a story from years ago, was it Target?
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.920]   Some store knew that a shopper was pregnant before a family did based on her purchases
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   at the store.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.800]   So they started sending her solicitations for diapers and things.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.680]   And she was upset because she hadn't told anybody she was pregnant.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.040]   And this is the case.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.240]   Your data can say things.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.480]   And if suddenly you're not pregnant after being pregnant, this data can get you in a
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.480]   lot of trouble in about 23 states in the United States.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.360]   So what should we do?
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.240]   We talked about period tracking apps.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.200]   Turn those off, yes.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.640]   Definitely.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.720]   And I think it's just a good idea.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.640]   I know it's a lot to think about people using signal in their daily lives.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   But--
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   That's a shame.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.920]   Because then you're acting as if I'm a secret agent and I have to do everything encrypted.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.400]   Unless you have to get everybody to do it.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   And I even think that that could be a red flag for law enforcement.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.080]   Leo seems to be using encrypted messaging exclusively.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.080]   I wonder what he's up to.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.160]   Yeah, but you use HTTPS too in your browsers.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   You know?
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   I mean--
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   That's why Facebook and everybody else should just turn it on.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.800]   Then nobody looks guilty because they're using it.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.640]   It's just the default.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.640]   Everybody's using it.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.400]   You don't have to choose signal.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.720]   Well, that's what they move along.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.520]   The other reason that they want to do that is because exactly what we're talking about.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.720]   Then the next time something like this happens, they're kind of off the hook because there's
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.480]   nothing they can do.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.240]   The problem would be right to play devil's advocate is the next time there's a terrorist
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.520]   attack or something that everyone can see was planned on Telegram or something like that.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.880]   And there's no way to track people down.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.000]   Then the government gets even more mad.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.400]   The only thing I would say to that is there have always been and probably always will be
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.520]   a way for people to communicate privately.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.160]   Even if it involves going out in a field and whispering in each other's ear, people are
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.280]   going to be able to communicate privately.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.240]   You cannot eliminate all means of communicating privately.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:16.280]   And the law protects to some degree your privacy and things like, "Well, is there any--"
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.360]   Actually, it's a good one for our attorney.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.440]   Is there any-- I mean, you can get a-- law can always get a wiretap, right?
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.800]   They can open mail, right?
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   They're laws against opening mail.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.960]   But if they have a warrant, they can open mail.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.920]   And particularly under the Patriot Act and all the legislation that came out after 9/11,
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:42.440]   yeah, you can-- if there is probable cause for a crime that's being investigated and
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:48.960]   they think that data may exist in a place, they can compel it to be turned over under
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.960]   a court order.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   So--
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   So--
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.400]   So we get back to do you have the data?
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   Right.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.000]   I'll make the argument that Phil Zimmerman made when I interviewed him.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.960]   He was the creator of PGP.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.640]   And he said law enforcement is not going dark.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:13.240]   Law enforcement has unprecedented access to data more than they've ever had before.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.480]   People are using digital devices to communicate and law enforcement can see into most of those.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:25.080]   So it isn't the fact that, oh my God, we can't do our job anymore.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.400]   He said, and I think he's accurate, it's more of a case.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.840]   They've got an amazing view into everything that's going on.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.600]   And there are a few little spots where they can't see and that bugs them that there's
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   some dead pixels.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.120]   They're not going dark.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.920]   They have more than they've ever had before.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.240]   Does that seem accurate, Doc Rock?
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.240]   100%.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.400]   That's exactly what I think that it is the-- they want full control.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.120]   And they also want full autonomy.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.040]   And it's funny how it works until it gets flipped back on them because of something that
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   they did wrong.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.280]   Then it's like, oh, the camera was off.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.800]   Or this is secret.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.720]   And if we tell you how we did it, then, you know, so that's the catch 22.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   And you're right.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.800]   They definitely have more access.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.680]   They have the best tools in the world.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:21.080]   Now, if you look on LinkedIn and you are a forensic data specialist, you will find jobs
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.560]   in law enforcement agencies all around the country looking to hire people that are even
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.640]   better at it.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.200]   So yeah, they're kind of full of-- they want the best tools for both worlds.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.320]   They also-- just like in an interrogation, they know all they need to know, but they
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.600]   want you to tell them because then that iron clads the case, which is the reason why they
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.840]   end up screwing it up because they keep pushing for confession and then they do something
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.120]   dumb and get the person off because they just want to get their work done for them.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120]   This is a little off topic.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   And by the way, we have a lot of law enforcement people listen to our shows.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   I've met them.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.240]   I've talked to them and I have a huge respect for them.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.240]   I don't know.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   My brother-in-law is a cop.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.120]   So I mean, it's definitely not an anti-law enforcement thing.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:08.760]   I think it's more of-- like you said, if I can get everybody to do all of the work for
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.240]   me, that just makes my job easier.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.320]   I don't blame anybody for wanting that, but you just got to understand what you're asking
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.320]   for.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.280]   And look, the Constitution has two amendments, the fourth and the fifth, the design really
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.760]   to protect our privacy and to protect us against unlawful search and seizure and overreaching
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   law enforcement.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.320]   So this is something that's been recognized for 200 plus years in this country.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.880]   And we are in theory protected.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.080]   I don't want to go down this-- there's a wonderful book.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.480]   Jeff Jarvis recommended Elie Mistal, who is a commentator at MSNBC.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.120]   He's a Harvard law graduate.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:51.440]   A brilliant guy wrote a book, "Allow Me to Retort the Black Man's Guide to the Constitution."
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.680]   And in it, he makes it-- I think a strong case that, look, we got the fifth of the menu.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.000]   You're right to not incriminate yourself.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.960]   People plead the fifth.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:11.000]   And yet, we allow it coerced confessions all the time.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.280]   And really, he says, you should not allow confessions in the trial.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   That just shouldn't be allowed.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.720]   The fifth specifically says, you have a right not to incriminate yourself.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.040]   And I mean, that's a longer conversation, and I'm sure Denise, you've probably thought
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   about this a little bit.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.560]   I think Elie makes a very-- or, Elie makes a very good case for it.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.160]   He's against confessions.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:41.880]   He says, forget Miranda writes, police should not be allowed to ask for confessions.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   You shouldn't.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.880]   I don't know.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.600]   I mean, if you're sitting there being interviewed and you're lawyers there and you have a good
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.160]   lawyer and you decide to confess, I'm okay with that confession being used.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.960]   It just is so often misused.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.960]   You're right.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.920]   Under perfect circumstances, I guess.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.000]   You should be allowed to plead guilty, right?
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   I did it.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.120]   Your honor, I did it.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.920]   Anything more than that, though, gets you in a lot of trouble because there's a lot of
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.240]   coerced confessions going on.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.240]   They lie to you.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.840]   They'll-- you know, there's all sorts of things.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.480]   So as any lawyer and any police officer will tell you, don't talk to the police, ever.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.440]   Just don't talk.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.840]   It's not in your interest.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.880]   They're not looking to help you.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.400]   They're looking to convict you.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.040]   Speaking of privacy, Lena Kahn, we've been waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.480]   She is the new chairman of the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, and they have now kicked
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:40.320]   off their massive push to regulate the data economy.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.240]   They've asked for a request for comments.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.960]   They launched a notice on Thursday this week of potential rulemaking and they're looking
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:57.960]   for comments on a long list of questions having to do with privacy and data protection.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.640]   And Kahn said in this statement, "The growing digitization of our economy," that's what
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.000]   we've just been talking about, right, "coupled with business models that can incentivize
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.280]   endless hoovering up of sensitive user data and a vast expansion of how that data is used
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.480]   means that potentially unlawful practices may be prevalent.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.400]   They're trying to decide whether they should regulate in these areas."
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:30.480]   It's a 44 page notice with literally dozens of questions about digital ads, security of
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.040]   consumer information, biometrics, psychological harms, corporate structure, the protection
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.200]   of kids and teens, algorithmic discrimination.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:45.160]   I haven't looked at all 44 questions, but I hope they have something in there about the
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.400]   perceived privacy of digital communications tools.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.440]   Well, that's right what we were talking about, isn't it?
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:02.880]   If it's the FTC, then wouldn't this be more about the commercial surveillance stuff than
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.720]   government surveillance stuff?
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.360]   So we were right before the show was starting, we were talking about Amazon Prime Day and
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.120]   whether Leo was going to get a rice cooker at the appropriate price.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.360]   The thing I was thinking about at that time is there are these tools out there.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.520]   I'll use the word tools to be generous and kind about what they are.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.560]   They are apps that help you price compare things.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.920]   So if you want a particular rice cooker, you can plug it in.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.520]   Camel, camel, camel.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.440]   They will scour the web.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.840]   And they will tell you when it's hit that price threshold that you've said or when it's
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.000]   gone on sale or however, they all work differently.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.680]   But I haven't delved too deeply into the data that these things are gathering and how they're
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   using it, but everyone is voluntarily forking over a lot of data here, not so much critical
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:11.080]   data about, am I going to have an illegal abortion or do something else illegal?
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.520]   But still, I don't think the people using these apps are thinking about the privacy
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.480]   ramifications of them.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.680]   By the way, I have this conversation with Lisa because she uses honey.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.560]   And every time I say, oh, don't use honey, she shows me the check that she gets in the
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.160]   mail from honey from Rakuten.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.080]   She says, no, no, Rakuten.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.800]   But this is the difference.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.840]   She's getting recompensed for the privacy violation.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:42.120]   She knows she's giving them this information and she's getting a check in the mail.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.400]   It's not exactly an explicit trade, but she understands.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.760]   And I think most people understand.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.440]   Yeah, that's why they're sending me money.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.720]   That's why I'm getting coupons.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.000]   They're doing something with the information I give them.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.920]   And I'm willing to do that for the check.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.200]   Well, I'm happy to have the FTC look into things like that and decide that everyone is
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.000]   on the same page about them.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.880]   Maybe it would be simple enough to say more disclosure.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.520]   Like, OK, you'd be very clear what you're going to do with this data and who's going
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.520]   to get it.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.000]   Don't just put it in some privacy statement in the fine print.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.200]   Tell people right up front, hey, we're going to send you $17.53 every four weeks.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.320]   In return, you're going to send us every bit of information about everything you do on
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.480]   the internet.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.320]   Because honey is a plug-in.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.520]   It sits in your browser and I guarantee you sees every site you're going to.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.800]   It's not just about shopping.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.840]   This is also the important point, too, though, is to set up guardrails.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.800]   Everything we've talked about is what exists right now.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.760]   But if we can set up guardrails, then when everybody is in connected cars and self-driving
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.440]   cars and your car-- I think, who is it?
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.880]   IEEE Spectrum has been doing a series all this week about the data that Tesla already
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   collects.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.040]   Oh, man, do they collect data.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:03.000]   So the idea is this isn't fixing stuff after the horses have already left the barn.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.800]   This is learning from not setting guardrails 20 years ago and setting guardrails to fix
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.760]   what already exists, but also to-- before a company can even form to exploit a certain
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.400]   thing, be like, well, you can't do that because it's against the rules.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   But they--
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.600]   Let's get in getting in front of it.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   I mean, we worship capitalism.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:32.080]   And this isn't exactly what capitalism is all about is using these technologies to be
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.720]   more successful as a company.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   That's--
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   100%.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.840]   There were people out there who bought the people's PC and were happy to have it.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.840]   Do you remember that thing?
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.560]   And I am all for their ability to buy the people PC or whatever its modern day equivalent
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:25:00.000]   is and be the data, a combinatorian, a coal mine, I guess, giving over your activities
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.080]   and being subjected to ads.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   People.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.880]   But it's got-- there has to be a real decision to do that.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.160]   There has to be Lisa deciding, yeah, I want my check.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.520]   People PC online unlimited data access.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.680]   This was from EarthLink.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.080]   Unlimited internet access for free.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.080]   For free.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.520]   Or, OK, $5 a month.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.480]   Five times faster with a free accelerator.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.120]   You can't get this anymore, by the way.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.840]   This comes up every time I have a conversation with someone and trying to explain to them
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:37.480]   that know your-- let's call her Angela, Angela and Serena are not listening to you.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.520]   They're like, no, but they are because every time I do something, I'm like, do you just--
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.120]   have you ever had a Olympus or Roland, the little recorder from college where you used
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.120]   to try to take notes?
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.920]   Imagine doing that for, I don't know, 8 billion people and processing that.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.480]   You can't listen to all that.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.680]   You know, speech to text.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.880]   And I'm like, no, you're giving this info up every single day.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.200]   And my friends are like, no, no.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.480]   I'm like, do you have honey or rocketate installed in your browser?
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   And I'm like, yeah.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.280]   I'm like, you're giving all the answers everywhere you search, just with those two things.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.720]   And I use rocketate because I like to check too, but I also have ghostery to block the
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.040]   stuff that I know that's bad.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   You're just a free writer on Rakuten.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.720]   That's what you are, my friend.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.960]   Don't tell anybody.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.360]   And I wish they would stop.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.360]   You know, this is my only pet pee with Rakuten.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.360]   It's Rakuten.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:35.960]   Rakuten started out as a-- but they in the US completely changed it to Rakuten because
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.920]   they like, it'll be easier for Americans to understand.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.800]   You're not dumb if you used the right answer.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.720]   Yeah, that may be what they say, but what they really want is, it's not foreign.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.200]   We know what Americans think it's a foreign.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.080]   You know, I didn't think about that.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   That's why they adjusted.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.080]   It's America.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   It makes sense.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.280]   It's a completely missing.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.680]   By the way, okay.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.720]   So I was looking at a rice cooker, busted.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.040]   What are the chances that Amazon is now recommending rice cookers to me?
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   Should we check?
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   Should we just-- oh, look.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   Oh.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   Oh.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040]   Yes.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   Rice cookers galore.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.560]   Look, they even showed you some ou-moo-ghee over there, which is actually good stuff.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.360]   It's the green-- oh, yeah.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.600]   We buy a lot of this stuff.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.080]   This is the matcha green tea with brown-- roasted brown rice.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.800]   Well, and the guide to competitive programming was up there at the top two.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.200]   Well, that was something I was looking at.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.800]   How did you-- you picked right up on that, did you?
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   It's competitive for me.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.160]   Anything is, are they going to assume you're Japanese and start pitching you a bunch of
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.040]   stereotypically Japanese products at this point?
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.280]   I think one reason-- I get it all the time.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:51.120]   And I think it's because when you check my browser, it has-- or if they can-- and I
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.120]   didn't even bother to check.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.560]   If they can see all the way down to the OS, I have Japanese installed because I rate
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.560]   in Japanese office.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.040]   I'm doing that with your hand stock.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.760]   And yeah, you're right because I definitely get recommended things that I'm like, they
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.200]   don't send this to anybody else.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.400]   But I definitely get like, you know, miso products and things like that.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   They know.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   Presented to.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.480]   Although I think that really these recommendation engines are so crappy is part of the reason
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.400]   people don't like the ad tracking.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.280]   If they were good, it wouldn't be so bad.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.720]   But you're recommending stuff you just bought.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.160]   They're recommending things you would never want.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.880]   There's so bad.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.680]   So here's what-- explore more items.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.560]   This is just a random collection of weird stuff.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.880]   You have the same-- because I bought a Jackery like three months ago.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.600]   And so you have the exact same stuff on-- because I got those solar panels all the time.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.680]   I have every battery thing you can.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.840]   I've never ever purchased solar panels.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:54.640]   But that's the point is that-- so I spent $1,500 on a whole unit, like, you know, solar
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.240]   panels, this battery thing or whatever.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.920]   I don't need another one necessarily.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   Yeah, you just bought it.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   It's not stopped.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.000]   You need it as badly as I need the Trump-o-King stainless vertical skewer barber crow grill
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.440]   stand great for tacos al pastor's shawarma, Brazilian chorisca, whole chicken, kebabs,
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   and many other delicious dishes that require skewers.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.360]   Hey, I'm coming over if you buy that thing.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   With dyes.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.280]   You don't think I'll be making shawarma any time soon.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.000]   This is the part that's creepy that freaks people out.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   People don't understand this.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.800]   And it's changed a little bit because we haven't been as mobile as before.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.240]   But if you frequent the same four or five people all the time, because you guys just
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.280]   hang out, bridge night, poker, whatever, and one of the people in your group starts searching
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.320]   for stuff, the recommendation engines would assume that all of you guys might, because
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.760]   I had buddies looking at Disneyland trips and I would get the Disney ads on my YouTube
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.760]   stuff.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.760]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.560]   And the funny one, they'll send me Disney owl-leaving ads.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.760]   And I'm like, bro, I live here.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.920]   I could just drive people out of the sea.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.400]   You know, we got to see-- I want to see Stitch.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   I'll walk over there.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.400]   It's--
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   It's really--
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.000]   Because other people look, it's into you.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.720]   It's just really how pathetic the whole recommendation thing is.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.240]   It just doesn't work well.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.080]   And so, you know, I think a lot of times-- and there's another story related to this,
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:17.920]   but a lot of times tech companies blame us for, oh, you know, you're doing ad blockers
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.720]   or using ghostry or, you know, they blame us for their crappy technology.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.680]   The recommendation engines, even if you use Rakuten and Honey and you give them all the
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   information, they still get it.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.520]   I just bought a rice cooker.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.880]   They want to sell me more.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.800]   Like how many rice cookers does one family need?
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.160]   And just so you know the guide to competitive programming, Brian?
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   Yes.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.720]   There is such a thing as competitive programming.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.880]   Perhaps you're not familiar with it, but it's a lot of fun.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.360]   Competitions for how fast you can solve programming problems.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:56.760]   Are you aware that the Excel championships were on ESPN?
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760]   ESPN too.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.760]   El Ocho, they were on.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.760]   The Ocho.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:06.520]   You know, Leo, you just showed me something funny because of course in my live stream
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.240]   process, people ask me gear recommendations.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.840]   So I'm always going to Amazon to show them which one.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.480]   I wish they had a way to close that pick that way you left off and keep shopping for, because
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.960]   recently I was doing the stream and I'm about to go on this 42 day road trip.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.160]   So naturally that required buying some skibbies.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.160]   And I went up with the most recent stream.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.520]   I was like, "Yo, champion, like six Excel draws you fast."
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.160]   Thanks for putting me on blast, Alexis.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.280]   I'm telling you, that's why people hate this stuff.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.680]   If they were better at it, I think people wouldn't mind so much, but they're not good
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.120]   at it.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:49.520]   I do a every year at the end of the year in December, there's something called the advent
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   of code.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.720]   It's an advent of calendar of coding problems.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.280]   And I do it every year and I always get stuck before the end.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.680]   And so I'm hoping if I read a few books, I'll be ready for competitive programming.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.680]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   And we'll see you on El Ocho.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   El Ocho.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.360]   ESPN introduces the World Excel Championships.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.160]   It's actually the financial modeling world cup.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.640]   Let's be very specific here.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.080]   And I'm told it was quite good.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   I don't know.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   Did you watch it?
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.080]   No.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.000]   And that is, it was always amusing to me that, you know, Marty Python with their jokes about
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.920]   chartered accountants and stuff.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:35.720]   The idea that you could have exciting accounting e-sports is, I guess, a brave new world.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.160]   A hundred percent.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.440]   And I believe that's the channel where I first saw competitive professional cornhole.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.800]   I've, yes.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   I saw that too.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.040]   And I thought, why?
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   Why?
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.840]   But you know what?
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.400]   Then the guy made an amazing shot.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.440]   I thought, oh, I'm watching this some more.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   This is good.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.000]   Someone just invented a cornhole where the hole moves around.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.400]   I just bad not bad.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.000]   I just saw that recently.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Don't do that.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.480]   The hole was moving.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.560]   And so that way when you go to throw it, you can't, you can't just, you know, get good
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.440]   at your little arc or whatever you do.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.480]   By the way, these are the champions in the Excel e-sports all-star battle.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.560]   They kind of look like it, don't they?
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.560]   Not all of them.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.600]   I mean, some of them look pretty, you know, like you could go have a beer.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.760]   He's got to be, how big is this guy's forehead?
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   Look at this forehead.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.760]   My God.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.640]   That's eight hay.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.800]   What do you think the trash talk is if you're doing competitive Excel?
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:42.200]   Dude, it's probably not like boxers squaring off ahead of a, that's not a pivot table.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   That's typing.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:49.520]   Actually, this has been a big thing in the big, the open.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.640]   If you're, if you're good at this, the open is coming up in October.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   That means it's open to all.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.240]   You don't have to be, you know, a qualified competitor competitor.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   And there's a big $10,000 prize fund.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.160]   They're going to live stream it.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.600]   The ESPN took the live stream, edited it down to 30 minutes out of, you know, five hours
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.640]   and, and had a highlight.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.840]   Never thought I'd be on ESPN.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.840]   Jason Moore.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.640]   How about, let's see, which one would you like?
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.680]   It's a snake.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.520]   Can you write the snake game in Excel?
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.000]   Oh, cool.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.360]   You know, I mean, connect for what's lumberjack?
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.200]   What's lumberjack?
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.160]   No specific financial knowledge is required.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.640]   Well, that's a relief.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.640]   You have 30 minutes.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.480]   You'll get an Excel file that includes the case as well as a separate sheet with
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   correct answers.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.880]   Take note, there are many approaches to solving the case.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.240]   So it has something to do with tree harvesting.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.440]   I think this is great.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   This is competitive programming.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.440]   It is great.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:35:01.760]   I live down the street from UC Irvine, which has one of the most, I think, expansive e-sports
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:07.760]   undergraduate and possibly graduate programs of any university.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   And they have a whole e-sports arena.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.560]   They have, it's looking at me.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.560]   You have a, okay.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.200]   Now your son's going off to college in September.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.200]   Right.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   Right.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.840]   I think that they do this because kids in high school say, "Oh, I want to go to that
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.160]   school because I could study e-sports."
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.760]   And their parents are going over my dead body.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.480]   You're going to study e-sports.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.000]   Would you let your son become an e-sports legend?
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.760]   So one of my good friends, one of my sons, good friends, it was sort of going down that
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.760]   path.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.680]   I don't know that e-sports will be his life, but his parents did support him.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.440]   And, you know, I mean, there's money to be made there, guys.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.680]   It's not just a joke.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:56.800]   My 27 year old son is a TikTok chef and I have supported him in building his career as a
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   TikTok chef.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   Right.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   So you're right.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.680]   So if you'd come to me on his way to college saying, "Dad, I'm going to school to study
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   TikTok."
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.880]   I might have had some qualms about all this.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   See you, buddy.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.840]   He's got, I hate to say it, but he's got more followers than Twit does.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.760]   So I can't complain.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.520]   He's doing all right, I guess.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.960]   Although he keeps asking me for money.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   Is that normal?
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.160]   You'll flip that in a couple of years.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.360]   That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.960]   I'm saying I'm keeping track.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.040]   You know, in a couple of years I may be calling you.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   Let's take a little break.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.040]   I love this panel.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.600]   It's great to have you, Brian McCullough, the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.920]   A daily, daily show, but you do sometimes seven days a week.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.080]   We did seven this week.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.080]   Yes.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   Wow.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.880]   It just depends on what interviews we get, bonus episodes and things like that.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.880]   It's awesome.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.000]   And it's doing well and you're, you're, you love being a podcaster.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.880]   As I told you last time there's a venture fund now that all the LPs are listeners of
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.880]   the show.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   Awesome.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.920]   And so that has become a whole, a whole second.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.080]   That's why we have more bonus episodes now because we, we bring the companies on to tell
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   us what they're doing.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:19.000]   Imagine if I had told my dad when I went off to college, dad, I'm going to be a podcaster.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.440]   I don't, actually if I told him dad, I'm going to work in radio, he would have mocked
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.440]   me.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.800]   He would have said none under, under no circumstances.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:31.040]   Well, or, or I tell my parents that I'm going to run a venture capital fund.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.040]   How did you do that?
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.320]   You went to get an MBA at no, no, no, I started a podcast.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.320]   It's magic.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.480]   It's the magic dust that we sprinkle on everything we do.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:47.440]   Also from the wonderful E cam and, and his YouTube channel Doc rock in the house, YouTube
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.960]   dot com slash Doc rock.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.760]   Always good to see you my friend D O C R O C K in the USA.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.760]   Thank you, sir.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.880]   You know, it's, it's funny.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.520]   We just started a brand new podcast.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:04.400]   My marketing director Katie and I, and it's called the flow and we're talking about doing
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.080]   podcasts from a video first perspective.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:12.320]   We have dropped your name so many time in the first two episodes because I was, I was
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.840]   the idiot who did that.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:21.200]   And people did don't still don't understand how video first is a, is a incredible play
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.840]   because I still can chop all the audio pieces, but now we're in this social media thing
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:31.720]   with short form video, taking little chunks and making them into real shorts and TikToks
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.520]   without shipping is one of the best ways to get your marketing.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.520]   You bet.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.920]   So as a, as I'm here to say thank you for pioneering it.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   And it's funny.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.160]   Cause I'm, I'm dropping this is not it.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.520]   This is not a show for women.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:53.200]   I looked up flow podcast and it went to bloodstream media.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.080]   So I would say, say the URL again, flow.ecam.com.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:04.760]   I knew I was teaching the workflow of how to generate a podcast from a video first.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.760]   Perfect.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.560]   And the thing is, I was like, you know, one of the first things I did when I got my Apple
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.760]   TV one, the one that looks more like a Mac mini than the Apple TV.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.760]   Oh, the old one.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.360]   And subscribe to all of the Twitch shows.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.360]   Thank you.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.880]   And it used to be on the, you know, first button.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.160]   Cause at that time, not video podcasts out there.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.520]   And then most people don't remember that Apple had a button for video and that the button
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   is now gone.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.040]   So you have to go look for video podcast, but it's been a big thing.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.280]   If you and Katie want me to come on, I will be or, or Lisa, cause our, Lisa, my wife
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.400]   and our CEO is also really good at explaining the economics of a video podcast.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.200]   This is better looking to you a lot better looking.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.800]   I love you the most.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.840]   When you just let me know, I'll be glad, I'll be glad to do that.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.480]   And Denise howl.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.960]   I miss this week in law.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.360]   I know I do too.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.240]   And we all have podcasts coming out of our years on this episode of Twitch.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:08.120]   Apparently I am so grateful to know about the flow.ecam.com podcast.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.640]   Cause I'm definitely going to watch that.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.840]   I'm going to recommend it to some folks I'm working with.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.520]   Cause I am going to have my own podcast again.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:21.760]   I don't think that I'm allowed to say where or when my partner in this is very cloak and
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:27.840]   dagger about what we're doing and when and where it's all happening, but it's soon.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.840]   It's soon.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   I am so glad to hear that.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.960]   I get my own show and I'm co-hosting a show with him.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:37.160]   So please when you, when you, when you launched, come back and tell us cause I want to plug
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.000]   it like crazy.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.800]   I wish we were still doing this week in law, but I'm just glad somebody is there.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   That's great.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   That's.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.200]   Yeah, no, it's not going to be this, this week in law is going to be slightly different,
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.960]   but it will be fun.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.000]   I've got a couple of shows in the can already.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.120]   And so yes, you'll be the first to know.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.200]   And there are still, of course, many episodes of this week in law, almost 500 of them on
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:02.040]   our website at twit.tv/twil.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.000]   Our show today is brought to you by IT Pro TV.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.840]   Actually this is a related thing because IT Pro TV was started by two guys, Tim Broom
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.960]   and Don Pazette who were IT trainers, but in a more traditional classroom setting.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.000]   And this was some years ago at NAB.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.480]   I was on a panel with Adam Corolla and some others talking about video and podcasting way
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.520]   back when in an AB.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.120]   And Tim and Don were at the panel.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:34.040]   We talked afterwards, they said, you know, maybe we could do this with IT training.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.880]   And it was there that the, the idea for IT Pro TV was born.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:43.600]   Now fast forward about eight or nine years and IT Pro TV is huge.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.360]   They've done so well.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   They launched in 2013.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:52.920]   They now have seven studios open every day, eight AM to six PM creating great new content.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.840]   You can watch IT Pro TV on your TV.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.680]   You can watch it on your computer.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:03.400]   They have apps for, you know, all the major platforms like Apple TV.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:09.840]   You can actually learn IT the easiest possible way.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.240]   And let me tell you, if you've got a business, it's not just for people getting into IT.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.200]   You have an IT team.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.560]   You need them to keep up on this, right?
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:26.200]   Because IT is constantly changing to recertify, to learn new skills, to polish up old skills.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.200]   Now you might set up a training system for them, but you got to make sure you do one
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.600]   that they're looking to love that they're going to use in that IT Pro TV.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:39.600]   80% of users who start a video on IT Pro TV go all the way through because it's engaging.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.720]   It's fun.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   They really know what they do.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.280]   They have instructors, they call them edutainers.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:52.600]   They're experts in the field, but they also communicate so well, they're passion for IT.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.960]   They communicate that knowledge.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:43:00.560]   And that's what keeps you engaged in the shows, 5,800 hours of training.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.200]   You can get all the training inserts for your team done in one place.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:09.840]   Every vendor, every skill you need, Microsoft, Cisco, Linux, Apple, security, cloud, everything
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.320]   you want your team to know.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.920]   And their dashboard is great for the business plan.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.920]   You can track team results, manage seats, assign and unassign team members, access,
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.440]   monthly usage reports to make sure that your investment is paying off.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.560]   You'll see all the metrics you need, logins, viewing time, tracks completed and more.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.920]   You can create your own subsets of users.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.520]   So you can say, "You three," you need to look at this.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:37.840]   GZ, "You three," you can study this, you can study that.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.560]   Assignments can be individual episodes all 20 to 30 minutes.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.880]   So you could say, "Hey, your lunch break, I want you to watch this," or you could do
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.480]   full courses.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.840]   And they've got all the advanced reporting you need to get insight into your team's viewing
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.400]   patterns and progress over any period of time.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.360]   If you've got to justify it to the guys upstairs and the C-suite, you get beautiful visual reports
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:02.480]   that will really show you and show them the progress your team is making.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.160]   So whether you're an individual looking to get into IT, an IT professional looking to
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:11.360]   expand your knowledge, or you've got a team that you want to keep up to date, IT Pro TV
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.720]   is a one-stop shop.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.200]   Give your team the IT development platform.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.440]   They need to level up their skills while enjoying the journey.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.600]   I mean, enjoying it.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.800]   For teams of any size, from 2 to 1,000, volume discounts started five seats.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.840]   Go to ITPro.tv/twit.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.720]   And if when you're talking to your account executive, you mention the secret word, "Twit
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:40.400]   30," "Twit 3-0," you can get at least 30% off, maybe even more on a business plan.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.920]   "Twit 30," that's the offer code, ITPro.tv/twit.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.920]   We thank them so much.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.720]   I congratulate Tim and Don on the job they've done.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.960]   They've really made this into the best place to learn IT.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.880]   And I feel a little bit proprietary about it.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.560]   We've been with them ever since then.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.600]   ITPro.tv/twit.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:04.800]   Offer code, "Twit 30," thank you, ITPro.tv for supporting this week in tech.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.400]   I'm curious what you all think of this.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.840]   Google is going all in.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840]   They're buying ads.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:16.560]   They've created a site to get Apple onto the RCS bandwagon.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.840]   It's time for Apple to fix texting.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.520]   It's not about the color of the bubbles, says the website.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.160]   It's the blurry videos, the broken group chats, the missing read receipts and typing
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.200]   indicators, no texting over Wi-Fi and more.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   Is this going to work?
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.120]   What do you think, Brian?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.160]   Is this a good strategy for Google?
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:46.400]   I don't think so because, first of all, the rest of the world is on WhatsApp, right?
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:52.920]   I met with somebody from Singapore this past week and it's like, "Here's my phone number."
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.720]   He's like, "What are you talking about?
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   We're connecting on WhatsApp."
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.920]   I'm like, "Oh, yeah, that's right."
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.600]   The rest of the world is already locked down.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:08.360]   Here in North America, at least with the younger folks, you've got iMessage sort of.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.560]   Essentially, all they're trying to do, what they wanted to be-
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.000]   I'm sorry, I just planned every year.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.480]   They want to get rid of the green bubble.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.000]   They're making the argument of, "Well, messaging should be a standard, which generally I'm
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.320]   in favor of," except for the fact that they're shoving a standard that most of the world
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.040]   kind of doesn't need or want.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:36.760]   This would require people rewriting stuff from the ground up and people adopting new
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   things.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.720]   Yeah, I don't think that there's anywhere for them to go.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:45.280]   This is just, to my mind, a naked play at the regulators to try to put on-
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:51.160]   Oh, the audience is not Apple or Apple users, it's regulators.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.160]   That's interesting.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   I hadn't thought about that.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.600]   Because Apple users are just going to thumb their- this is stupid.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.720]   I don't want- yes, you're a green bubble.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.720]   Get out of me.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.360]   Get out of my life.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.360]   Apple users are perfectly happy with messages.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.360]   Right, Doc Rock?
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.360]   100%.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:11.040]   And I think RCS is more problematic.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:17.720]   If anything, it would probably be better on our end to open up the iMS inside and let
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720]   them in.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.200]   But that would be hard too because the thing that makes iMS is works is you know what
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:28.320]   devices are talking, so it can be easier to secure.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.400]   The disadvantage of the Android platform is it's everywhere.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.720]   So you can find all kind of random things.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.520]   I just got this really cool live streaming box called Yolo Box Pro and I just realized
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.160]   recently it's basically an Android box.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.040]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.040]   I don't know.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.000]   I think we can never get to this RCS thing no matter what you're trying to do.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.880]   Google says it's not about the color of the bubbles.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.240]   iPhone users get a bad texting experience.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.240]   Really?
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.240]   No we don't.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.040]   I don't think so.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.040]   Really?
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.040]   You want a bad texting experience?
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:04.160]   The bad is sending a text and then getting rid of it.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.640]   I've been having so much fun playing with that.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.400]   Oh yeah, the disappearing, the disappearing text.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.600]   The disappearing that thing is glorious because we have all sinned and it's not even just because
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.120]   you want to say something angry and deleted.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.440]   It's just messing up and then you know wanting to fix it.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.760]   So yeah, it's like the delete button on Twitter.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.120]   We actually have it come in September to the regular Muggleverse.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.040]   But again, the tell is.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.040]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.920]   Oh, go ahead and then I'll probably come right here.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:39.320]   I was going to tell you what an intriguing idea you've had about this being aimed at
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.480]   regulators.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:45.400]   But I'm just trying to think through that and understand, okay, what would catch the
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.640]   regulators' attention.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:53.800]   Regulators are already upset with Apple about things like the App Store.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.480]   Is the blue box a sufficient, you know, cornering of the market?
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.520]   There are so many other texting alternatives that aren't Apple.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.760]   I don't think it's really an anti-trust concern.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.520]   But see, that's the tell that I think that they're targeting regulators with this because
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.560]   if they want it to be really expansive and be like, you know what?
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.040]   Messaging should be an open standard like email like any number of other things, right?
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.400]   Then they would be including meta in this.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.360]   They would say, hey, by the way, telegram everybody, let's integrate this one standard.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.880]   So this is the baseline standard in the same way that you have baseline SMTP and all this
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.880]   good stuff.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.160]   They're not.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.280]   They're going after specifically Apple and these ads are in the United States.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.840]   So that says to me, there's one specific argument.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.840]   I think you may.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:40.840]   This makes a lot more sense.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.760]   I mean, Apple users are just going to say, yeah, right, Google.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:49.360]   And I think Android users are going to say, Google, you have the worst messaging history
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:56.920]   in the world, you're telling us that you should, after Aloe and Hangouts and chat and meet
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:01.200]   and duo, you're telling us you've got a better way.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.840]   Give me a break.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.520]   I don't think anybody buys this.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:11.200]   Remember when we were all like just gung ho to get that Google wave invited wave?
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.160]   I remember when Aloe came out, actually Aloe was a pretty good solution.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:22.440]   But I think you also, you nailed this, Brian, that nobody really is even using SMS messaging
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   anymore.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.480]   They're all using data based messengers.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:30.440]   In fact, here is a map of the world, most popular messaging apps worldwide.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.560]   Apple's messages is not even on the list.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.120]   Facebook messengers big in North America.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.400]   What's app is 31% of the market.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.640]   They're the largest telegram, 4%.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.280]   And then of course in Asia, you've got WeChat and Line.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:53.040]   It's just not, Apple's not even in this mix.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.200]   Wait, who's the blue?
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.200]   Blue is Line.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   What's up?
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   Oh, what's up?
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   Line is light blue.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.720]   Yeah, that's not good.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   What's up?
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   Dominate.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.720]   Yeah, 31%.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.720]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.320]   Yeah, that's what's up.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:19.040]   It is a broken system because there's, you know, if you're on WhatsApp and your buddies
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.840]   on Telegram, want to use got to give, it is a broken system.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:23.840]   There's no interoperability.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:29.160]   Right, which again, if that was the tack they were taking, which is, you know what?
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.800]   Let's clean this all up.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.880]   Let's let everything interoperate.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.160]   Everyone join us.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.320]   They're not taking that tack.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:39.520]   They're taking the tack of attacking one particular competitor and not even as you're
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.440]   pointing out the most popular competitor.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.120]   You know, can I ask a question to all of you?
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:56.240]   How have the telecommunications carriers let WhatsApp gain their market share here?
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:01.600]   I was sitting here thinking the exact same thing is like when we when SMS first started
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:07.680]   getting attacked, how did nobody pivot into less figure this out before they lost control?
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.000]   So you are audit 115.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.240]   I'll tell you the answer.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.360]   Do you remember how expensive SMS was?
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.640]   You were paying a couple of bucks for like a megabyte worth of data.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.960]   I mean, like more than that, it was ridiculously expensive.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.080]   They made so much money on SMS.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.200]   They didn't want anybody to leave SMS.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:33.280]   Classic innovators dilemma because the innovation was this is 100% free.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.160]   Although what's app charged a dollar a year or something?
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:41.080]   You know, there was there's no way that AT&T and Verizon 15 years ago were going to be
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.080]   like, you know what?
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.480]   Turn it all off.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.880]   The billions of dollars were making on text messages.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.680]   Turn it off tomorrow and we're going to give this away for free.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.520]   They would never do that until they were forced to.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.880]   In fact, you know, their answer to this was stopped charging for SMS just built it into
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.640]   your bill effectively because nobody pays per message anymore.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.880]   But in the early days of SMS, not even that long ago, everybody paid per message.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.080]   It was hugely profitable for them.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.080]   Right.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:12.080]   That's why you still get these weird disclaimers about, you know, messaging fees may apply.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   What are those?
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.080]   Cool.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.160]   It's kind of famous.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:24.200]   Where they missed a boat was at that time, ad rev from, you know, better ads and, you
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.480]   know, web stuff was very big at the time.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.360]   If they started it back in the day where, you know, every couple of messages you would
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:36.040]   get a message from Pepsi or Coke or Expedia or whatever, and we would have gotten used
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.840]   to it and not cared.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.720]   And they would own the ad rev space right now.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:46.640]   Imagine if WhatsApp figured out a way to turn ad revenue into their chatting platform.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.880]   You know, they just, they would just be bigger.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.520]   So it's funny because they could have found a way to pay for what they thought they were
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.160]   losing money on, but they just didn't think about it.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.160]   They were being greedy.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.360]   They were thinking about it.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:05.400]   In fact, I remember the founders of WhatsApp left Facebook in a huff because Facebook was
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.920]   going to introduce ads into WhatsApp and they were furious about it.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.120]   I mean, I mean, the telecoms.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.600]   Oh, the telecoms.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:17.080]   Well, you would think the telecoms would have said, well, I mean, that's what RCS, I guess
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:23.600]   is, is a late answer to this conundrum of, Oh, shoot, we're losing everybody to Apple's
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:29.400]   messages and WhatsApp and, and all of this.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:35.840]   But I remember Google was pushing RCS for a long time and the telecoms didn't even want
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   it.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.800]   It took them a long time to come along.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.840]   I don't know if they're technical issues as well.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   We actually had something I thought really good called the XMPP.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.880]   There was a really good messaging protocol.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.560]   It was cross platform.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.720]   It could work with SMS.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:58.320]   If everybody at Google initially supported XMPP, if everybody had supported that, we might
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.960]   have had a solution, but it was a fact Google even abandoned it for a long time.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:10.000]   It was the universal messaging standard in the until about five or six years ago.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.520]   Remember famously, Steve Jobs said they were going to open source FaceTime as well.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:20.400]   So everybody, everybody when it's convenient for them talks about how interoperability for
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.080]   messaging should be a thing.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.080]   Nobody wants it.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.080]   They all want silos.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:31.280]   Remember we used to have Pigeon and what were those multi messenger programs?
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.760]   They were great.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.760]   Addium on the Mac.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.760]   Addium, yeah.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.960]   I see, I see Q was was not I mean, I mean, I was dominant.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:43.520]   Remember, but then there was a name and so it was one thing that would one messaging app
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:48.440]   that would use aim and I see Q and Trillion was another one.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.440]   I think those were the big.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.440]   I think you use Addium.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.920]   Addium is on the Mac.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.040]   Trillion was on PC.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.680]   Those are the big three.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:00.360]   I really thought text America was going to dominate the market.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   More blogging.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.360]   More blogging.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.600]   God, that's a memory from the past.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.520]   God, what was that one?
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.800]   It's like a posted note app that I used to use.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.120]   It was called post something and I was just, I thought it was the coolest thing to just.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.240]   There's a, there's a really missed opportunity.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:25.520]   But boy, I have thought about text America and so long they were dominant both in Mo
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.360]   blogs, right?
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.280]   Mobile, they were the first, they were before Instagram.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.920]   There was text America was an online photo site.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.440]   They called it Mo blogging.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:38.160]   Oh, I know what it was called.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.680]   It was called post IO.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.660]   I think that's what it was called post.
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:42.660]   Post.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.660]   Post.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.660]   Post.
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:45.660]   Post.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.660]   Post.
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:50.620]   You know, we're getting old and we're thinking about technologies that nobody, nobody, they
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.740]   go, what are you, what are these people talking about?
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:55.260]   What are they talking about?
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.940]   And this is, this is just what we do now.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.780]   We sit around and talk about.
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.300]   Remember the text America.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.780]   I was all in the text American.
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.820]   It was about two, it was 2006.
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.140]   They be, this is what happened.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:13.500]   They were free and then they started charging membership fees in July, 2006.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.820]   By December 2007 history.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:21.020]   This, but you know what, Leo, what you're talking about, like that gets into like the
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:26.060]   recent story about how the Kardashians and everybody had that backlash about Instagram
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:30.980]   and, and someone made a, someone much more than me made the point that this is true for
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:36.180]   everyone that like you have nostalgia for social media for when you first discovered the
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:41.220]   platform and it was perfect because it was just your friends and you were expressing yourself
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:45.580]   for the first time and every generation sort of has that sort of experience, you know,
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.940]   going back to geo cities and, and what have you.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:54.900]   So like, it's, it's inevitable that it's sort of like, you know, no one goes there anymore.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:55.900]   It's too popular.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:01.220]   Like everybody has that platonic ideal of what it was like when they first found a platform.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:06.780]   And then, you know, five, six years on, 10 years on when your boss is on there, your grandmother's
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.460]   on there, you kind of hate it.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:15.780]   You know, Brian, it's funny you say that because when IG first came out, we were at like Mac
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:19.260]   World 2012 or 2010, something like that.
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:25.540]   And I remember because when I got the, the post that IG was coming out, Leo and a bunch
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:30.020]   of people and the, they were doing a talk on the stage, which was at the back of the hall
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:35.580]   in Moscone and we were in the two out booth just freaking out of his new IG thing.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:43.300]   I remember the later that day, the only thing to argue about IG was, is it okay to post a
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.260]   picture later?
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:48.020]   And then used to be like, no, this is not later Graham.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.300]   You got to post it when you get it.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.180]   And then it switched within a matter of days.
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.180]   This was to that's taken with DSLR.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:56.180]   Yes.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.180]   That's what that camera phone.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.980]   What are you putting your DSLR photos on there for?
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.820]   But doc, this is what I'm talking about with the cycle.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:06.780]   What's that be real thing that supposedly the new hot social over it is?
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.900]   It has to be an instant photo.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.900]   It's just already over.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.900]   I'm sure.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.700]   Isn't be real already over the last numbers I saw.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.700]   The numbers will be real.
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:18.700]   The app.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:26.540]   In fact, now, according to TechCrunch, the CEO of be real had to send out a message to
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:31.580]   people at the company to stop you being careful about be real.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:35.060]   So the idea be real was it would pop up a message on your phone.
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.060]   Okay.
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.620]   Now take a picture, whatever you're doing, because it's real life.
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:42.700]   And it would take a picture with both the front facing and the back facing camera.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.820]   So it get you as a selfie and whatever you were doing.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:50.700]   But people were doing it and not realizing they were revealing corporate secrets.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:52.700]   Right.
[00:59:52.700 --> 01:00:01.540]   So this is from the CEO of be real.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:05.420]   I saw a post on LinkedIn this week from an old buddy of mine.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.980]   We were on a squash team together.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:12.580]   The Dave is an analyst at Goldman now and said his summer intern tipped him off on secret
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.820]   data from Morgan Stanley.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:19.260]   How did she find out her friend posted it on be real?
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.020]   She took a selfie at her desk.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.900]   But on the other side of the camera, right on the laptop, were trade secrets out in the
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:30.420]   open ready for anyone to steal.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.860]   So be careful while you be real.
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:39.900]   And I think isn't the other I haven't used it, but isn't the other trope of it that everybody
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.340]   does this at the same time.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.060]   So it's almost like a point.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.460]   No, you have one window in it.
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:45.900]   Well, in a day.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:49.500]   So I think it changes regionally and the time changes every day.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.300]   Like so it's not three o'clock for everybody every day, right?
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:58.380]   But you do only get one window a day so that the idea is is that immediacy of it's not
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:01.740]   the asynchronicity of something you're doing right now.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.740]   Right.
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.740]   It's what I'm doing right now.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.740]   It's what you're doing right now.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.740]   It's what everyone's doing right now.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.060]   But I don't think it was like a day in the life where it was everybody at the same time.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.900]   I think it was kind of somewhat random nice.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:18.340]   The other thing was if you missed that window, which I the implication was that you are constantly
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:23.500]   have your phone turned on because you only have a few minutes when that alert goes, I
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.980]   would miss it every time.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:30.660]   But then you could like a Tardy student post a late be real and it would be and it would
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:35.940]   be marked Leo posted this three hours late.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:41.020]   And unless you posted it, you couldn't see your friends be real from that day.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:43.260]   The whole thing was just scolding and stupid.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.700]   And it's I think it's I think it's had its day already three seconds later.
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.340]   It's over.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:53.420]   It's actually it's actually been around since 2020.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.260]   It's just as is often the case, you know, somebody discovers it then an influencer uses it and
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.820]   all of a sudden everybody's using it.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:06.900]   But you know, look, that again, to put this in the context of how social networks succeed,
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.900]   that's a gimmick, right?
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.900]   That may or may not pay off for them.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.700]   But so was Snapchat at the beginning.
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:17.500]   So the key for having a social network that lives on is you have to have a gimmick that
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.660]   makes it different.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:24.060]   And then you have to be around long enough to again hook a generation into what talking
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.100]   to each other.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:28.240]   So it's like you you you hook them with the gimmick.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.900]   And then if you can keep them around long enough that a cohort of 16 to 21 year olds,
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.660]   that's where they go to talk with their friends, then it doesn't matter what the gimmick is.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.180]   You can then go on and do stories.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.180]   You can go on and do all these other things.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:45.500]   It's but but in the end, what makes a social network stick is we all get hooked on whatever
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.500]   network again, based on a certain age or something.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.780]   And then that's how we communicate with our friends.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.020]   Twitter was what 108 characters, right?
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.020]   420.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.020]   Right.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.620]   And I'm sitting here trying to remember what its original prompt was.
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:01.620]   Was it what's happening?
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.620]   So it was like what's happening right now?
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:13.260]   But then the thing with Twitter is it evolved and they listened to users and involved judiciously.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.020]   There was a good article though in The New Yorker.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.180]   We've been kind of talking about this all week.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.780]   This was at the end of July.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.900]   TikTok and the fall of social media giants.
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.820]   And the premise is social media is over.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:32.420]   So what was the promise of Facebook and Twitter at social media in the early days?
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:37.060]   It was you follow your friends, your family, your high school girlfriend, your high school
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:40.300]   boyfriend, you know, you follow the people you care about and you'll get updates about
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.300]   their lives.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.300]   It was social.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.300]   It was a great group.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.420]   But what quickly happened, and I think you'll blame YouTube for this, is the rise of the
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.580]   creator.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:51.500]   And now all the social platforms have become creator platforms.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.540]   That's what's happening in Instagram.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.820]   It's stopped being about the pictures your friends post and it's turning into TikTok
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:04.500]   because YouTube and TikTok succeed because creators are creating compelling content
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:09.140]   that you spend more time looking at than your friends and family ever did.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.420]   And Facebook realized this.
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.860]   They went to the algorithm.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.820]   So the premise of this article by Cal Newport and I think it's accurate is that what you're
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:21.500]   really seeing is the rise of creator media and the fall of the social network.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   Discuss.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:26.100]   Well, that's why the real was there, right?
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.660]   But you disagree.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:28.660]   Doc Rock?
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.340]   No, no, I'm a content creation coach.
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.340]   This is my job.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.580]   That's what you do is content.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.380]   I teach people how to use the content.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.380]   I hate the words.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.020]   I'll just use them because they work, people understand them to use the content creator
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:46.820]   economy to either expand your businesses, launch new businesses like get out there.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:53.300]   This is literally what I teach people because if you really spend some time on YouTube and
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:57.780]   look at the good content that's out there, which there are a lot, but it's so much fun
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.140]   to make fun of the trash, right?
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:04.660]   If you're on Instagram reels or TikTok, even looking at some of the great contents out
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.980]   there, there's a lot, but it's so much fun to make fun of the trash.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.620]   And this is what people do.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:15.580]   And anybody who back in the day was a film buff.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:19.580]   Christina Warren and I used to talk about movies all the time when we were at talk.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:23.580]   And she's the legitimate film buff, right?
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.940]   We knew what good movies were.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:27.300]   And people would be like, "Oh, there's nothing good at the cinema and plates."
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.380]   No, maybe not, but there's some dope movies out there.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.620]   You just got to go find them.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.780]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.780]   And you're right.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:39.100]   I think that content creator generated media in the next five or six years are going to
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.980]   blow past everything that's out there.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:48.740]   And even the Amazons and the Apple and the Netflix are starting to pick up on smaller
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.460]   production houses as opposed to the big stuff.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.580]   But there's so much money at their big show.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.580]   You were right.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:57.580]   You said that's what Be Real was trying to do was create a social.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.260]   But I think it's why kids are still on snap too.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.700]   They're not on snap to follow Beyonce or whatever.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.580]   They're on snap to be with their friends.
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:10.540]   And I think why Discord, for instance, you know, aren't Discord in the club, that's become
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:14.740]   a social network because it's just, there's no ads, there's no algorithm that doesn't
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.820]   surface content that's sticky.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.540]   It's just what people are talking about.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:25.780]   The New York article also points out a hazard because Facebook, when it was your friends,
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.940]   you couldn't leave Facebook.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.620]   That's where your friends are.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:33.900]   As soon as it just becomes content, another TV channel, it's no longer sticky.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:39.220]   That's why TikTok can beat them because TikTok's doing a better job of surfacing creative
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.180]   content.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:44.980]   And really, if you think about it, TikTok is just a TV channel.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:45.980]   Right?
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:48.180]   That's all it ever said.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.180]   It's yes.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:52.180]   For me, anyway, I mean, everybody's feet is different, right?
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.020]   But there's a whole lot of food.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.020]   Everybody's feet is different.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.020]   Yes, exactly.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:01.940]   It's a TV channel that is algorithmically and very sensitively and cleverly algorithmically
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.940]   tuned to just what you want.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:05.940]   And you want food.
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.380]   It doesn't look like a channel for people.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:09.380]   Yes.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:13.060]   So instead of the food, you don't watch the, you might watch the Food Network at a niece,
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.060]   right?
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.060]   But that doesn't...
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.060]   Ooh, no, I only watched TikTok.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.780]   TikTok has become your food network.
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.180]   And for me, it's the bikini network.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.140]   And for, you know, it's different from, no, it's not.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.140]   I'm just kidding.
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.700]   But because my son is a food creator and he's done very well on TikTok.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.660]   So I do get a lot of food as well.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.420]   But it becomes...
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:35.700]   Imagine, what if when you turn on your TV, your TV was so smart that it knew exactly
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:40.380]   what you wanted to watch at this very moment and put on shows and, because we're all short
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:44.500]   attention span, you flick up, you flick up, you get the next show.
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.100]   It's always constantly entertaining.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.540]   That's why you have to spend up spending, you know, waking up at four in the morning,
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:54.420]   having spent four hours of vital sleep time on TikTok.
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.060]   It's brilliant.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.060]   And TikTok rocks point...
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.060]   The secret thing is...
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.060]   Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.060]   Go ahead, then it's then, Doc.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:05.740]   YouTube, YouTube is that as well, just in a longer, more produced format.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.260]   YouTube taught us.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.300]   YouTube was the first to do it, I think.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.300]   Go ahead, Doc.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:15.380]   What I've been talking to my people about a lot is for all my friends or, you know,
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.180]   students that come to me and they're saying, "Well, I don't like the way the algorithm
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.180]   works."
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.860]   And I'm like, "You know you can control the algorithm."
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:22.300]   And they're like, "What do you mean?"
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:27.540]   I was like, "When you see something that you like, don't just hit the heart button.
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:28.540]   Leave an actual comment.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.900]   Leave a relevant comment or something of that nature.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.700]   If you see something that you don't like, do not comment on it.
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:38.100]   Do not go to tell that person they're dumb.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:41.500]   Do not go to tell the person you hate them or whatever.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.580]   Just let it go, Elsa.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.980]   And if you do that, it's all good.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.580]   And of course, subscribe because that tells the algorithm.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.580]   Yes, and subscribe.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.660]   Subscribe is important.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:55.220]   So give the merit where the merit is due.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.500]   Like the things that you like.
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.060]   Conversate with the people or even the people in the chat and stuff you like.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:03.180]   And the algorithm will show you exactly what you ask for.
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:06.140]   But if you're out there talking about all the stuff you hate, the algorithm will just
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.420]   keep showing it to you.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:10.020]   So like you actually control the algorithm.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:14.580]   And by the way, this is why I'm announcing my retirement because I can't possibly compete.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:19.940]   I do three hour shows and somebody in the chat room is pointing out.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.460]   And I don't pay any attention to what you're interested in.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.180]   I have no way of knowing this week in TT.
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:30.140]   This week in TikTok with Leo, I'm just waiting for the dance.
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:34.420]   Rev just posted, "Devo released with 42 years ago.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.420]   I'm old."
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:38.300]   Devo released with it 42 years ago.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.740]   That was my thing when I was a kid.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:41.740]   I was in high school.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:42.740]   With the flower pots.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.180]   So with that.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.980]   Gummy, I could change my mind cover to purple if you want, but not in the middle of the
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:51.980]   show.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:52.980]   I like the orange.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:53.980]   I think it's good.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:58.380]   I think our generation has to just take a victory lap because the 80s and the 90s, first
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.700]   of all, they were great to kind of live through while we were there.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.700]   And now they're just back.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.300]   There's so much nostalgia for those time periods.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.300]   Yes.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:10.580]   There's a lady on TikTok and IG.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.740]   I forget her name and something CS.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:18.380]   And she does these things where she's showing the Gen X and loving this song.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.060]   I'm sorry, the Gen Z's loving this song.
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:21.940]   And the millennials pushed it out of way.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.740]   And then they listened to the version, that's the millennial version.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.020]   And then we come in and it's like, "No, it's actually older than you think."
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.580]   We slide them out of the way.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:34.580]   And then so the most recent one is off the TomTom Club track, which is like was then
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.180]   Mariah Carey Fantasy for the millennials.
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:41.380]   And then now it's some other song with the big, big energy.
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.060]   And it's like, "Man, TomTom Club is 1977 player.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.060]   You're only with you."
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:49.060]   You guys, you're making me feel really old because I, for years, have been saying, "Bang
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.620]   a gong was originally T-Rex.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.980]   Forget this twisted sister."
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.140]   So it comes around.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.460]   It goes around and it comes around.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:01.740]   I'll never forget years ago, listening to the high school marching band.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.940]   We used to live in a house on the hill that we'd hear the high school marching band.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:08.500]   And then they would have lunch and they'd play rock music.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.540]   And it was always music from the '60s and '70s.
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.860]   I thought, "This is something going on.
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:13.940]   This is very strange."
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:19.900]   So maybe this is what happens is there's nostalgia for the stuff before you were born.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:24.100]   I do want to give credit, actually, to Scott Rosenberg, who was, I think, the founder of
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.460]   Solan, I want to say, used to write for the exam or anything.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:30.580]   Because he wrote in Axios, the sunset of the social network.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:37.500]   And it was he, I think, who first pointed out that these social network is being replaced
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:44.660]   now by the Discovery Engine, by the television channel, by TikTok and YouTube and so forth.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:50.060]   And it makes it hard for these companies to succeed because they just, like the phone
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:57.140]   company that missed the boat on SMS, it's the innovators dilemma, Brian.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:04.180]   It's hard to take that business that making a lot of money and say, "Yeah, it's over."
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:10.100]   Anyway, very interesting article from Scott Rosenberg on Axios.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.900]   Let's take a little break.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:16.620]   We will come back with more with our esteemed panel, Brian McCullough, from the Tech Meme
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.740]   Ride Home podcast.
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:20.820]   Do you ever do your internet history stuff anymore?
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.740]   I ask you that every time.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:29.460]   Every now and again, when, sorry, occasionally someone will reach out to me and I'll be like,
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.620]   "Oh yes, you qualify.
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:34.620]   I will dust off the history hat for you."
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:38.420]   But yeah, not really much anymore, seeing as how I do shows seven days a week.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.660]   Yeah, you don't have time.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.900]   Who got time for that?
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:41.900]   Right.
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:45.340]   By the way, I'm informed that Twisted Sister did not do bang or gong.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:49.940]   It was power station, but you knew that.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.340]   Also Doc Rock.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.780]   I'd like to have you, YouTube, or Doc Rock creative.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.700]   Are you happy to have Renee Richie now representing creators at YouTube?
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.700]   Absolutely.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.060]   It's so funny for two reasons.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.660]   One, because we needed a creator lays on YouTube in general.
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:07.460]   There was no one doing that?
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.820]   Nobody was really doing that.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:12.420]   Then it's funny, because I'm like, "Yo, Renee, I've been friends for years, so I feel like
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.980]   I got a man on the inside."
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.980]   That's kind of funny.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.980]   We do.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.940]   And it's not that I'm like, "I'm never going to bother him and call him up and be like,
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:23.100]   "Oh, man, I always call him R2."
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:28.020]   But yeah, I just really appreciate that they decided, and I wish more companies would think
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.140]   about that.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:34.900]   You need liaisons for the actual users of the platform or in their case, the creators
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:35.900]   of the platform.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.300]   So it was a very awesome move for Renee.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.180]   He well deserved it.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.380]   And yes, nice to have a homie on the inside.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.380]   Yes.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:49.980]   And Denise Howell, the one and only from @dhowl.info, @dhowl on Twitter.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:53.500]   I show today brought to you by a company I'm fond of.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.900]   I love these guys Mint Mobile.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.020]   You've seen the incredible Ryan Reynolds ads.
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.740]   I just love their attitude, their style.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:05.140]   Mint Mobile's doing I think is really important for consumers.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:12.420]   After years of fine print contracts and getting ripped off by big wireless, big cellular,
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.660]   if we've learned anything that we learned is always a catch.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:19.540]   So perhaps when I tell you, you're just not going to believe it.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:23.700]   When I tell you Mint Mobile offers premium wireless service at $15 a month, you're going
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.180]   to say, "No, Leo, because I'm going to end up paying three times that I know."
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.540]   No, it's not true.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.940]   I know because I use Mint Mobile.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:32.940]   There isn't a catch.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:38.260]   Mint Mobile's secret sauce is they're the first company to sell wireless service online
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.260]   only.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:42.380]   No stores saves them a lot of overhead.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:45.700]   And also really cheesy ads.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.460]   And they pass those sweet savings directly on to you.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.340]   Mint Mobile is really remarkable.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:59.140]   Premium wireless, all plans come with unlimited talk and text, unlimited plus high speed data
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.700]   on the nation's largest 5G network.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.900]   It's T-Mobile, I'll tell you.
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.540]   And you're paying only for what you need.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:13.620]   So for most people, $15 a month, which is 4GB of data a month is more than enough, check
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:14.620]   your bill.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.260]   See how much data you use every month.
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:20.220]   They have unlimited plans, $30 a month.
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:24.380]   I mean, and I bought the year-long plan.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.140]   It's a great deal.
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.900]   You can bring your own phone if you want.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.860]   They'll send you the SIM, no charge.
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.900]   Everybody else charges it for the SIM, not Mint Mobile.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:34.100]   So you can use your own phone.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.340]   Keep your phone number if you want.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.060]   You can move it over.
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:39.260]   Keep all your contacts and stuff where you can buy phones from them.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:42.860]   In fact, I got an iPhone SE for a great price from Mint Mobile.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:48.820]   Mint Mobile is just really about giving you the service you want from people who really
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.900]   love the biz.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:55.220]   Mint Mobile, get premium wireless service starting at $15 a month.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:56.700]   There's no catch.
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.660]   10GB, 20GB a month, 15GB.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:02.020]   That's the one I got, 15GB a month for $25 a month.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:03.860]   Or the unlimited plan.
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.620]   You pick what you need.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.940]   I think for most people, 4GB a month is plenty.
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:08.940]   That's $15.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.940]   What are you paying now for wireless service?
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.620]   A lot more than that.
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.860]   To get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped to your
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:21.180]   door for free, mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.340]   They got a family plan too?
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:27.500]   You bet mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.580]   Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month at mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.700]   Thank you, Mint Mobile, for doing what you do and for supporting our show.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.820]   We appreciate it.
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.740]   You support our show by using that address.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.060]   Please do because then they know you saw it here.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:45.140]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.660]   Here's a big C change.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.820]   I don't know what this means.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:52.300]   Maybe our esteemed panel can explain it.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:58.140]   For the first time ever in Q2, cable lost broadband market share.
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:00.700]   A negative growth quarter.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:05.980]   People are moving away from cable internet service.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:06.980]   How do we explain that?
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:13.740]   The top 7 US cable companies lost over 60,000 subscribers, April, May and June.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:18.460]   Comcast, the number one internet service provider in the country, was flat.
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.300]   Gained no new users.
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.780]   Number two, charter lost 21,000 customers.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:27.300]   Number three, Altisse lost 39,000 customers.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:32.220]   Is this just a blip or is this signaling a C change?
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.660]   Wasn't this the promise of 5G?
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:37.820]   5G was going to be so fast that it was going to be.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:43.900]   You add that to the fact that not everybody needs a computer.
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:49.060]   If you just do all of your computing on your phone and you can't really tell the difference
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.940]   in speed between...
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:56.500]   Remember, even if you have the best ISP in the world, you're still limited to your Wi-Fi
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.980]   speeds.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.220]   So maybe people are just like, "Hey, this is good enough.
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.220]   No worries."
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:03.980]   I think you nailed it.
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.140]   You know, I know the big thing.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.140]   I have a PS to that.
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.140]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.140]   Good.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:17.060]   The PS to that is for power users, cable can't get fiber to a lot of places.
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:22.500]   So I know that we dumped our cable to go with AT&T because they could get us fiber.
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.980]   Yeah, AT&T has been aggressive in rolling out fiber.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:30.180]   In fact, it's interesting because Google had stopped doing fiber, Google Fiber.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:34.940]   They just announced, I think, five new cities and they're going to be rolling out more fiber.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.900]   So maybe this is the fiber's time.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:38.980]   It's 5G's time, I agree.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:43.900]   Both T-Mobile and Verizon are selling home internet service now wirelessly.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:50.660]   For my daughter who lives near a highway, so she's near Verizon Towers, I bought...
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:58.060]   It's $25 a month, she's getting 150 megabits down, I think 20 up for nothing.
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:02.020]   And it's just a wireless box you put in there and you turn it on and it works.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.700]   Doc Rock, you were going to say something.
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:07.900]   I was going to say a couple of things that are going on as well.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:13.620]   When everybody started looking at places to sort of pinch pockets a little bit, if you
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:20.220]   have, for instance, Verizon, they were doing your Netflix streaming doesn't count against
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.220]   your bill.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:30.420]   So once each one of the companies has a thing that they offer for free without using your
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:31.660]   data plan or whatever.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:38.140]   So for instance, in AT&T, it was HBO, which I think might change now that it got sold.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:43.100]   But anyway, people are using that to watch what they need to watch or just ignoring the
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:47.580]   watching altogether and just watching the social stuff because like T-Mobile has streaming,
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.700]   you can stream stuff on YouTube or whatever without taxing your bill.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:55.540]   So then you don't need that at the house and you get your broadband outside at work or
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.100]   whatever to do the heavy lifting stuff.
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:03.220]   But most of your just consumption stuff, you can do on iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Android
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.380]   TV boxes and the like.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:07.620]   It's kind of like the end of the landline phone, right?
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.980]   People just doing everything on their cell.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:14.020]   It is the case that fixed wireless, that's what they call the T-Mobile and Verizon home
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.220]   internet.
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:20.620]   It's fixed wireless, huge growth, 816,000 new subscribers in Q4.
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:22.540]   Wait, what was that?
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:23.540]   816,000.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:24.540]   Wow.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:30.620]   So there you go.
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:35.820]   T-Mobile Verizon are seeing steady gains for their FWA fixed wireless services, which together
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:42.220]   picked up 816,000 subs in Q2, April, May and June of this year.
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:46.100]   Well, again, this is what they told us was going to happen.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.100]   It's happening.
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.100]   It's happening.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.540]   Got so jaded about the 5G showed up.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.540]   Right.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.540]   5G, 5G, 5G.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:58.100]   We're not having the telemedicine surgeries yet or whatever.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:02.300]   So I thought it was overblown hype, but maybe it's just now happening.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.260]   I mean, here's the cool thing to look out for.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:11.780]   If T-Mobile is growing at that clip and somehow I'm a Deadpool mobile subscriber, which runs
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:12.780]   on T-Mobile.
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:19.620]   So like if Ryan and Mrs. McElany can get over there and talk it up and get them to allow
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.940]   us to get one of these in the house, hey, it's on.
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:22.940]   I'm switching.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:23.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.340]   Wouldn't you love a mint mobile fixed wireless?
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.940]   I call it Deadpool mobile.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.980]   And my girlfriend's other boyfriend is Ryan Reynolds.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.340]   So I actually like him too.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:34.820]   I'm like, you know.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:35.820]   Hey, it's incredible.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.260]   It's absolutely incredible.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:42.420]   And I do believe if they could figure out a way to let some of the what I want to call
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:45.820]   them, MV and Ease, but that's a hard drive.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:46.820]   What do you call them?
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:47.820]   The smaller mobile companies.
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:48.820]   MV and O's.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:49.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:50.820]   MV and O's.
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:51.820]   Virtual.
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:52.820]   Virtual.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:53.820]   Get those guys on where they're using some of the others.
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:54.820]   It is spread quicker.
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:56.820]   Right?
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.340]   You know what, Leo, this is also, I just switched to a different carrier, which I won't
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.820]   name for various sponsor reasons and things like that.
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:05.820]   We should mention mint mobile is a sponsor.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.380]   Mint mobile is great.
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.140]   But do we know you don't have to say that at all.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.420]   You can even mention your other carrier.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:15.020]   They sponsor my show as well.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.020]   So I do love mint.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.020]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.380]   So you don't want to say the other carrier.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:23.900]   So, but the other thing that has just happened since I did that switch, I never used to get
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:28.180]   a millimeter wave and I have and I live in New York City.
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:30.300]   So that was also why I got jaded.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:33.060]   I was like, okay, it's it's a year two years in.
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.060]   It's just touching this on.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.300]   It's just tight.
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.940]   But now I've been getting it.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:37.940]   Really?
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.860]   It actually is noticeable that it's faster.
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:42.180]   So I don't I mean still a millimeter.
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:49.860]   Which is the fastest, you know, gigabit plus telco cellular data is very, very limited,
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:51.660]   both in locations and range.
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.420]   It only goes 800 feet.
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:58.940]   So you must be living your tower and and and weird places because it's on my walk.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.620]   I do walks and runs around Prospect Park.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:05.380]   And then Windsor Terrace on Prospect Park, South Wales, boom, it shows up.
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.380]   Exactly.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:09.900]   But then, you know, Grand Army Plaza where there's tons of people, it never shows up.
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:10.900]   Right.
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:12.900]   When it does show up, it is noticeable.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:13.900]   You will notice a difference.
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:17.780]   I think the big change though was the mid band, the rollout of the mid band.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.780]   So there are three bands.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:22.100]   There's millimeter wave, which is a very, very high frequency.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:27.100]   There's the 700 megahertz low frequency, which is really no faster than LTE.
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.580]   So you could be on it.
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:30.860]   Technically, it's 5G, but you'd never know.
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:32.220]   But and I'm seeing it here.
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:33.220]   I'm seeing it everywhere.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.220]   This is what my daughter is getting.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:40.060]   There's this mid band, which is very fast, is noticeably faster than LTE.
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:44.340]   That is being very widely rolled out by all the big three carriers.
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.300]   And I think that is really what's happening.
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.940]   And that's the, yeah, I, I like you, Doc.
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.820]   I mocked 5G.
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:54.420]   I remember, remember that Apple announcement?
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:24:00.820]   Not last year, but the year before where they said 5G every three seconds, you know?
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.740]   Maybe it was they were too early on that.
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:06.100]   Maybe they were jumping on this marketing thing.
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:07.740]   But I think it is now starting to happen.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.500]   And I think maybe that you're exactly right.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:14.100]   That's what's happening to Comcast chart or Cox, Altisse, MediaCom, Cable 1 and Breeze
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.100]   Line.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:21.380]   Now, I noticed that spectrum is not on the list, but it's funny because that's our building
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:23.420]   contract, you know, for the condo.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:28.300]   They just came in and stuck in all of the internal fiber lines.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:34.100]   So we're switching over to spectrum fiber in middle September while I'm on my road trip.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.580]   I think they're not on this list probably because they didn't announce their quarterly
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:39.660]   results this past week.
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:46.300]   But between the big broadband companies, they still have 75 million households of the 109
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.980]   million households that are getting broadband.
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:49.900]   So they're still dominant.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:51.500]   What was that number that you said?
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.620]   800,000 people in one quarter, one quarter.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.300]   That's, that's not significant.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.780]   I mean, they only have 2.2 million.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:02.100]   These are brand new services.
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:05.900]   And if they're growing at the rate of nearly a million a quarter, it ain't going to be
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:06.900]   long before.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:11.180]   And that's got to be growing at the, you know, the cost of the cable companies.
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:12.740]   I think that's very interesting.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.060]   Cable companies are suffering anyway.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:17.620]   People are watching streaming now.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:24.580]   This is, it's a fascinating time to watch the turmoil in streaming services and in cable
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.140]   companies.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.140]   And the battle.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:30.780]   And then now you're seeing, for instance, companies like Google and Apple come after
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.060]   sports contracts.
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:39.100]   We've talked before about the Sunday ticket, which is a 2.5 billion contract with NFL that
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.500]   direct TV paid one and a half billion for it.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.500]   What is it?
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:46.500]   Four or five years ago has been losing half a billion dollars a year on it.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.700]   It's not been a very good deal for them.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:54.660]   And they're not bidding on it when it comes up next year.
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:58.980]   But the companies that can't afford to bid two and a half billion dollars for Sunday
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:02.660]   ticket are Google, Apple, Amazon.
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:08.580]   These are companies that are not in the traditional broadcast business or the cable business.
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:13.660]   I would love Sunday ticket on Apple TV plus, but you got to make me one promise Apple.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:14.660]   You know, I love you guys.
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.500]   I used to work there.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:22.020]   Do not bring the cheeky announcement fee like you tried to do it.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.020]   Friday night baseball.
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.020]   Oh my God.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:26.020]   Oh my God.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:29.540]   Everybody was like, I'm checking to see which of my homies I used to work with.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:33.780]   I can call it yellow because that was just that was just brutal.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:38.980]   Leo and I would do a much better job like doing your games than what you call that feed.
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:39.980]   Don't do that.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:42.100]   But I would love for you to get NFL Sunday ticket.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:47.060]   They're also talking to get to big 10 athletics.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.580]   I think if Apple was smart, we've talked about this on Macbreak weekly.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:53.380]   If Apple was smart, they would use and they've got Major League Soccer, right?
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.620]   They've got the US Soccer League.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:27:02.380]   If they would use these as a test ground for doing a better job than the networks do,
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:04.580]   that's the real threat to the networks.
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:07.140]   What if we did it 4K?
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:12.220]   What if we used, you know, I don't know, modern technology?
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:14.460]   What if we put a camera in the huddle, you know?
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.460]   What if we did a better?
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:21.660]   What stuff with European football soccer, where they have the multiple cams that you can choose
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:23.300]   from and things like that?
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.300]   This is the opportunity for Apple.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.020]   I mean, they're a technology company.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.020]   Do that.
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.940]   And I'm a little disappointed that they haven't done that.
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:34.660]   All they did with Friday Night Baseball is have toned down graphics, stupid music behind
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:39.220]   the announcements and terrible play-by-play people.
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.660]   And I'm a hardcore footy fan.
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:46.100]   And I'm super happy that NBC got the contract and they do their best.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:52.300]   But they're so American that they don't realize they will put up the chiron on top of the players.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.300]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.100]   They have to figure out where to put the chiron.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:56.100]   No, no, no, no.
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:57.580]   And they keep covering up the action.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.300]   And I'm like, guys, guys, really?
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.300]   What are you doing?
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.300]   It's not the best.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.300]   You're talking the best.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.940]   I think the best sport in the world, Australian Rooze football.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.100]   Unbelievable sport.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.860]   These guys are wearing short shorts.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:12.220]   No pads.
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.220]   They're biting each other's ears off.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:20.660]   It's like-- and it's in mud and it's crazy, but it's so much fun to watch.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.820]   I think Apple's-- that's why Apple's doing soccer.
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:28.420]   I think Apple's really interested-- maybe you European types know it as football.
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:32.780]   But I think Apple's really interested in taking something that is not yet a huge sport in
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:37.660]   America but has the promise of becoming a huge sport and getting behind it and making
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:38.660]   it so--
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:44.260]   And a league that, because it's not the league or the sport, is willing to play ball with
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:45.260]   them, is willing to say--
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.260]   Absolutely.
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.260]   Yes.
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:51.100]   We've been the sport of the future in America since 1972.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.800]   Hat tip men and blazers.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:56.540]   So the NFL, you do a deal with the NFL.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.540]   They're going to tell you big 10.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:00.020]   They're going to tell you what you can and cannot do.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.580]   MLS is going to be like, what do you want to do?
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:03.580]   Let's try it.
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:04.580]   Let's try anything.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:07.500]   Look at the front page of MLS's website.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:11.820]   So big announcement coming in 2023 and it's got an Apple on it.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:15.740]   I mean, yes, it's huge for them.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.060]   And it's a 10-year deal.
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:23.140]   So I do hope Apple does a better job with soccer than they do right now with baseball.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:28.180]   I hope so too, especially for my Seattle Saunders fans in the building.
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.420]   Yeah, let's make this happen.
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:31.660]   Does Hawaii have a MLS team?
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:34.860]   No, that's why I got to be a Seattle Saunders fan.
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:35.860]   That's sad.
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:36.860]   Check his hat, Leo.
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:37.860]   Oh, my God.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:43.620]   For those of you not watching video, the black Ecamm hat has now been replaced with a
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:47.260]   Sounders lime green, very attractive.
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.260]   Sounders hat.
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.900]   I love Seattle, Sanders.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:50.900]   It's point.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:54.180]   Seattle's got way too many good teams.
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.140]   We're going to have to do something about that.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.140]   It's Paul Allen.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.180]   Yeah, it was Paul Allen.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:01.340]   Actually no, he brought Portland.
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:03.980]   He brought the Trailblazers because he couldn't get the Mariners.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.980]   So the Seattle NBA team.
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:07.980]   No, I can't remember.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:10.220]   It used to be a super signing super signing.
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:11.220]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:12.220]   They went to Oakland.
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.900]   That's not Oakland.
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:14.900]   Oklahoma.
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.340]   Oklahoma Oakland.
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:18.060]   It's all the same.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:20.420]   It's easily confused.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:21.900]   Did you want something to know?
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.900]   Yes.
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:27.140]   All I can think of is they're going to do a reality TV version of Ted Lasso.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.140]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:30.540]   So come to think of it.
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.980]   That's probably why Apple's interested in soccer.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.980]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:37.620]   Amazon already does that because they're doing my team right now, Arsenal.
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.180]   They've done it for about five years in a row now.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:41.180]   They follow.
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:44.620]   They get a team to allow their cameras into the locker rooms.
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:45.620]   Oh, it's all or nothing.
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:46.860]   Yes, I love all or nothing.
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:47.860]   Exactly.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:48.860]   They've been doing that with football.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:49.860]   Now they're doing with soccer.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:50.860]   That's all.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:55.100]   I started with Notre Dame back in day, which is funny because you mentioned Big Ten and
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:57.060]   everybody's trying to get us to join the Big Ten.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.460]   I don't want that to happen.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:01.940]   And then all or nothing was like Manchester City last year.
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.740]   And I'm so glad that they're not doing, I'm Manchester United fan.
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.820]   I'm glad they're nowhere near us because right now.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.380]   Oh, this is not the year for that.
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.380]   No, no, no.
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.540]   He's going to away from us.
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:11.860]   Leave us alone.
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:17.380]   If you want any evidence of how this can change a country's perception of sport, look
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:22.340]   at how F1 has taken off in the US thanks to drive drive to survive.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:27.840]   The Netflix show, I'm a brand new F1 fan because of that show that you see it like that or
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.020]   you see it like all or nothing.
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:32.180]   All I think is great is a great series.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.460]   And you suddenly you get it.
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:36.540]   You see the personalities, you understand what's going on.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.460]   It is the best thing that can happen to a sport.
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:45.300]   So I bet you anything Amazon is going to buy a soccer team anymore now or a league or a
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:46.300]   whole darn league.
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.540]   Why stop at a team?
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:52.580]   That was the big conversation this week as Amazon buying the Roomba.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:55.660]   Folks, I guess last week that was the big story.
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:58.020]   Wait, Roomba soccer?
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:59.020]   Oh my God.
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:03.460]   Oh, that would be like a good.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:08.180]   And then if you put some cats on top of the Roomba's playing soccer, you've got Roomba
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:10.740]   soccer cat videos.
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:11.980]   You can't lose.
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:14.740]   Put that on TikTok.
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.820]   Roomba soccer would just be legit.
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:19.780]   I love it.
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:20.780]   I love it.
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:21.780]   All right.
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:22.780]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:27.700]   Elon Musk sells more Tesla shares.
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:30.740]   We haven't done a good Elon story in a while, have we?
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:32.060]   It's time.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.060]   It's time.
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:38.540]   But first, worldwide technology and HPE.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:39.540]   We love these guys.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:43.620]   Worldwide tech is at the forefront of innovation working with clients all over the world to
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:46.500]   transform their businesses.
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:50.660]   These days, if you're an enterprise, you need to know about technology.
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.620]   You need to be engaged.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:55.860]   You need to see how it can change your business.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:58.860]   But to do that, you need a partner and you need a partner who understands business.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:32:59.860]   I think this is really important.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.660]   They're not just technologists.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:09.820]   WWT understands business, understands your strategy and is always working to make your
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.660]   strategy come alive using technology.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:15.020]   So that's the kind of partner you want.
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:20.740]   And it all starts for WWT at their ATC, their Advanced Technology Center.
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.940]   It's a research and testing lab.
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:24.500]   Used to be the magazines would do this.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:27.820]   Now, WWT's completely taken over.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:32.740]   It started about 10 years ago with a rack of equipment in one building.
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.620]   It's now in multiple buildings.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:40.300]   Over half a billion dollars in equipment in the lab, all the latest technologies.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:46.580]   And WWT's engineers use this to spin up proofs of concept, to do pilots so customers can select
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:50.700]   the best solutions, to test integrations with existing technology.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:54.100]   So they're really the experts in cutting edge technology.
[01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:59.220]   So it helps cut the WWT's evaluation time down from months to weeks.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:02.820]   Now their partners are using it and this is the biggest change.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:07.180]   Now WWT offers the ATC for you, for everybody.
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:09.980]   Anybody's a member of the ATC platform.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:10.980]   It's free to join.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:16.820]   Can get access to hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs like HPE's Primera Storage
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:22.540]   Lab, along with labs representing the newest advances in everything you'd want to find
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:23.860]   out about for your business.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.580]   Multicloud architecture, security of course.
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:31.580]   I'll never forget going to see the ATC and there was this whole rack, about three or
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:35.820]   four racks in a separate room, in a separate cage, completely separate.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:37.260]   I said, what are those?
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:42.940]   And they said, well, that's where we do our virus testing and our security testing, our
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:43.940]   exploit testing.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.740]   And we keep that air gap from the other ones off in a corner.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:48.740]   But you know what?
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:50.180]   That's how committed they are.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.020]   They really put the money into making this happen.
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:56.860]   You could study networking, of course primary and secondary storage, of all the storage
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:58.260]   solutions.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.540]   They all light up differently.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.900]   It's really quite beautiful.
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.660]   Data analytics, AI dev ops.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:10.300]   They're on top of all the latest technology, both hardware, software, operations, management
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.300]   compliance.
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:12.860]   They are the experts.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:18.420]   And thanks to the ATC, you can test out products and solutions before you go to market.
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:22.900]   Not just hands-on labs, you get access to technical articles, to expert insights, to
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:25.220]   demonstration videos and white papers.
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:28.500]   All the tools you need to stay up to date with the latest technology.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:34.980]   If you are a CIO, if you work in technology at a big company and you're not using the
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:39.420]   ATC, you're missing out on one of the most important tools you could have.
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:40.540]   It's a physical lab space.
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:44.900]   Sure, in St. Louis, we visited a couple of years ago, but it's completely virtual now,
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:48.380]   which means if you're a member of the ATC platform, you can access it anywhere.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:51.700]   In the world, any day of the year.
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:54.700]   And while you're there, check out WWT's events and communities.
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.020]   We did a great event for them.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.580]   It was so much fun.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:58.980]   They are doing lots of panels.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:00.020]   They have great communities.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:04.660]   So it's a chance to learn about technology trends and hear the latest research and insights
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.500]   from all the experts.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:12.820]   I am so impressed by WWT because they understand it's not just selling technology.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.220]   It's about empowering their partners.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:15.220]   It's about partnership.
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:16.220]   It's about community.
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:17.620]   And they do it so well.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:23.420]   Whatever your business needs, WWT can deliver scalable, tried, and tested tailored solutions
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.620]   for you.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:28.620]   They bring strategy and execution together to make this exciting new world happen.
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:35.220]   To learn more about WWT, the ATC to gain access to all these free resources, very simple,
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:37.020]   www.wt.com/twit.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.020]   Just go there.
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:41.020]   You can create a free account on the platform and have at it.
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:48.020]   WWT, worldwide technology at www.wt.com/twit.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.820]   It's time to make that new world happen.
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:52.820]   WWT is the partner you need.
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:53.820]   Thank you.
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:54.940]   And we're thrilled to partner with them too.
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:37:01.260]   Thank you, WWT, for supporting this week in tech.
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:03.700]   What is Elon up to?
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:11.780]   He just sold another big trench of stock, almost $7 billion worth.
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:21.580]   So that means he has now sold, how much Tesla stock, $32 billion worth of Tesla stock over
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:25.020]   the last year?
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:29.020]   Is it because he thinks he might be forced to buy Twitter?
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:30.780]   He offered $44 billion.
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:32.660]   That's one of the theories.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:33.780]   That's the other.
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:40.020]   The other theory would be that because a lot of people conspiracy theory being that he
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.940]   just wants the price to come down.
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:47.020]   But remember half of it is his money and half of it is all of the banks.
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:48.020]   You're talking about the Twitter price.
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:50.020]   He doesn't want the Tesla price to go down.
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:52.020]   He wants the Twitter price to go down.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:53.020]   Twitter price to come down.
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:56.540]   Yeah, but that's his fear because the Tesla price has been going down.
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:59.660]   Because he committed Tesla stock to this.
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:03.140]   But if all the banks and everyone else in the consortium that's doing the other half of
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:06.460]   this deal with him is getting cold feet.
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:10.380]   And because they're like, we don't want to be on the hook for this necessarily anymore
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.500]   because it's overpaying.
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:16.140]   So he's sort of giving himself a cushion that if he can get the price to come down, he could
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:21.140]   do the whole deal himself with all his money or at least most of his money.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:24.860]   Actually, I've been waiting for Denise to come on to ask about this because the trial
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:31.260]   is coming up October 17th in the chance to records in Delaware.
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:36.220]   What is, how is, is this different somehow from a regular court or is this just a funny
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:39.500]   name that Delaware uses for their court?
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.500]   It's mostly a funny name that Delaware uses for their court.
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:49.060]   They say it's widely recognized as the nation's preeminent forum for the determination of disputes
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:54.220]   involving the internal affairs of the thousands upon thousands of Delaware corporations.
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:58.060]   By the way, for no real reason, we are a Delaware LLC.
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:00.020]   Oh, no, there's a real reason.
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:01.260]   Oh, there is good.
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:08.820]   Well, yeah, because Delaware has very strategically over the years made itself the place where
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:10.700]   everyone wants to incorporate.
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:15.820]   It's very business advantageous in its laws.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:16.820]   So you pay for your tax.
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.460]   And in fact, I've told one of the reasons the chance record is part of that is because
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.460]   they're speedy.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:25.660]   And Elon wanted to slow this down.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.100]   He said, no, can we put this off?
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:29.260]   And they said, no, October.
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:30.060]   Yeah.
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:33.940]   So I think it's a trial court.
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:36.500]   It's like a superior court in any other state.
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:37.500]   Is there a jury?
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.620]   No, it's just a panel of judges or is there a jury?
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:45.180]   I believe it's, you know, that's a good question.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.020]   I don't see a jury box in this picture.
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:50.260]   I don't see a jury box in the picture either.
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:56.940]   But I don't think that, you know, incorporating as a Delaware corporation means that you
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:00.900]   waive jury trial if you have disputes.
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.500]   So I'm not quite sure, you know, again, this is-
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.700]   There must be a jury in most cases, yeah.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.540]   This is a contract case.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:12.700]   And there may be questions of fact as to, in fact, there probably are questions of fact
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:20.240]   as to what the evidence shows about what the parties didn't do and whether the court
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.500]   contract was breached.
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:25.580]   So I don't know if we're going to see a jury in this or not.
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:30.320]   I would be surprised, you know, the party's waver jury to be in front of this court and
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.020]   get more speed.
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:34.220]   That's something that could be the case.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:38.720]   Elon himself kind of implied that he's worried that this could go against him.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:44.420]   He tweeted when he sold the stock in the hopefully unlikely event that Twitter forces this deal
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:48.380]   to close and some equity partners don't come through.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:53.920]   And I don't even know if the chance to record can force the equity partners to put up the
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.040]   money.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.360]   You know, that 44 billion is not all Elon's money.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.000]   Some of it is from Saudi Arabia, Larry Ellison, a variety of equity partners.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.320]   And I don't think they can be compelled to-
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:11.040]   They can easily say, yeah, well, guess what, Elon, we're not giving you the money now.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.520]   So he says in the unlikely event, hopefully unlikely event that Twitter forces this deal
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.080]   to close and some equity partners don't come through.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.700]   It's important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:23.020]   So he's, in other words, he's trying to cash out.
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:27.420]   He also says, and if I win in court, I'll, I'll buy the stock back.
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:33.780]   It could be in the purchase and sale documents too that there's a choice of law and venue
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:39.220]   provision that puts them in this court and has various other restrictions that apply.
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:41.940]   Oh, I'm sure that's in the contract, don't you think?
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:42.940]   Yeah.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:43.940]   Yeah.
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:47.900]   This was, this was a case of Elon saying, I'm going to buy it and Twitter saying, okay,
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.960]   first they took, they said, oh, we're going to know what poison pill.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:54.320]   And then they gave in like three seconds later.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.120]   But I think Twitter basically wrote the most advantageous contract they could.
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:03.680]   Elon basically said, as is sight unseen, I don't care.
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:04.680]   No, no diligence.
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:05.680]   No due diligence.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.640]   Sure.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:10.760]   And so of course Twitter said, yeah, and you're going to be trying to the chance to record.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:15.600]   And not only is there a billion dollar breakup fee, but I think they want the whole amount,
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.600]   right?
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:24.060]   The funny thing is I actually did a segment on the show where I just read the opening
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:26.400]   paragraphs of the Twitter lawyers response.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.700]   Oh, they were so dismissive of Elon.
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:30.700]   It is.
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.300]   They're having so much fun.
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.100]   They're having so much fun.
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:37.040]   Oh my God.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.860]   So he's, I think he's maybe getting some cold feet.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:47.540]   He also maybe said, he's tweeted, if Twitter, all Twitter has to do is give me their method
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:52.100]   of sampling 100 counts and how they're confirmed to be real and the deal can proceed on original
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:53.100]   terms.
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:57.300]   It's like, that's not part of that's not in the deal.
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.540]   They don't have to give him anything.
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:04.860]   And so then the other thing is, is when he started to ask for more stuff to find out
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:07.940]   about these bots, they gave him the whole fire hose.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:09.140]   It's not like they withheld anything.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:14.340]   They're like, okay, we're going to give you every single thing that we have and knowing
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:20.220]   possibly that that's impossible for anyone to actually parse in time.
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:28.660]   But also number two, like they, if his argument is that there are bots and there's more bots
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.820]   than you've told me.
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:32.680]   And so there aren't as many real users as you told me.
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:35.860]   The other problem is is that he's on record publicly saying that the reason he wanted
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:39.140]   to buy Twitter was to solve the bot problem.
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:47.260]   So when you get in the court and you say, I want to get out of this because there's all
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:53.260]   these fake users, he's on stage at Ted telling people that the reason he wants Twitter is
[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.620]   he wants to fix this and make it better.
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:44:03.620]   I hope there's a Perry Mason moment where Twitter's lawyers say, Mr. Busc, you know that your
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:07.260]   lawyers set us your entire phone log for the last 12 years.
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:10.660]   And I don't think that'll happen.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:15.580]   But I'm sure Elon has very, very good lawyers.
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:21.020]   Your guy you had on this week in law a few times, Andrew Torres does a great podcast opening
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.020]   arguments.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:24.140]   I'm sure you're familiar with it.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:27.460]   And I listened to all of their shows about this whole thing.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:31.260]   I think there of the opinion that what this will end up happening is the court will not
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:38.060]   force him to buy Twitter, but will ask for a substantial much more than a billion dollars
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:45.140]   penalty in effect for basically throwing Twitter's business into turmoil.
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:47.660]   Is that possible?
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:51.060]   Yeah, I think that's likely.
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:56.580]   I've always sort of been of the opinion that I'd be surprised if this stayed in court for
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:57.580]   too long.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.580]   Oh, they may settle.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.580]   They're going to get together.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.740]   And we'll never know the terms.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:12.260]   Denise, how common is it for someone to say you signed a contract, I'm going to force
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:13.380]   you to honor this contract.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:19.660]   And I know that it depends on if we're talking about small potatoes things, but huge, huge
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:21.020]   things.
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:27.420]   How often does a court actually say, I don't care, you have a million dollars, you signed
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:28.620]   a contract for a million dollars.
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:30.340]   We're going to pay the million dollars.
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:31.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:37.980]   If this actually goes to trial and they have to perform under the terms of the contract
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:41.740]   and it's proven that they breached the contract, that's what will happen.
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:49.420]   There is a very famous case in Delaware Chansery Court, IBP versus Tyson.
[01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:54.140]   Tyson had, which is the largest chicken processor in America, had agreed to.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:55.580]   Oh, we're talking boxy.
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:01.740]   And agreed to acquire IBP, which is something pork.
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:05.660]   It's the pork meat packing firm.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:09.180]   Very much like Elan agreed to buy Twitter.
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.620]   And then Tyson broke it off.
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:16.540]   IBP filed a breach of contracts suit, much like Twitter has.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:19.860]   And the court ordered Tyson to go through with a purchase.
[01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:22.380]   And that was even, wasn't that around COVID or something?
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:23.380]   So like they could argue.
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:24.380]   No, no.
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:25.380]   Sure.
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:26.380]   No.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.380]   Yeah.
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:32.100]   It was similar in the sense that Tyson said, well, we hadn't seen the financials and now
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:37.740]   that we've seen them, oh, this is terrible.
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:45.220]   And then in fact, the judge said, well, no, you should have known.
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:49.900]   And some of the reason it's terrible is because of you.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:56.700]   So it's not an exact analog and Android tourist does a much better job of explaining it than
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.820]   I do, but it's a fairly famous case.
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:03.480]   And it is the one example where you could say, yeah, the courts can force you to go ahead
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:04.480]   with the purchase.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.480]   They did.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.480]   They made Tyson buy IBP.
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.820]   Denise, what if you don't have the money?
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:12.020]   What if something intervenes in between?
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:17.460]   And we know that Elon has the money because he has all the money, but can a contract be
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:22.740]   avoided at that point because in the intervening time, I don't know, you lost half your whatever?
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:24.700]   No, not at all.
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:31.700]   You'd still get a judgment that the party who the judgment favors can try and enforce.
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:32.700]   However, they can.
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.780]   It doesn't matter if there's no money there.
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:36.940]   They can they can go on a garnish.
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:37.940]   Elon's wages.
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:41.020]   Yeah, they can go on a hunt for other assets.
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:45.700]   That's which may explain why Elon says, I sold all my houses.
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:46.700]   I don't know.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:49.020]   He's living on somebody's couch, apparently.
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:53.420]   Now, for assets is going to be the new rendition of hunt for October.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:58.060]   Like a lot of these guys are like learning.
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:01.780]   You know, it's funny back in the day, Steve was probably one of the most brilliant.
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:06.100]   I'm sure he wasn't alone, but it's the one that we all know about of like setting himself
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:07.660]   up with the dollar salary.
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:11.340]   It's so hard to like get in trouble when you're like, Hey, I just get paid a book, you
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:15.900]   know, and then they'll work around it, of course, and try like you say to go after assets.
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:16.900]   I don't know.
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:20.100]   Elon is just a weird character and it just what makes it worse.
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:25.860]   Like if he was more normal acting, I think more people would maybe side with him, but
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:29.500]   he just does strange things.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.220]   You know, I have such mixed feelings about him because SpaceX is remarkable.
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:35.220]   You and I.
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:36.220]   You and I.
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:37.220]   I had a Tesla.
[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:40.220]   I was really impressed with what Elon had done.
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:45.620]   He didn't kind of remember part of the plan with Tesla was to get rich people to buy the
[01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:52.980]   expensive ones to finance the development of a low cost EV and he had planned to sell
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:55.100]   a model three, I think for 35,000.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:58.700]   You can't get it for less than 46 47 right now.
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:02.660]   So he never kind of lived up to that promise.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:06.940]   But I think still we wouldn't have the electric vehicle market we have today without Elon
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:11.340]   and there is definitely a thing and I don't know what it is.
[01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:17.060]   But again, I hate to keep bringing up severance, but I swear it's on my head right now.
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:24.060]   There's a thing where people who are well intentioned innovators start moving up the
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:30.860]   chain and it's like they get at a very particular point where the billionaire switch comes in
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:33.340]   and they go BS crazy.
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:36.540]   Kanye fits in that description.
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:39.180]   Elon, you know, and that's why there's a whole entire song.
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:46.700]   I really liked the old Kanye because he was always eccentric, but he got super weird once
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:52.460]   he got like dumb rich and Elon did the same similar thing like he was his great guy for
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.460]   a minute.
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:58.420]   And all of a sudden he just hit a level where let me start trying to like buy stuff and
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:02.540]   yeah, a toxic wealth is probably the best explanation of it.
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:13.940]   I don't want to hate on like capitalism or whatever like that because it's not really
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:14.940]   about that.
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.820]   But I just watched Luke.
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:21.340]   I just binge watched it because it's really short and you know, at the end, you know, one
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:26.140]   of the things that she said, which is funny because they're really trying to add in a
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:29.980]   little McKinsey and a little Melinda into this character.
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:34.580]   And she says billionaire shouldn't exist like I can see.
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:37.420]   Yeah, it was a well stated point.
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:41.460]   And then right after she went back to doing something billionaire oriented, which was,
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:46.860]   you know, they all say that and they all act like they're being altruistic.
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:51.420]   But most of their altruism is feeding egos and she had to read.
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:52.860]   Side confuses me.
[01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:57.620]   The only thing I really might I mean, I know stuff about legal stuff, but my favorite term
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:59.900]   is frolic and detour and I don't get to use that.
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:00.900]   Frolic in detour.
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:03.260]   Yeah, that's my favorite legal term.
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:04.260]   What does that mean?
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:07.580]   Do you know that when you're working for a company, you stop acting like an employee
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:08.820]   to do your own thing?
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:09.820]   I'm frolicking.
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:10.820]   Oh yeah.
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:12.660]   We have many frolic and detours around here.
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:15.660]   That's a very, very popular one.
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:17.900]   I knew one on me.
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:18.900]   Okay.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:22.140]   Clearly, I don't know what I learned from one of my lawyer friends and I thought it was
[01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:24.180]   the best thing I ever learned.
[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:29.060]   We need the incentive of possibly becoming a billionaire to get people to create to
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:31.820]   innovate, to make build companies.
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:33.580]   Is that a necessary incentive?
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:37.140]   Because that would be the argument for allowing, I mean, for having billionaires.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:39.780]   And I get that's why that works.
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:45.700]   But what happens is imagine, okay, so granted there's boards and there's other things in
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:52.180]   place, but someone like a single person, especially a person who has shown that there
[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:59.060]   might be something, you know, ants not at the full picnic to get over to a platform that
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:01.900]   controls that many people's communication.
[01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:03.420]   That's a scary thought.
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:08.660]   And I think anybody with that much power does get a little, you know, punch drunk.
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:14.860]   And so they're probably no longer good to single handedly, you know, control a body of
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:15.860]   people.
[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:19.220]   It almost it almost stands the reason like, how is it that, you know, four or five hundred
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:23.700]   people are in charge of, you know, 390 million of us.
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.340]   It's a, it's a really weird situation.
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:27.340]   I don't know.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.340]   I think it's time to rethink this.
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:33.620]   So let me just clarify the frolic and detour and chancery courts are about of the same
[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:34.620]   vintage.
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:35.620]   1800s.
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:36.620]   1800s, baby.
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:37.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:46.300]   And the phrase originated in Joel versus Morris and an English case from the 1800s was clarified.
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:51.660]   We're ready for this that a master is liable for actions a servant takes stemming from
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:58.020]   a master servant relationship where a servant takes a detour while acting in the scope of
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:03.900]   employment, but is not liable where a servant goes on a frolic of his own that exceeds the
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.060]   scope of employment.
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:09.540]   By the way, there's a great novel called a frolic of his own, but that's now I know
[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:11.180]   where that term comes from.
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:13.620]   I had no idea at the time.
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:17.260]   I'm frolic and on my own here.
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:19.940]   If anyone's interested.
[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:22.780]   Yeah, no doubt frolic and detour.
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:24.980]   William Gaddis is one of my favorite authors.
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:26.020]   I don't know how well known he is.
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:27.500]   He wrote a book called JR.
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:28.660]   That's hysterical.
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:32.420]   But then he had a subsequent book called a frolic of his own.
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:38.540]   And obviously he knew all about frolic and detour.
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:43.340]   And the dell, the Delaware chancery court has thoughtfully provided what they call
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:50.380]   a short history of the court of chancery that is a really, really long explanation of
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:52.940]   the history of that court since 1792.
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:59.100]   And it goes back to two equity courts in Jolly Old England has a lot of our juris.
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:02.660]   So common law, baby, it all goes down a common law at some point.
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:04.820]   And they're the competition for common law.
[01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:07.820]   So the thing that I just discovered while you guys are talking about this and they made
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:09.060]   me think about it.
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:14.900]   Now I know why here our community college system, they're all based on chancellors and the stuff
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:20.300]   that they do to come up with policies or check policies is actually a chance.
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:24.020]   If you ever go, I know this because my dad was a professor at Brown University.
[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:29.940]   If you ever go to a graduation at one of the old schools and you see the crazy gowns that
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:35.100]   the professors wear with the floppy hats and the velvet and all this, you realize it's
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:37.020]   completely a medieval institution.
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:42.660]   It's just straight out of the 15th century.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:47.880]   Before we leave Elon, can I toss out my own conspiracy theory as to why he may have sold
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.060]   out all this stuff?
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:58.780]   Maybe it's so that he can dim Starlink down so that it does not disturb astronomers and
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:00.220]   the global population.
[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:02.020]   Have you guys seen Starlink yet?
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:03.020]   Oh yeah.
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:04.020]   The satellite array?
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:12.220]   Yeah, maybe last year my trainer says, "Oh, you won't believe what I saw in the sky last
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:13.220]   night.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:14.220]   I'm sure it's a UFO."
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:18.340]   He showed me a video of 20 lights in a line going through the sky.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.820]   I said, "That's Starlink."
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:21.420]   Oh my God.
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:27.340]   I saw it for the first time and this will forever be the summer that I saw Starlink in the Wyoming
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:28.340]   sky.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:33.940]   It does look like a UFO, doesn't it?
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:34.940]   Look at this.
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:38.900]   Oh, it's insane when you see it and you don't know what it is.
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:43.700]   So when they first launched the satellites, they launched how many on a rocket, John,
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:46.980]   is 20 or 60, I think it is, on a rocket.
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:53.340]   They launched those and then their information coming off of the rocket and then they deploy
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:54.500]   to their locations.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:59.580]   But when you first see them, before their deployment to their various locations, it's
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:04.860]   just a line of satellites that have just come off the rocket.
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.540]   It looks like an un-
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:07.540]   It's not sandy-clothes.
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:09.500]   It's not sandy-clothes.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:10.900]   You can see what my trainer thought.
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:13.380]   I saw a UFO for sure.
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.180]   I mean, what is this?
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:22.460]   It looks like an unwound DNA helix when you see it in the sky.
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:25.020]   If you're watching the video, Leo's got it up.
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:27.700]   It's clearly not natural.
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:34.820]   So you might grab your kids, your dog and your spouse and go underground because the
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.540]   aliens have arrived.
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:41.500]   This is a 4K video from Viral Video Lab on YouTube.
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:44.500]   I found it just by searching for a Starlink deployment.
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:46.860]   But yeah, that's pretty striking.
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:47.860]   So you saw that?
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:48.860]   You saw that?
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:49.860]   You saw that?
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:50.860]   People thought it was UFOs.
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:51.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:57:01.180]   The next day after I saw it, the news story that I saw because we were in the western United
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:06.100]   States and apparently hundreds of people in the Salt Lake City area called 911 saying
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:10.260]   what the hell is going on.
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:15.540]   But again, this is an amazing thing that SpaceX is doing.
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:18.060]   I mean, it's mind-boggling.
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:22.340]   When I get, I was all excited for a long time about Starlink because it's in theory going
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:26.420]   to bring high-speed internet access to every corner of the world.
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:31.260]   And then you find out, oh yeah, but first you have to spend $600 on a satellite dish
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:33.740]   and then it's going to be $110 a month.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:39.740]   This is not some egalitarian effort to provide internet for everybody.
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:42.140]   This is a rich man's internet.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:45.940]   Oh, yes, coupled with remote, right?
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:48.860]   Like I don't think just anybody can get this internet.
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:50.340]   I think you have to be...
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:53.900]   Well, just anybody can get it, but you wouldn't unless you were way out there.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:54.900]   You had to.
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:57.140]   You're the only one because you had to.
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:58.140]   It's like Iridium.
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:04.340]   We talked, our host from this week in space, Rod Pyle is up in the Arctic about 15 degrees
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:08.460]   south of the North Pole because NASA goes up there because it's the closest thing on
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:09.460]   Earth to Mars.
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:10.460]   So they test their rovers.
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:12.020]   He's up there with them.
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:15.900]   And he calls, it's called the radio show today, if I Iridium's satellite phone.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.780]   It's a perfect example.
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:20.540]   You might say, oh wow, Iridium, they're going to...
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:22.220]   It's 60 satellites.
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:24.660]   It's going to give phone access to every corner of the globe.
[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.660]   Yeah.
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:26.660]   If you've got...
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:27.660]   What was it?
[01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:31.860]   I think he said it was like a hundred bucks a megabyte or something.
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:36.020]   I mean, if you have a huge amount of money, this is great.
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:37.540]   Starlink is not designed.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:41.980]   Maybe down the road, the plan is, oh, and we'll subsidize low cost.
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.140]   Internet access for the third world.
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:49.020]   To their credit, they've done some good work in Ukraine.
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:50.020]   Absolutely.
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:56.020]   And firefighters in the US and the earthquake survivors, I think, was in Haiti.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:57.020]   So yes.
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:59:02.300]   So the place I was staying, when I saw Starlink, was actually a customer.
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:04.620]   And I think they're in their beta program.
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:07.260]   So I think they probably get a break on the price.
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:09.900]   For some reason, I got a hundred bucks.
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:12.220]   I got my Starlink deposit back.
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.140]   I didn't ask for it back, but I gave it back to me.
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:18.820]   I think that was maybe Elon's message that you're never getting Starlink, buddy.
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:21.180]   Yeah, probably so.
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:23.300]   You dream on, buddy.
[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:27.500]   So now the Elon and Tim get together and talk about not inviting you to stay.
[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:28.820]   I can't go to Apple events.
[01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:30.820]   I can't get Elon's Starlink.
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:31.820]   I wanted it.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:35.860]   I thought because imagine if you had a little box you could carry around with you wherever
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:39.740]   you were and you could do these shows from anywhere you were.
[01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:42.020]   And that was to me, that was again the promise of that.
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:43.820]   And I'd be willing to pay a hundred ten bucks a month for that.
[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:45.620]   I got one of those boxes right here.
[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:46.620]   You have a Starlink?
[01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:48.740]   No, no, I have the Yolo box.
[01:59:48.740 --> 01:59:50.740]   I just slap in my mint mobile chip when I need it.
[01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:51.740]   Oh, there you go.
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:53.460]   Maybe that's what I should do.
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:57.580]   The place I was staying actually had Starlink as their internet provider.
[01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:58.580]   How was it?
[01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:04.100]   My son and I ran into the proprietor's panic at night going, we're being invaded and they
[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:05.820]   said, no, that's our internet.
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:06.820]   That's our provider.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:07.820]   Wow.
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:08.820]   That's right.
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:09.820]   Yeah.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:11.900]   And it was good.
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:15.660]   I was able to FaceTime my mom from the middle of nowhere and it was great quality.
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:19.300]   So, I mean, they had a dish, not a box.
[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:21.460]   They had a dish that looked like a direct TV dish.
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:23.180]   Yeah, it's a little box.
[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:24.180]   My, the...
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:26.500]   I meant that the box would hold the dish.
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.980]   Yeah, it's a dish.
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:28.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:34.340]   They do, they have a beach house somewhere in Mass, I think, Salisbury-ish and they use
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:38.700]   the Starlink to do the live stream to the E-cam community once a month to tell them
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.300]   like what they're working on.
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:41.620]   And it works amazingly.
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:46.660]   I was originally worried that it would crap out in the middle of the show, but it seems
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:47.660]   to work.
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:51.940]   And I have another customer that's in England in like a giant sheep farm and he uses it.
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:52.940]   It's pretty flawless.
[02:00:52.940 --> 02:00:56.300]   I guess this would be the point of the show where we do mention that Starlink ground stations
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:05.100]   have been successfully hacked with a $25 box that you could buy.
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:06.860]   What does that mean?
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:10.940]   Belgian, anybody, anybody can get Starlink if they do the hack?
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:12.260]   I don't, let me read it.
[02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:14.220]   This, you know, we're going to see a lot of these stories.
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:17.980]   In fact, I have a ton of them today from Black Hat, Defcon.
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:21.020]   This is the time of year where all of a sudden you find out everything you know has been
[02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:22.020]   hacked.
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:25.940]   Belgian security researcher Leonard Vutors, who is very well known, has gotten his own
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:30.020]   code running on the dishy Mcdish face satellite terminals.
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:32.700]   And you can too.
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:35.540]   The hack is the dishy Mcdish face.
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:38.020]   That's what they call them.
[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:42.460]   It's a mod chip with an RP2040 and a MOSFET that crowbars the power rails.
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:44.780]   So you know, anybody could do this.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:49.420]   Browning out the main CPU exactly when it's verifying the firmware's validity bypassing
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:50.420]   that protection.
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:53.500]   Oh, that's clever entirely.
[02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:56.660]   Leonard had previously figured out how to dump the Starlink firmware direct from the
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:02:00.180]   EMMC and then uploaded back.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:03.740]   So now the circle of ownership is closed.
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:07.420]   There was a talk at Defcon, of course.
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:09.700]   About $25 in parts.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:14.700]   Leonard has submitted his attack to Starlink and he says they took some precautions to
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:17.220]   make the glitching harder.
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:20.300]   But it's not like they can't really disable it.
[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:25.660]   It's almost impossible to shield the device against an attacker who has it on the bench.
[02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:30.620]   So yeah, you can't just go around and drive around town and hack people's Starlink.
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:33.820]   You know, you got to get access to it.
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:38.340]   Elon's in a little bit more trouble with the California Department of Motor Vehicles.
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:47.500]   They are accusing Tesla of deceptive practices in marketing autopilot and full self-driving.
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:54.620]   The penalties could be as bad as losing the ability to sell Teslas in California.
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:58.540]   Tesla has not yet, as far as I know, responded to these allegations.
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:04.020]   I think they were supposed to by Friday, but I haven't seen the story that they have.
[02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:07.380]   So I don't know what the upshot of this is.
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:12.700]   Maybe they're going to put an asterisk next to autopilot and full self-driving.
[02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:16.580]   Maybe they'll ask them to change the name.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:21.740]   I think I agree with them that saying it's full self-driving or calling it autopilot is
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:22.740]   risky.
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:28.220]   It gives some people the feeling that they can get in the backseat and take a nap, which
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:32.940]   they cannot.
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:33.940]   Nothing to say here.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:34.940]   Move along.
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:38.020]   No, I'm just thinking that the self-driving thing just scares me.
[02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:40.020]   I've always thought it'd be cool.
[02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:43.740]   One of the things we were talking about, you know, studying abroad, when I lived in Japan,
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:48.260]   I lived in Tokyo City proper, but I went to school just outside in the country.
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:51.300]   So I had like an hour and a half everyday train ride.
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:56.180]   And the one dope part about high-speed rail is I spent all that time doing work.
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:04:00.340]   Like I would actually do my homework instead because that would be part of the airport.
[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:01.340]   Isn't that awesome?
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:02.340]   And it's awesome.
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:03.340]   Yeah, you're on a train.
[02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:04.340]   You don't have to drive.
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:05.340]   Yes.
[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:06.340]   I love that.
[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:07.340]   I've been in Cali when I was at Apple.
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:08.340]   I rode Caltrain many a times.
[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:09.340]   You can have Cal do stuff.
[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:10.340]   Love it.
[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:14.740]   I wish we would get to that point, but the self-driving thing was supposed to be like a
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:17.180]   stopgap, but it's just too scary.
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:22.100]   The only thing I wanted to do in self-driving is invent something so that I can code name
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:26.820]   my project, Jesus, Take the Wheel.
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:29.060]   You mentioned how much you love severance.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:31.300]   Did you go to Comic-Con?
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:32.300]   San Diego Comic-Con?
[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:34.740]   No, I saw that panel.
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:37.340]   Apple TV, well, they built a set.
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:39.020]   One of the things Apple's done really well.
[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:46.380]   This is from Justin.costplay on YouTube is build physical sets that people can participate
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:47.380]   in.
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:48.700]   There you are in the boardroom at severance.
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:52.620]   I'm sure there's a speaker that says wake up.
[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:56.660]   I think you can actually wander around.
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:58.620]   There's the psychotherapy unit.
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:00.460]   Oh, that is so cool.
[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:04.140]   We need a love to wander around in this.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:08.420]   Dude, your next idea for a wall is send us pictures of your mouse and let's build a
[02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:09.420]   twit mouth wall.
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:11.420]   Oh, love it.
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:12.740]   I want to buy one on his computer.
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:16.260]   So my own Etsy, you figured that bad boy out, I would buy one.
[02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:19.540]   So the story is that producers, they wanted to make it realistic.
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:21.060]   These are real computers.
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:25.180]   They used old computer parts to assemble something that looks kind of like a Lisa.
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:28.700]   I mean, it definitely looks vintage, but it actually is a real computer.
[02:05:28.700 --> 02:05:32.500]   It can actually do the thing they do on the show.
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:34.620]   Oh, Lord.
[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:36.220]   Welcome to your pod.
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:40.060]   Man, you're not buff enough to be millet chick.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:45.220]   Is the baby Luco on the desk in homage to, you know, Pixar game?
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.220]   You're going to have to explain.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:47.820]   Oh, the Luxo lamp here?
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:50.780]   You think that that is a Pixar Luxo lamp?
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:51.780]   Maybe.
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:53.220]   Maybe that's a good question.
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:56.180]   Anyway, I wish I had gone to Comic Con because this would have been fun.
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:06:01.740]   Dude, I love the fact that, you know, Dylan has his character's pin to his desk.
[02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:02.740]   Yeah.
[02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:03.740]   Yeah, that's pretty funny.
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:04.740]   Yeah.
[02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:05.740]   So great.
[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:10.060]   You know, I'm a stam, a severance stam, not just a...
[02:06:10.060 --> 02:06:11.380]   You know what it is for me?
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:14.500]   Any person, and this has been still the mind of binstiller.
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:15.580]   So bring it.
[02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:18.740]   And I love it when there's these guys that we grew up with that everybody has thought
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:22.020]   they were just these random comedians and kind of goofy.
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:27.140]   And you look at the creativity that's in the Jim Carrey or the binstiller that goes far
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:33.660]   deeper than just them being a slapstick comedy person, the small stuff that they put in that
[02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:38.100]   connects it all together is so brilliant.
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:40.580]   Stiller did say something interesting at that Comic Con panel.
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:45.860]   He said, "We don't get viewer information from Apple."
[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:48.060]   And I thought, "This could be problematic for Apple."
[02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:54.020]   You know, people who produce shows often want to know how many people watch.
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:55.380]   They're one person, a hundred thousand.
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:57.820]   But Apple doesn't get it from Netflix either.
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:06:59.180]   No streamer does.
[02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:02.860]   Except I don't buy that.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:03.860]   Apple knows, right?
[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:04.860]   Netflix knows.
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.180]   They've got to have...
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:11.340]   They've got to be saying, "Look, you can't admit that you know this, but..."
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:13.220]   Oh, I'm just going to...
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:15.020]   Right?
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:25.300]   It's a different Hollywood where because everything's internal, like why give up that leverage,
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:26.300]   right?
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:27.300]   So the only way that you know...
[02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:28.300]   Get but a producer reasonably...
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:29.300]   Needs binstiller.
[02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:30.300]   A hundred percent.
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:34.300]   He wants to know how many people watch me on that.
[02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:36.060]   Not only that, but think of Leo.
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:39.620]   If you as a producer knew, well, this was our most popular episode.
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:42.740]   This is what people really connected to this character.
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:49.020]   If you're in a black box, it's harder to respond to how the audience is responding to you.
[02:07:49.020 --> 02:07:50.020]   Right.
[02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:51.740]   Here's the different side of it though.
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:55.100]   Let me be doc advocate for a second.
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:58.180]   If you look at YouTube, I'm guessing I'm the content creator, right?
[02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:00.980]   If you look at it with the content creators, we're telling you, we're telling you.
[02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:03.500]   You don't have to get the exact numbers from it.
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:05.620]   Just watch us, we tell you.
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:12.700]   And I think 14 Emmys kind of gives you a good idea how you're doing playing.
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:13.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:14.940]   I guess.
[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:15.940]   I mean...
[02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:20.980]   Look, so if you're a content creator, if you're a binstiller or a Martin Scorsese, you
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:22.500]   have a lot of choices now.
[02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:27.420]   People throwing money at you saying, "Please produce something for our streaming channel."
[02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:29.200]   And then, so among...
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:32.180]   It's not just money, I'm sure.
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:36.720]   It's also, "Oh, we can give you prestige, or we'll push you for nominations for Oscars
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:39.220]   or Emmys."
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:44.180]   But I think a missing point of it that the networks, the television networks can offer
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:48.020]   is, "We'll tell you how many people saw this episode."
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.820]   That's all.
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:51.140]   Here's a problem that I fight with.
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:54.740]   And I think you will understand this because you do this as a business.
[02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:59.260]   My thing is trying to teach my creators, do not get sucked into staring at the analytics
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:02.660]   and start making knee-jerk reactions based off the analytics.
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:06.140]   Your only true algorithm is your actual audience.
[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:08.580]   So pay attention to your audience.
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:10.500]   Listen to what they're telling you.
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:15.380]   When YouTube starts to show you these weird blips in your ad revenue because companies
[02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:19.700]   stop spending during July because they know everybody's on vacation, don't freak out
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:22.700]   and think that means that your content isn't being hit.
[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:28.740]   So the problem with algorithms is you make false adjustments and in turn do stupid things
[02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:30.620]   that alienate your audience.
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:34.620]   But if you listen to your audience, they will always guide you in the direction that they
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:35.820]   want you to go.
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:38.900]   So I try to tell people to stop staring at the algorithms.
[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:43.420]   And so, yeah, somebody mentioned that awards don't equal viewers, but pay attention to
[02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:45.500]   what the viewers are actually telling you.
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:51.260]   Listen to the podcast, setting up Q&As that can be live streamed on Twitter, YouTube,
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:55.300]   whatever with your audience doing a show like this where you have your whole audience in
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.300]   the chat telling you what to do.
[02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:58.300]   You're not raw.
[02:09:58.300 --> 02:09:59.260]   That's way more valuable than numbers.
[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:00.420]   But that's way more valuable than numbers.
[02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:04.380]   That's how YouTube and podcasts are different than broadcast television.
[02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:05.380]   Correct.
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:06.380]   Right.
[02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:07.380]   Broadcasters have no eye.
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:08.380]   They don't have a two-waste.
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:14.420]   I remember some years ago, before he passed, it was actually, he had just announced he was
[02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:15.420]   retiring.
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:18.220]   I taught, reached Philbin on how to tweet on how to Twitter.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:20.420]   There's actually a YouTube video of it.
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:24.340]   And so he tweeted, I just announced my retirement today on the show.
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:26.180]   And he started getting all these responses back.
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:32.180]   And he was so excited because here's a guy who had been 50 years in broadcasting.
[02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:34.860]   He never got that kind of feedback.
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:35.860]   He called his wife.
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:37.860]   He said, "Joy, Joy, go look on Twitter.
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:39.740]   They're talking to me."
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:47.860]   By the way, he quit Twitter within a week because he couldn't handle it.
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:51.060]   These guys are not used to that feedback, but I got to tell you, if you're a television
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:53.820]   producer, you want to know, "Well, how many people watched Show 1?
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:55.460]   How many people watched Show 10?
[02:10:55.460 --> 02:10:56.460]   Did it go up?
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:57.460]   Did it go down?"
[02:10:57.460 --> 02:10:58.460]   That's valuable information.
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:06.020]   And Apple, I cannot believe that Apple is not telling Ben Stiller how Severance is doing.
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:09.620]   He says, "They give us charts with no zero.
[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:10.620]   What's up?
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:11.620]   It's down.
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:12.620]   They don't give us the numbers."
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:14.300]   That's very appily.
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:17.580]   I think that's in the long run, that's not going to work for Apple.
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:21.340]   Producers want to know, "How many people saw this show?"
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:22.340]   I really do.
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:23.820]   But I might be wrong.
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:24.820]   Maybe not.
[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:26.700]   All right, we're going to take a quick break.
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:28.340]   I've kept you so long.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:29.980]   I've got a couple more things to do.
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:33.500]   I do want to talk about some of the silliest things that happened this week, but first
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:38.020]   a word from a great sponsor, "click up."
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:43.540]   Imagine if you could get an extra day every week, instead of five-day work week, four
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:44.540]   days.
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:46.460]   What would that be worth to you?
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:49.980]   What would you do with a binge severance?
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:53.420]   I mean, I know that's what Doc would do.
[02:11:53.420 --> 02:11:59.340]   Cook healthy meals, work out more, write a novel you could take advantage of that extra
[02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:00.340]   day a week.
[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:04.620]   Well, that's what ClickUp gives you, the productivity platform that is so effective,
[02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:12.740]   it will save you one day of work a week, one day of work a week, and that's guaranteed.
[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:16.300]   I know you don't believe me, but it's guaranteed.
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:20.780]   ClickUp was started because they realized productivity was broken.
[02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:23.940]   There were too many tools to keep track of, too many things.
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:28.740]   All the ecosystems were siloed, separate, didn't talk to one another, one another.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:32.060]   They knew there had to be a better way to get through the daily hustle, so they created
[02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:33.060]   ClickUp.
[02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:39.420]   The one tool, I love it when a startup scratches their own itch.
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:42.020]   They've solved their own problem, and that's why it works so well.
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:46.500]   That's the one tool that houses all your tasks, your projects, your docs, your goals, your
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:52.300]   spreadsheets, your more built for teams from a single person, ClickUp will help you to 1,000
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:53.620]   plus people.
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:58.700]   It's packed with features and customization options that no other productivity tool has
[02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:02.660]   so you can tailor it to work exactly how you do.
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:07.980]   Whether you're in project management or engineering or sales or marketing or HR, ClickUp has
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:11.460]   easy use solutions that create a more efficient work environment.
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:14.260]   I think that's a nice balancing act.
[02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:19.700]   Yes, it's highly customizable, but from day one, you'll get started with a setup that
[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:24.100]   is tuned for the kind of work you do and then you can refine it if you want.
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:25.100]   This explains a lot.
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:28.860]   800,000 highly productive teams are using ClickUp.
[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:29.860]   800,000.
[02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:32.460]   That's huge success.

[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:13.980]   I'm excited about this.
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:14.980]   I may be the only one.
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:18.140]   You were talking about how the kids today like the old music.
[02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:19.700]   I like the old games.
[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:21.140]   Did you ever hear of?
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:22.140]   You're probably not old enough.
[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:23.140]   Did you?
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:24.140]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:25.140]   Oh, yes.
[02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:26.140]   Oh, yes.
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:27.140]   I lived it.
[02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:28.900]   First thing I never bought was my first computer.
[02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:30.420]   You know what I'm talking about?
[02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:31.420]   100%.
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:32.420]   I was waiting for this.
[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:36.020]   And we were talking about this on a live stream like a month ago.
[02:14:36.020 --> 02:14:41.020]   And the fact that this is coming real now, when I saw the story blew my mind, I'm like
[02:14:41.020 --> 02:14:42.020]   backflips.
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:44.540]   Ditto, ditto.
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:47.260]   I can't believe you're talking about the same story I am.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:48.820]   100% King Quest.
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:50.220]   Ken and Roberta are back.
[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:51.220]   You are.
[02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:52.220]   You are.
[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:53.220]   You are.
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:54.220]   But it's not King's Quest.
[02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:59.540]   So, Ken and Roberta Williams, they sold Sierra online, but they brought you King's Quest
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:01.180]   and Space Quest at Quest for Glory.
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:04.100]   They were the original graphic adventures, remember?
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:07.780]   And in the old days, before graphic adventures, there were text adventures.
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:13.940]   You might remember if you're old, Zork and, you know, or Planet Fall and those info-com
[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:14.940]   adventures.
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:20.820]   But even before that, I used to play it on a dial-up modem.
[02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:25.340]   Dialing into CompuServe, there was a game by Will Crowther and Don Woods called Colossal
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:27.220]   Cave Adventure.
[02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:32.420]   And this was the first text adventure, an amazing adventure game.
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:34.180]   I loved it.
[02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:44.100]   So Ken and Roberta have got together and they've made a graphic version of Colossal Cave.
[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:46.940]   Get your plug and your XYZZY ready.
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:49.860]   This is very exciting.
[02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:52.100]   This was a great game.
[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:54.900]   It's more than 50 years old.
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:57.820]   You can still play if you search for Colossal Cave online.
[02:15:57.820 --> 02:16:00.500]   There's, you know, simulators online.
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:02.340]   You can apparently do it in VR.
[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:04.420]   They're reporting it to the Quest.
[02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:08.420]   Oh, I may actually have to get a Quest just to do this.
[02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:12.620]   This comes from the Geeks Guide to the Galaxy podcast.
[02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:17.420]   So I should give them credit because they got Ken and Roberta on and then they got them
[02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:20.420]   to tell us about this.
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:21.420]   Here it comes.
[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:22.620]   Now, did they say when they're...
[02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:25.420]   I can't believe you guys remember Colossal Cave.
[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:26.740]   I'm stunned.
[02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:27.740]   But it's also...
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:29.260]   I remember King's Quest.
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.260]   King's Quest for sure.
[02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:31.260]   King's Quest.
[02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:37.660]   But Leo, this is also like, I don't know, a famous movie director, an auteur coming back
[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:40.180]   after not making a movie for 25 years.
[02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:41.540]   That's also the big story.
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:42.540]   That's also the story.
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:44.140]   Ken and Roberta coming back.
[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:45.140]   Yeah.
[02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:48.420]   So Colossal Cave was released in 1976.
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:53.340]   Ken and Roberta assembled a team of almost 30 artists and programmers to do a graphical
[02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:57.300]   version of this classic text adventure.
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:00.900]   Roberta on the podcast said, "None of them really knew what Colossal Cave was."
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:02.500]   Yeah, 1976.
[02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:03.900]   They weren't even born.
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:04.980]   We've had to educate them.
[02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:09.380]   All I have to say, she said, is that as we've worked with them on this game in various ways,
[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:13.180]   programmers, animators, artists, they've come to have such respect for this game.
[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:16.480]   And I've been told many times I had no idea this game was this good and this interesting
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:18.500]   and this deep and complex.
[02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:20.740]   I am the same age as Ken and Roberta.
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:23.100]   I am so thrilled that they are bringing this back.
[02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:30.100]   That is exciting.
[02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:33.700]   Episode 523 of Geeks Guide to the Galaxy.
[02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:39.020]   If you want to hear the full interview, it's Wired Magazine's gaming podcast.
[02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:41.300]   I think this is such good news.
[02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:45.220]   I'm so glad I'm thrilled that you guys are excited about this.
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:47.220]   Oh man, this is so good.
[02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:48.220]   Did you play King's Quest?
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:49.220]   Is that why?
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:50.220]   Well, no, actually, I think my first one was Mystery House or Mystery Science Theater, whatever
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:51.220]   heck it was called.
[02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:55.220]   Yes, and of course, the other one that I was just telling my group that we're talking
[02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:59.220]   about this is I would love for Allo to bring back.
[02:17:59.220 --> 02:18:01.220]   Leisure Suit Leo.
[02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:02.220]   Leisure Suit Leo.
[02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:03.220]   Oh my God.
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:04.220]   Oh my God.
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:05.220]   Leisure Suit Leo.
[02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:06.220]   Oh please.
[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:11.220]   Oh my God, it would ruin my reputation, which is already wrong.
[02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:12.220]   It was so good.
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:14.220]   I interviewed Allo many years ago.
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:17.220]   I don't like that I'm doing something wrong.
[02:18:17.220 --> 02:18:18.220]   What a character.
[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:19.220]   Allo.
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:20.220]   It was so great.
[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:25.340]   So the Leisure Suit Larry games were the first games that as kids we got pirated versions
[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:26.900]   of because they were sexy.
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:27.900]   Yeah.
[02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:33.300]   And then number two, the hundreds and hundreds of dollars that then my parents discovered
[02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:40.460]   when I called in for the King's Quest and Space Quest tip lines, the 1,900 numbers so
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:41.740]   that we could beat the game.
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:47.260]   And then a month later, my dad sits me down and says, "Why is there a $400 charge on my
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:48.260]   phone bill?"
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:49.260]   Oh Lord.
[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:50.260]   Oh.
[02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:55.260]   $400 and 88 was a lot of money.
[02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:56.260]   I bet.
[02:18:56.260 --> 02:18:57.260]   And it was 88.
[02:18:57.260 --> 02:18:58.260]   You're right.
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:18:59.260]   I bet you.
[02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:00.260]   That's what people don't.
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:04.700]   Now it's just all the kids who are making unauthorized in-app purchases in their piece.
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:08.260]   There was no Reddit to explain or YouTube to give us walkthroughs.
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:09.260]   Yeah.
[02:19:09.260 --> 02:19:10.260]   All right.
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:18.580]   Get ready kids because Internet Archive has Leisure Suit Larry on their emulator.
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:20.580]   You can play it from 1987.
[02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:23.140]   Let's see if I'm right.
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:24.140]   Let's see if I'm right.
[02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:28.060]   This starts in a hot tub, right?
[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:34.020]   This was the filthiest game in such a stupid way.
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:35.020]   I don't know.
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:36.420]   Oh, here we go.
[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:37.420]   Programming by Allo.
[02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:40.020]   I don't know if the keyboards.
[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:41.820]   I don't know what.
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:42.820]   It's so annoying.
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:46.100]   The credits are great.
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.100]   I need that ringtone.
[02:19:48.100 --> 02:19:51.660]   Just to find the old people around me.
[02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:55.420]   This was a Sierra online game.
[02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:58.060]   Oh my God.
[02:19:58.060 --> 02:20:03.020]   By the way, $400 in 1988 would be $1,001.78 today.
[02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:06.500]   I had a lot of things taken away from you.
[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:10.220]   Thank you to Jason Hall, our producer for that.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:12.820]   Jason looked it up.
[02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:14.980]   Cameo coding by Ken Williams.
[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:17.820]   There you go.
[02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:19.460]   OK, let's see the game.
[02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:21.020]   Will there be a hot tub?
[02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:22.020]   Oh, come on.
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:24.620]   Is this going to just play the attracts thing forever?
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:25.620]   It is.
[02:20:25.620 --> 02:20:26.620]   Come on.
[02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:28.340]   How do I get the game going?
[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:32.340]   Oh, there's apparently something I don't know.
[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:35.260]   I don't know how to do.
[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:36.740]   Maybe some button.
[02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:37.740]   Oh, warning.
[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:38.740]   There you are.
[02:20:38.740 --> 02:20:39.740]   Warning.
[02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:40.740]   Yeah, I hit the right button.
[02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:44.060]   Leisure Suit Larry in the land of the lounge lizards contains some elements of plot which
[02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:47.380]   may not be considered appropriate for some children.
[02:20:47.380 --> 02:20:48.380]   How old am I?
[02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:51.380]   6, 3, 4, 10 year olds apparently.
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:52.380]   There are a few questions.
[02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:59.300]   To verify that you're really 65, please answer five simple questions.
[02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:00.300]   I remember these.
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:02.300]   Who's buried in Gratomb?
[02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:09.060]   Grant Tinker Land Grant NSF Grant Mrs. Grant.
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:11.900]   These are nonsense, but I'm going to answer them anyway, correct.
[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:17.220]   If a physician were stranded on a desert island with Bo Derek, does anybody know what
[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:18.420]   is anybody remember Bo Derek?
[02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:22.620]   He would probably build a boat, take two aspirants overcharge her.
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:23.620]   Thank God.
[02:21:23.620 --> 02:21:24.620]   D.
[02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:25.620]   D.
[02:21:25.620 --> 02:21:26.620]   Correct.
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:31.740]   The first lady to culturally appropriate braids, which is not an American armed force.
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:36.020]   The Army, the Navy, the National Guard, or the National League, D seems to be the answer
[02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:37.300]   everywhere here.
[02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:41.980]   Lee Harvey Oswald killed Harvey Milk, Charles Nelson Riley, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, or
[02:21:41.980 --> 02:21:43.780]   William Randolph Hearst.
[02:21:43.780 --> 02:21:44.780]   Okay.
[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:45.860]   There's nothing to laugh about there.
[02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:46.860]   So far, so good.
[02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:47.860]   Now for the final question.
[02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:51.140]   Bourbon Street is in Whiskyville, Indiana.
[02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:53.820]   Jackass Flats, Idaho, Monopoly.
[02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:54.820]   New Orleans.
[02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:58.220]   I think I know the answer to that.
[02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:01.580]   I was credit for as a 10 year old passing these.
[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:03.380]   You got through these.
[02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:07.460]   So the idea was if you were a kid, you wouldn't be able to get through those with no ability
[02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:09.220]   to look it up on Google yet either.
[02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:10.700]   I'm going to say it wasn't important.
[02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:12.060]   No, it does not begin on.
[02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:13.060]   Not a hot tub.
[02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:15.900]   It begins in lefties.
[02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:16.900]   I don't know how to.
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:17.900]   Oh, there we go.
[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:18.900]   Here we go.
[02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:22.340]   I'm going into lefties bar and grill.
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:23.340]   Enter.
[02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:24.340]   How can you do that?
[02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:25.340]   Open door?
[02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:27.980]   I don't know.
[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:30.060]   Open door.
[02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:31.420]   Okay.
[02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:37.900]   So this is actually a text adventure with really crappy graphics, by the way.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:40.100]   Sit at bar.
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:41.100]   Do you get?
[02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:42.900]   There's no time.
[02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:44.340]   There's no time.
[02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:45.340]   Sit down?
[02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:46.340]   Just say sit down.
[02:22:46.340 --> 02:22:48.180]   Yeah, you're not close enough.
[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:52.020]   Walk to bar to bar.
[02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:53.020]   Just walk there.
[02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:54.020]   Okay.
[02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:55.020]   Walk.
[02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:56.020]   You play this game.
[02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:57.020]   I know.
[02:22:57.020 --> 02:22:58.020]   I'm telling you.
[02:22:58.020 --> 02:22:59.020]   Just walk.
[02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:00.020]   Just walk.
[02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:01.020]   Use the arrows.
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:02.020]   Use the arrow keys.
[02:23:02.020 --> 02:23:04.860]   Things like things like the poster in the wall when you're a kid like and when I'm doing
[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:05.860]   this, I think I'm like, sexy.
[02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:06.860]   That's a sexy poster.
[02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:07.860]   What are you still?
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:09.420]   I was like, yo, what is this?
[02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:10.420]   You know, unheard of.
[02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:14.820]   So isn't this a specific form of graphics that like prodigy had the same sort of thing?
[02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:15.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:16.820]   Yeah.
[02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:17.820]   What do they call that?
[02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:18.820]   I've forgotten something.
[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:20.180]   Oh gosh, I can't remember it.
[02:23:20.180 --> 02:23:22.740]   But yeah, that was so it's you could stream this.
[02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:24.660]   I mean, this is solo res.
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:27.700]   Anyway, enough of leisure suit Larry.
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:33.180]   Leo, I'm willing to play this with you after the show.
[02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:34.740]   I think we could do a play along.
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:35.980]   This would be huge, right?
[02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:38.380]   Put this on Twitch.
[02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:44.260]   I forgot to, but I should right now do a little promo for some of the things you missed this
[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:45.260]   week on Twitch.
[02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:46.740]   Now you and I completely should suit Larry.
[02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:47.740]   Go ahead.
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:48.740]   Watch.
[02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:49.740]   So met it again.
[02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:52.900]   Remember their chat bot, Tay, which quickly became racist.
[02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:54.740]   That was Microsoft.
[02:23:54.740 --> 02:23:56.740]   That was Microsoft.
[02:23:56.740 --> 02:23:58.740]   That was Microsoft.
[02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:05.740]   Andrew, can you pick up some coffee please to her?
[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:08.980]   Oh, previously on Twitch.
[02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:09.980]   All about Android.
[02:24:09.980 --> 02:24:15.060]   Google released kind of a marketing campaign this morning called Get the Message.
[02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:18.340]   You know, SMS is a 30 year old technology.
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:22.700]   It deserves to be replaced by something more modern and something better.
[02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:29.980]   And we honestly just want to ask people to help get this through the Apple to fix this
[02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:31.460]   problem.
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:33.340]   Welcome back to Hands on Windows.
[02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:37.100]   In this episode, we're going to look at some of the basic multitasking features in Windows
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:38.740]   11.
[02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:39.740]   Tech news weekly.
[02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:45.980]   Honestly, this is probably the most important announcement from yesterday, the Z Flip 4,
[02:24:45.980 --> 02:24:50.260]   which I mean, as of last year, really became so appealing it off.
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:52.220]   You're peeling off the cell of it.
[02:24:52.220 --> 02:24:54.220]   It's so satisfying.
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:55.220]   Oh, there we go.
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:56.220]   So twist.
[02:24:56.220 --> 02:25:01.700]   There's some people out there in ASMR land who are just going crazy right now.
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:02.700]   We had a good week.
[02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:06.940]   And I hope you will come back and watch more shows this week.
[02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:11.740]   And a reminder to club Twitch members, you have exclusive access to that Hands on Windows
[02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:13.620]   show brand new from Paul Therat.
[02:25:13.620 --> 02:25:19.820]   You also have exclusive access to club Twitch members have exclusive access to the Hands
[02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:23.660]   on Macintosh show that Mike Asargent's doing, our ultimate Linux show.
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:27.700]   What we've been doing is we launch shows in the club because club members are paying
[02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:29.940]   for it before we can get advertisers.
[02:25:29.940 --> 02:25:34.660]   So this way you help us launch new shows and then shows like this week in space, which
[02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:40.260]   launched in the club then gets launched quite literally into the public space once we build
[02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:41.260]   up the audience.
[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:44.620]   So this is one of the most important things that club Twitch does.
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:49.500]   At seven bucks a month, you get ad free versions of all the shows, access to the fabulous
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:53.700]   Discord where there's always great content going on in conversations.
[02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:56.940]   That's really a social network and then the Twipless feed.
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:25:59.900]   But that seven bucks a month really helps us also generate new content.
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:02.340]   We have lots of plans for the future.
[02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:04.220]   Thanks to our club members.
[02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:08.500]   If you're not a member yet, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:12.460]   And I should mention that what we are doing with Hands on Mac and Hands on Windows is shows
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:17.500]   that our broader general interest were putting those out on YouTube on our Twit channel on
[02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:18.500]   YouTube.
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:21.140]   So you can at least get a taste of what the show is like.
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:25.620]   And so I think there is a Hands on Windows coming out that is Windows shortcuts.
[02:26:25.620 --> 02:26:29.420]   Mike had did one looking at the brand new Mac OS.
[02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:32.300]   So those are available on our YouTube feed as well.
[02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:34.460]   Just to give you a taste.
[02:26:34.460 --> 02:26:37.220]   And thanks to all our club members.
[02:26:37.220 --> 02:26:41.060]   Did you see this Netflix speaking of games?
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:42.700]   Netflix launched games.
[02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:44.300]   Remember that?
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:50.300]   According to stats, less fewer than 1% of Netflix subscribers are playing.
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:53.980]   Have anybody played any of the Netflix games?
[02:26:53.980 --> 02:27:00.580]   I'm a little confused by that because the daily active user number was 1.7 million.
[02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:01.580]   Well that's pretty good.
[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:02.580]   Yeah.
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:03.580]   Yeah.
[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:04.580]   So right.
[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:09.100]   That's less than 1% of the 20 million subscribers.
[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:15.380]   So when I framed this story on my show, I said, can someone tell me is this good or terrible,
[02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:16.380]   terrible, terrible?
[02:27:16.380 --> 02:27:19.020]   It sounds terrible if it's less than 1%.
[02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:25.180]   But if the whole point is that they want to do new things to keep you inside the app to
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:28.980]   give value so you don't feel bad about paying the subscription.
[02:27:28.980 --> 02:27:32.660]   If 1.7 million people are playing games on Netflix or--
[02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:33.660]   Good point.
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:34.660]   Like that's not--
[02:27:34.660 --> 02:27:35.660]   Every day.
[02:27:35.660 --> 02:27:36.660]   Terrible.
[02:27:36.660 --> 02:27:38.140]   No, that's a good point.
[02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:42.540]   You've given 1.7 million people another reason to keep paying the subscription.
[02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:46.900]   Tell me a Netflix show that has more than 1.7 million watch viewers.
[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:49.340]   That's actually a very good point.
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:53.740]   And listen, I could be wrong because I agree that less than 1% of their user base sounds
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:54.980]   terrible.
[02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:59.780]   But for what they're trying to achieve with going into gaming, it didn't sound terrible
[02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:00.780]   to me.
[02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:05.820]   They did spend hundreds of millions of dollars acquiring these gaming companies.
[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:06.860]   But I think you know what?
[02:28:06.860 --> 02:28:07.980]   You're making excellent points.
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:10.460]   So forget that headline.
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:15.500]   1.7 million daily active users, if anything, is pretty darn good.
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:16.500]   So these are all the things.
[02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:18.300]   Time for it to mature, right?
[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:22.460]   Like people need to figure it out because people still think that Discord is just for
[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:28.100]   gamers and as you and I and other people are starting to be really thriving, amazing
[02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:31.860]   communities, I'm still getting-- but isn't Discord just for gamers?
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:32.860]   I don't want to do that.
[02:28:32.860 --> 02:28:34.380]   It's like, no, man.
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:35.380]   So labeling.
[02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:36.380]   Yeah.
[02:28:36.380 --> 02:28:38.260]   Denise, what were you going to say?
[02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:43.220]   Not only labeling, but like what tech, what platform are these all mobile games that you
[02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:44.220]   do on the phone?
[02:28:44.220 --> 02:28:48.420]   I'm not going to sit on my couch and play a game on Netflix on the TV, am I?
[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:49.980]   It's all of the above.
[02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:55.900]   And one of the weird things is that they're limiting it, at least right now, to tie-ins
[02:28:55.900 --> 02:28:57.500]   to their existing shows.
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:28:59.980]   So it's like Stranger Things, the game.
[02:28:59.980 --> 02:29:01.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:01.180 --> 02:29:04.500]   Which maybe is good because then it grows affinity or whatever.
[02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:11.140]   But like, so they're not trying to build their own Fortnite yet, right?
[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:18.260]   But again, if the issue is is they lost subscribers for the first time ever last quarter.
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:23.060]   And they just have to-- they're trying to throw anything against the wall to see what
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:27.660]   sticks in terms of adding more value to keep people subscribing because of all the new
[02:29:27.660 --> 02:29:29.340]   competition.
[02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:30.340]   I don't know.
[02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:37.420]   Like, even if it was just Snake or Solitaire, but 1.7 million people a day were in the Netflix
[02:29:37.420 --> 02:29:41.380]   app to play Snake or Solitaire, that doesn't hurt them.
[02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:42.380]   It's a good point.
[02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:43.380]   Yeah.
[02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:45.180]   A lot of it has to do with education, okay?
[02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:54.180]   So when I first went to Japan, we were just getting into the handheld console games like
[02:29:54.180 --> 02:29:58.580]   the PSP and the Game Boy--
[02:29:58.580 --> 02:29:59.580]   DST.
[02:29:59.580 --> 02:30:02.940]   --the second version of the Game Boy, the DS when you opened it.
[02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:06.300]   And there were very small market here in the US at that particular time.
[02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:11.260]   And I went to Japan and I'm in a train riding culture and then going to Korea right after
[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:13.420]   and another train riding culture.
[02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:17.220]   Everybody's in there with some small micro thing in their hand doing that.
[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:22.100]   So even the idea of watching TV shows and movies or whatever in your hand seems weird
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:28.260]   when I was in Japan, manga in your phone as comic books, like just going down everybody.
[02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:33.300]   Like 8 to 80, blind, creepy, crazy, everyone's reading this stuff on their phone.
[02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:39.380]   We see so many things from our own lens and we're not anywhere near the biggest market
[02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:42.620]   as we saw in the WhatsApp thing, a minute ago.
[02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:49.300]   Like in places like China and in certain areas in Korea and Japan, the computer is basically
[02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:51.300]   the one that fits in your pocket.
[02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:55.420]   You know, people are not-- they don't have the time, the space, or the wherewithal, even
[02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:56.900]   own a full computer.
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:31:01.340]   So we have to start to do that a little bit more, like understand there is a global lens
[02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:04.340]   that has to be a lot of the things that we're seeing.
[02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:08.340]   And I think that's a lot of the things that we're seeing in our own world.
[02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:12.340]   And I think that's a lot of the things that we're seeing in our world.
[02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:15.340]   And I think that's a lot of things that we're seeing in our world.
[02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:18.340]   And I think that's a lot of things that we're seeing in our world.
[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:21.340]   And I think that's a lot of things that we're seeing in our world.
[02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:24.340]   And I think that's a lot of things that we're seeing in our world.
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:27.340]   And I think that's a lot of things that we're seeing in our world.
[02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:32.340]   And I think that's a lot of things that we do.
[02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:37.340]   And yet I feel like Netflix-- there's not a lot of content I want to watch on Netflix.
[02:31:37.340 --> 02:31:40.340]   It's the least used of the services that I pay for.
[02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:42.340]   How long can that go on before people go?
[02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:45.340]   Yeah, I guess this is the one I'm going to drop, especially since the most expensive one.
[02:31:45.340 --> 02:31:49.340]   Hey, Leo, listen, how many people are still paying for AOL emails?
[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.340]   There's an idyllic--
[02:31:50.340 --> 02:31:54.340]   Everybody who works into my radio show is paying for AOL.
[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:57.340]   And then I'm subscribing too.
[02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:59.340]   Here's another one that--
[02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:02.340]   I feel like in the long run it's going to hurt.
[02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:03.340]   What's been missing?
[02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:04.340]   They were hoping with this.
[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:06.340]   What is it? The Grey Man, this new movie.
[02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:08.340]   They were hoping that was going to be it.
[02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:09.340]   It wasn't.
[02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:10.340]   It didn't.
[02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:16.340]   I think Stranger Things season three for all the hype and publicity didn't really capture people's attention.
[02:32:16.340 --> 02:32:19.340]   Doc, I want you to go after me.
[02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:21.340]   Let me step on this real quick.
[02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:28.340]   The long-term play for everything, the solution for Netflix's problem is their own IP library.
[02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:30.340]   They got to have a winning show.
[02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:31.340]   They got to have a new show.
[02:32:31.340 --> 02:32:40.340]   If they owned Star Wars, it would be a problem because they'd have a great Star Wars game to go along with the Star Wars shows that are coming out or whatever.
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:45.340]   The long-term thing is they are, as someone's, again, smarter than me, said this this week,
[02:32:45.340 --> 02:32:52.340]   they're becoming a media company, which they always were, but they got a certain halo by pretending to be a tech company.
[02:32:52.340 --> 02:32:53.340]   Yes.
[02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:55.340]   Doc, I'm sorry to step on you, but that--
[02:32:55.340 --> 02:32:56.340]   But no, the economics--
[02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:57.340]   What's happening?
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:32:58.340]   Yeah.
[02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:12.340]   I would back you up and say, they have been secretly talking about generating a podcasting network in order to try to pull some of my crew over to their side as a way of taking bigger shows that exist on YouTube.
[02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:20.340]   Because if you've got a great show that everyone loves, there's this whole ecosystem of everyone geeking out about it and talking about it, so why not have a piece of that action?
[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:21.340]   Right, exactly.
[02:33:21.340 --> 02:33:22.340]   Yes, right.
[02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:24.340]   So they're trying to do that as well.
[02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:37.340]   And what's going to happen is, I think they'll eventually get there, but they're in the same position as TV and radio was when we first got to sort of the end of the entire records era, give the people what they want.
[02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:52.340]   And if you're paying attention, stop dumping all your money on these big shows that tank when they could have went and bought literally 300 really good top-level YouTube shows with million followings.
[02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:56.340]   And they would have been bigger for them than to do that, right?
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:34:03.340]   Like, I'm not going to say that Leo wants to sell, but if Netflix came in and said, "Hey, let's put the Twit Universe on Netflix."
[02:34:03.340 --> 02:34:04.340]   No, they wouldn't hear me.
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:09.340]   If they do podcasts, what they're going to do is fan casts for the shows they already have.
[02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:11.340]   They'll do a Squid Game fan cast.
[02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:12.340]   Genius.
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:14.340]   That's what builds audience.
[02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:16.340]   That's the smart thing to do.
[02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:18.340]   That's what the ad's going to be.
[02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:19.340]   That's what Spotify did.
[02:34:19.340 --> 02:34:21.340]   Spotify did that with Ringer.
[02:34:21.340 --> 02:34:25.340]   They bought the Ringer not for the sports content, but for all of the pop culture content.
[02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:26.340]   Yeah, I agree 100%.
[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:27.340]   Correct.
[02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:29.340]   I wanted to ask this question before we left.
[02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:37.340]   Does anybody else get irritated when you're watching a movie or a TV show or something like, you know, Stranger Things?
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:42.340]   And you see a shark jumping moment that says, "Oh, they're going to make a video game out of this part."
[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:43.340]   No.
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:44.340]   Have you seen that?
[02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:45.340]   Is that the case?
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:46.340]   Oh, yes.
[02:34:46.340 --> 02:34:51.340]   All the time, especially in sci-fi movies or things where they think that might generate.
[02:34:51.340 --> 02:34:56.340]   I'm like, they're writing a plot of a video game at the same time they're making this movie.
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:57.340]   That's the...
[02:34:57.340 --> 02:35:02.340]   Because I always will read a novel and go, "Oh, yeah, this guy wants to sell an option for a movie.
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:03.340]   He's writing a movie."
[02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:07.340]   But I haven't seen that yet seeing a TV show saying, "Oh, yeah, they're writing a video game."
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:10.340]   The next time I see one, I'm going to @ you.
[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:12.340]   Is there going to be an experience video game?
[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:13.340]   That's all I want to know.
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:15.340]   See, good one.
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:16.340]   There's another good one.
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:17.340]   Wouldn't that be a good one?
[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:18.340]   Yeah.
[02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:19.340]   Yes.
[02:35:19.340 --> 02:35:23.340]   And then they could put it on the Amazon version of their gaming platform for Prime Games and...
[02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:24.340]   Isn't that what...
[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:30.740]   Isn't that what Lucas did right, though, was instead of creating a series of movies, he
[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:32.500]   created a world.
[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:34.540]   His real skill was world-building.
[02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:39.740]   And the success of the Star Wars Empire is not the nine movies.
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:44.380]   It is movies, TV shows, video games, action figures.
[02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:45.380]   It is all of that.
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:47.700]   It's the dis-amusement box.
[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:53.860]   The disappointing thing about, as someone, we all grew up with this stuff.
[02:35:53.860 --> 02:35:56.820]   As a kid, there were the three movies and that was it.
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:59.260]   And then all I wanted was like, "Well, what about this world?
[02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:00.260]   What if we expanded?
[02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:03.380]   What if we went over here away from the Skywalker's?"
[02:36:03.380 --> 02:36:07.020]   And like, "What is it like to be a worker on the Death Star?"
[02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:08.020]   Whatever.
[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:13.340]   And all we've gotten from these idiots since they bought Star Wars is Skywalker, Skywalker,
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:14.340]   Skywalker.
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:18.180]   Oh, let's do a new show where we also have to protect a kid.
[02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:21.260]   It turns out it's baby Leia because we had baby...
[02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:27.500]   What, like, he created a universe and the promise we thought was, "Okay, let's go explore
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:30.820]   the dark corners of this universe or the corner over here."
[02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:32.420]   But they just recycled the same crap.
[02:36:32.420 --> 02:36:33.420]   I agree.
[02:36:33.420 --> 02:36:34.780]   Do you think that's because George sold it?
[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:37.660]   If George had kept it, he would have done that.
[02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:40.380]   I don't think George has...
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:42.580]   I think part of it is Disney.
[02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:44.900]   I think part of it is Disney.
[02:36:44.900 --> 02:36:45.900]   It's Disney.
[02:36:45.900 --> 02:36:50.780]   Brian is on point 115%.
[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:56.860]   At the time, George got the storyteller moniker.
[02:36:56.860 --> 02:37:00.420]   People as a Japanese history major, George stole that.
[02:37:00.420 --> 02:37:03.460]   Old research, the Ashikaga Shogane.
[02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:04.900]   It is the Ashikaga Shogane.
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:08.660]   You can say that for a lot of things.
[02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:10.180]   This is an archetype.
[02:37:10.180 --> 02:37:12.740]   You could say that.
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:16.340]   I don't think George pretends that there was anything particularly original about it.
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:20.620]   He even talks about the hero with a thousand faces and other...
[02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:24.620]   It's a classic hero story.
[02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:27.660]   But he put it together in the right way and he did it.
[02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:32.300]   I think he was smart about world building and I think he would have done what's it like
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:35.180]   to be the janitor on the Death Star?
[02:37:35.180 --> 02:37:36.900]   I think he would have done that.
[02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:37.900]   I think that would have...
[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:43.540]   What we're seeing now is Disney and the people trying to...
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:48.340]   Look at films, trying to create MCU after the MCU started.
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:49.340]   So it's going to happen.
[02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:50.340]   Everything will get...
[02:37:50.340 --> 02:37:55.260]   No matter what anyone does, even if it's good, will get parallel to trying to be the
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:56.260]   MCU.
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:38:01.740]   I find it hilarious because DC cannot string together a DC version of the MCU, the Savior's
[02:38:01.740 --> 02:38:06.100]   soul, and they've been trying for 10 years now.
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:11.340]   I have to do this story because I have gotten at least 100 emails from people saying to
[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:13.460]   just see this.
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:17.300]   Jared Mock lived in rural Michigan.
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:18.740]   He wanted internet access.
[02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:19.740]   He asked Comcast.
[02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:24.900]   They said, "That'll be $50,000 to trench out to your house."
[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:31.620]   So instead, he went out and got wholesale fiber, created an ISP for 30 homes.
[02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:36.260]   It's by itself a success story, washed in all fiber properties.
[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:40.300]   By the way, I lived in Washtenaw County for five years.
[02:38:40.300 --> 02:38:41.300]   Oh, you know.
[02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:42.300]   That's where Ann Arbor is.
[02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:48.780]   Now, granted, there are rural areas, even outside of Ann Arbor, but it's not like this
[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:51.260]   is the Upper Peninsula or something.
[02:38:51.260 --> 02:38:52.700]   It's not woods.
[02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:53.700]   Yes.
[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:54.700]   Yeah.
[02:38:54.700 --> 02:38:58.860]   He has 70 customers, but now here's the best story.
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:06.780]   The American Rescue Plan's Corona virus, state and local fiscal recovery funds, a $71 million
[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:12.660]   fund to Washtenaw County, some of that's going to be dedicated to mock.
[02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:19.020]   He's going to actually get a couple of mill to add more properties.
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:25.300]   The government says you need to add 417 addresses in freedom, Lima, Lodi, and how do you pronounce
[02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:26.300]   that?
[02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:27.300]   S.H.E.O.
[02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:28.300]   S.I.O.
[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:29.300]   Of course.
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:30.300]   S.H.E.O.
[02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:34.060]   Hey, listen, there's a there's a there's a there's a Milan, Michigan that has spelled
[02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:35.060]   Milan.
[02:39:35.060 --> 02:39:36.060]   I know.
[02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:38.820]   Michiganers love to they like to make it off.
[02:39:38.820 --> 02:39:42.340]   So what is Lima pronounced Lima or Lima?
[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:43.340]   Lima.
[02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:44.340]   Lima.
[02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:45.340]   Yeah.
[02:39:45.340 --> 02:39:46.340]   Yeah.
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:47.340]   Lodi in California.
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:48.340]   We say Lodi.
[02:39:48.340 --> 02:39:49.340]   Do they say Lodi?
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:50.340]   Lodi.
[02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:51.340]   Lodi.
[02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:52.340]   Lodi.
[02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:54.660]   So the contract from the feds says you have to add 714 locations.
[02:39:54.660 --> 02:39:55.900]   He said this is so much money.
[02:39:55.900 --> 02:40:03.980]   I can add another 600 fiber customers to my my plan.
[02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:08.500]   I think this is so such a great story of local local internet.
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:09.500]   I did that one too.
[02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:16.660]   And I love it because again, it's just sort of like it's sort of like a DIY project that
[02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:17.660]   took off.
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:18.660]   Yeah.
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:22.820]   He didn't because he says in the story something like, well, they did a request for proposal.
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:25.420]   And I sent in one that took the whole thing.
[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:28.260]   And that was probably stupid, but they got it.
[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:29.740]   They got it.
[02:40:29.740 --> 02:40:34.500]   2.6 million dollars in the federal funds to build out his ISP.
[02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:35.980]   So that's a happy story.
[02:40:35.980 --> 02:40:36.980]   I like to end.
[02:40:36.980 --> 02:40:37.980]   That is a great story.
[02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:43.660]   It's funny to when the original sort of thing I saw in this is probably like two or
[02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:48.260]   three years old when he was first starting out and all of the comments were very hate
[02:40:48.260 --> 02:40:51.660]   commenting about well, he had to be rich because he needed to have the money to dig the
[02:40:51.660 --> 02:40:53.100]   churches and all of that.
[02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:55.180]   I like people you guys are missing the point.
[02:40:55.180 --> 02:41:00.140]   I mean, first of all, the guys, you know, lives up there and he has a boat and, you
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:05.900]   know, he obviously wasn't like coming from the complete popper situation, but still can
[02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:07.180]   I can I get the comment?
[02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:08.540]   Can I get the contact stock?
[02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:13.300]   What it was is Comcast said, we will string the wire to your house.
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:18.260]   It'll cost you $10,000 or no, he said that if if they had said $10,000, I would have
[02:41:18.260 --> 02:41:23.300]   paid it, but they quoted him $50,000 and that's why he started his ISP.
[02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:24.300]   So right.
[02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:30.260]   It's something not everyone has $10,000 to string cable to their house, but yeah, it
[02:41:30.260 --> 02:41:31.260]   was just funny.
[02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:33.540]   Just watch the hate comments, but I'm like, what he did was brilliant.
[02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:37.460]   Like let it go people like you live in a different place and you don't come against
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:38.460]   it.
[02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:39.460]   I got it, but it was just funny.
[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:44.220]   And this is common for, you know, my side of the world, which is YouTube.
[02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:48.580]   There's a lot of yap talking in there that people know what they're talking about, but
[02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:50.820]   it is kind of funny that that was what they went for.
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:55.340]   Not that he actually went up against the multi trillion dollar industry.
[02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:56.460]   That was the better thought.
[02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:57.900]   So it was it was a great story.
[02:41:57.900 --> 02:42:05.900]   My assignment for tonight to watch Kurosawa's hidden fortress from 1958 and see how close
[02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:07.300]   it is to Star Wars.
[02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:08.940]   100% Kurosawa.
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:10.180]   That is exactly true.
[02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:12.060]   He's what is that is smart.
[02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:14.820]   What is the Mandalorian but seven samurai?
[02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:18.220]   Well, there's not every episode about that, but yeah, yeah.
[02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:20.740]   Kurosawa is pretty amazing.
[02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:22.780]   I have to say it so is Mafune.
[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:24.180]   All right.
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:26.420]   So I had never heard of this, but I'll be watching it now.
[02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:29.740]   I have to figure out where I can see it.
[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:30.740]   Good luck.
[02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:31.740]   Oh, HBO Max has it.
[02:42:31.740 --> 02:42:32.900]   All right.
[02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:34.140]   The hidden fortress.
[02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:36.820]   Denise, how you rock.
[02:42:36.820 --> 02:42:38.940]   I thank you so much for being here.
[02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:41.060]   Thank you so much for having me.
[02:42:41.060 --> 02:42:42.580]   It was wonderful as always.
[02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:46.420]   And you gave us the best news of all that you're going to bring back the podcast or
[02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:48.380]   do a podcast.
[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:52.620]   And I just wish you could tell us when and where, but is it soon?
[02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:54.820]   It should be within the next couple of months.
[02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:55.820]   Yes.
[02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:56.820]   Awesome.
[02:42:56.820 --> 02:42:59.100]   And you will come back and tell us all about it, right?
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:00.100]   I will.
[02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:01.100]   I promise.
[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:02.740]   Let us plug it like crazy.
[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:07.180]   Of course, you can also follow it Denise howl.info or on the Twitter at dhowl.
[02:43:07.180 --> 02:43:09.580]   I bet you could find out there as well.
[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:11.020]   The minute that I know there are.
[02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:15.500]   Quite a few Twitter listeners who would love to see what you're up to.
[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:19.420]   Will it be a little bit like Twill or something different or?
[02:43:19.420 --> 02:43:22.500]   It's going to be a one on one interview and not a panel show.
[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:27.940]   And then I'm co-hosting another show on our forthcoming network.
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:36.020]   I will tease it by saying that my partner network co-founder is someone who's been on
[02:43:36.020 --> 02:43:37.540]   this weekend law.
[02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:39.940]   Oh, fascinating.
[02:43:39.940 --> 02:43:45.260]   Not a regular person on this weekend law, but it has been on.
[02:43:45.260 --> 02:43:47.260]   There's Barack Obama.
[02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:48.260]   Yeah, of course.
[02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:50.260]   There you go.
[02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:54.700]   That is Brian McCullough, host of the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast, a daily dose of tech
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:58.580]   news, kind of a must listen in the tech world.
[02:43:58.580 --> 02:44:02.860]   And now apparently a venture fund venture capitalists.
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:04.020]   That's pretty awesome.
[02:44:04.020 --> 02:44:10.540]   Yeah, and it's a tiny rolling fund that anyone can participate in.
[02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:14.860]   You don't have to be Harvard endowment to participate in.
[02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:20.100]   But the Ride Home fund is only there because of the Tech Meme Ride Home.
[02:44:20.100 --> 02:44:25.980]   15 minutes every day, wherever podcasts are pervade.
[02:44:25.980 --> 02:44:30.420]   And we do the weekday 15 minute rundown.
[02:44:30.420 --> 02:44:32.980]   On the weekends we do the bonus episodes that Leo was talking about.
[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:36.740]   We had Chris Dixon on recently of Andreessen Horowitz talking Web3.
[02:44:36.740 --> 02:44:39.460]   We had Matthew Ball talking the metaverse.
[02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:45.540]   This weekend we had Noah Smith of Bloomberg, the economist columnist, where all I did was
[02:44:45.540 --> 02:44:47.500]   ask him, are we in a recession or not?
[02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:48.860]   Oh, that's a good question.
[02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:51.580]   And then he didn't talk to the rest of the show.
[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:56.940]   And no, he didn't give me an answer for the entire 45 minutes he was on.
[02:44:56.940 --> 02:44:58.500]   Yeah, because no one knows.
[02:44:58.500 --> 02:44:59.500]   Yeah, right.
[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:04.220]   I have made an unofficial rule that I will not have anybody on to talk NFTs or Web3 on
[02:45:04.220 --> 02:45:06.740]   this show so you can have all of them.
[02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:07.740]   All right.
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:08.740]   They're all yours.
[02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:10.380]   If you want to learn about NFTs and the HFC.
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:11.620]   What about the metaverse?
[02:45:11.620 --> 02:45:12.620]   The metaverse there.
[02:45:12.620 --> 02:45:15.420]   You know, I'm on the fence on that one.
[02:45:15.420 --> 02:45:16.820]   I'm on the fence.
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:17.820]   That could go either way.
[02:45:17.820 --> 02:45:19.260]   I'm on the fence.
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:22.940]   That one's got more promise than Web3 or Bitcoin or NFTs or anything.
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:24.900]   Hey, listen, I'm on the fence of all of these things.
[02:45:24.900 --> 02:45:27.100]   Yeah, that's the right place to be, truthfully.
[02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:28.100]   Yeah.
[02:45:28.100 --> 02:45:31.180]   It's uncomfortable after a while, but it's the right place to be.
[02:45:31.180 --> 02:45:32.180]   Thank you, Brian.
[02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:33.180]   Always great to see you.
[02:45:33.180 --> 02:45:37.300]   You too, Doc Rock in the purpleness of his grotto.
[02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:40.780]   I am laughing at this from Google Wave to millimeter wave comment.
[02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:44.820]   It is a good line.
[02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:46.380]   Denise, did you put that in there?
[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:47.380]   I did.
[02:45:47.380 --> 02:45:49.660]   I'm putting all my potential show titles in the chat.
[02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:50.660]   Oh my goodness.
[02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:51.660]   That was so nice.
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:55.260]   I like Roomba soccer, which you also came up with.
[02:45:55.260 --> 02:45:57.460]   I like that.
[02:45:57.460 --> 02:46:02.220]   Doc, tell us where I can find more Doc Rock.
[02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:06.340]   I'm pretty much all over the introverse at Doc Rock.
[02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:12.940]   I'm also the community manager at ECAM, so anytime you see some tutorial or show that
[02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:17.660]   we put together, I either recorded it, edited it, started it, or something of that nature.
[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:20.900]   I spend a lot of time recording stuff for us.
[02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:26.100]   And yeah, I do want to give a shout out to Ken and Glenn, our founders, not just because
[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:27.860]   they're my bosses, but they're really my friends.
[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:29.140]   They're really great guys.
[02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:33.620]   And believe it or not, many Mac users use stuff that they invented that they might not
[02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:40.060]   know like a printopia or a Skype call recorder or so many other stuff they made long before
[02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:41.060]   they made ECAM live.
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:42.260]   I slid in the door late.
[02:46:42.260 --> 02:46:43.940]   Will you give my love to Luria?
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:45.420]   Do you get to talk to her?
[02:46:45.420 --> 02:46:46.420]   Yes.
[02:46:46.420 --> 02:46:48.380]   Talk to her pretty much all the time.
[02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:49.980]   She is so hilarious.
[02:46:49.980 --> 02:46:50.980]   She's super funny.
[02:46:50.980 --> 02:46:54.140]   She's doing some big stuff now herself.
[02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:55.140]   I think I swear to you.
[02:46:55.140 --> 02:46:59.140]   I think she had a lot to do with convincing Renee to do what he's doing right now.
[02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:04.300]   The three of us talk back and forth a lot and yeah, I'm pretty sure that she convinced
[02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:05.300]   them to do it.
[02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:06.300]   Good.
[02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:07.300]   Luria Patrici, aka Callie Lewis.
[02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:08.300]   Callie Lewis.
[02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:09.700]   A long time friend of the show.
[02:47:09.700 --> 02:47:14.620]   And I'm so glad that she's been doing a lot of stuff for ECAMIC.
[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:18.860]   And her own company, which is Teaching People Have a Stream.
[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:19.860]   Yep.
[02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:20.860]   Yep.
[02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:21.860]   Life streaming posts.
[02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:22.860]   She's doing really, really well.
[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:23.860]   Kind of a...
[02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:25.020]   This is so much fun.
[02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:28.820]   Like I absolutely enjoyed coming to hang out with you.
[02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:29.820]   And like yeah.
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:30.820]   Always a pleasure.
[02:47:30.820 --> 02:47:34.620]   And you know, just as we say at the beginning of Loha, we can now say at the end of Loha
[02:47:34.620 --> 02:47:41.060]   to Doc Rock and to our grid friends Denise Howell and Brian McCullough.
[02:47:41.060 --> 02:47:46.660]   And to all of you, we do tweet every Sunday, round about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern
[02:47:46.660 --> 02:47:47.660]   2100 UTC.
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:50.740]   Actually, we, you know, theoretically we could start at two.
[02:47:50.740 --> 02:47:51.740]   It's usually more like 230.
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:54.500]   But I'll tell you what, you don't want to miss the pre-show.
[02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:58.180]   So tune in, audio or video, live.twit.tv.
[02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:05.980]   If you can't be here at 2100 UTC, you can always get it on demand at our website, twit.tv.
[02:48:05.980 --> 02:48:07.420]   You can get it on YouTube.
[02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:11.820]   There's a Twit channel this week in tech for just this week in tech show.
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:13.780]   Channel Effect All Our Shows have their own channel.
[02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:15.580]   Or subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:18.500]   That would be probably the best way to get it.
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:19.500]   Thank you for being here.
[02:48:19.500 --> 02:48:25.620]   I think we have to say by now we must be the longest running tech podcast in existence.
[02:48:25.620 --> 02:48:29.820]   Now in our 18th year, it's got to be, right?
[02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:30.820]   Guarantee.
[02:48:30.820 --> 02:48:34.260]   Thank you for being here all those years and we'll see you next time.
[02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:35.780]   Meanwhile, another Twit.
[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:36.780]   It's amazing.
[02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:37.780]   Bye bye.
[02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:38.780]   [Music]
[02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:39.780]   Do on the Twit.
[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:40.780]   All right.

[02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:43.780]   All right.
