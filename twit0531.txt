[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   What happened with LastPass?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   That's not so good.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And a little bit of a review and some conversation about the new Steve Jobs movie.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   It's all coming up next.

[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It's time for TWIT this weekend tech to show where we cover the latest tech news with a great panel of very smart people starting
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   with Robert Scobull the Scobullizer joining us from half moon bay.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   He is of course at Rackspace.com and spends more time with startup folks.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You got a really good interview with the guy who does that weird new camera.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   We're going to ask you about that.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Yeah, the light.co.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Yeah. Everybody's curious about that.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's got a bunch of lenses, simulates a DSLR with a bunch of camera phone lenses, 50 megapixels, images,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and mega pixels, images.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Also here, Harry McCracken.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I still call you the technologizer from fastcompany.com.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Great to see you.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   From you, I always enjoy hearing that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah, you'll always be the technologizer to me.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   How romantic is that?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Aw.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And also with us from beautiful Canada from Montreal, it's Georgia Dow of iMore.com.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Great to see you again Georgia.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And I see your BB-8 has joined you on the set.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yes, yes, you know.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   He gets lonely.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Mine's a...I forgot to cancel mine.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I ordered this Firo version right when it came out.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I pre-ordered it and it's coming this week.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   But I feel like I've played with it enough now.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I don't really care if I get one.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   You're done.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yeah, I've kind of done with it already.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I forgot to cancel it.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I love it.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It's not cheap.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's under 50 bucks.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It's a really expensive toy.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I guess I'll put it in Patrol mode and just let it wander the studio.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Yeah, until like someone's pet eats it.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So, golly.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I don't know where to start.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   There's stuff that is easy to talk about and easy for everybody to understand.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And then there's stuff that is hard to talk about and really hard to understand.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And I suppose it's our duty to cover both.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I mean, that's what we do here at Twit.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   But I don't know if I want to start.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I'll start with a more accessible one.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And then we'll talk about Google's amped because that one's not easy to talk about.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   What do you got there?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   What do you, you, you, he's got the camera.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   There it is.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's what?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Oh, it's a picture of the camera.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   You fooled us.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Now, he had a non-working model, right?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Or did he have a working model?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He had a working model inside, but they were using it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So he brought the CEO, brought one out to show me.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And we can't really judge this yet because the only pictures we've seen are ones on their website.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah, they're, he showed me the full res and they look good, but I need to go and shoot
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   with it against the 5D Mark III and then see if it really stands up to that kind of comparison.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I have a feeling that the first one probably won't, but it'll get pretty close enough for
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   most people to say, "Hey, that's good enough for me and let's go."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Where he was really going with this is he's, the camera industry needs disruption and the
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   camera industry, you know, most of the camera industry is being done away with by this thing.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Right.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And I have to say the new iPhone is pretty damn good camera.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's an amazing camera.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   The video on it, the steady cam, the pictures are good enough and good enough for most people
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   is putting a picture on Instagram, right?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Right.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So this camera is from light.co and if you go to the website, you can see, you know, the
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   video of it is the size of a camera phone, but that's not a phone.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   That's just, that's the whole thing.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's quite a bit bigger than a camera phone.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Is it?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Yeah, it's a thicker than a camera.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   The correct.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's one of the size of a VHS tape, I'd say roughly speaking.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   All right.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And the advantage is I don't have to bring lenses with me and the cameras lighter than a DSLR
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   or what.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Right.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.920]   So it has, I think, 13, and Harry, you might correct me on the number of lenses.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.240]   I think there's 13 little lenses there and 13 little sensors, some of which are a telephoto
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.920]   sensor, some of which are wide angle sensor.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:12.880]   And then it joins images together programmatically as you shoot them to make these sort of zoomable
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.080]   photographs where you can zoom in and out at will in a way that you just can't on an
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.560]   iPhone with very high resolution.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   And zoom is the big thing missing from camera phones, frankly.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.040]   It's almost the only thing missing at this point.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.520]   At this point, the quality of the image is good.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   Video is excellent.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.320]   But you just, you have one focal length.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.680]   You can't zoom in your ability to crop has somewhat limited.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.160]   So this is, this seems less like it's trying to be a step up from a camera phone and more
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.840]   like it's trying to cram the stuff that people like about SLRs and mirrorless cameras into
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.400]   a smaller package.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.720]   It sounds like this first one is sort of, I mean, it's like version 1.0.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   If version 1.0, the idea is over time, they'll be able to cram it into a smaller and smaller
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   package.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.920]   There's 16 cameras in it.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.040]   That's why it's called the L16, but only 10 fire at the same time.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.040]   And they're all aimed in different directions and capturing different kinds of stuff.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.320]   If you watch Robert's video and you look at the, how the, the way that it's got little
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.080]   mirrors and stuff is kind of a cluegy, crazy idea.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.800]   But I'm not sure I agree with you the camera.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   Certainly the camera industry is stodgy and companies like Nikon and Canon have really
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.240]   been slow to adopt modern technologies.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.160]   But it's not like things aren't happening.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   The LITRO, remember the Fovion processor?
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   Both of these were kind of.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.520]   But these aren't coming from Nikon or Canon.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.600]   No, and I agree.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.480]   And I think that I think probably it's probably the case that Nikon, Canon and Leica are not
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.720]   going to be the innovators in it.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.880]   And what we are really seeing is the birth of computational photography.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   And I think what's most interesting is not the hardware.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.920]   It's all the computer science and the fact that taking all these images and crunching
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.360]   them together and simulating stuff like optical zoom in a way that nobody else has done before.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360]   I mean the images look very nice.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   And that's how they're getting a decent image quality, right?
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.920]   They're taking low quality cell phone cameras.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.000]   You know, the sensors are coming along because of the cell phone industry.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Right.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.480]   But they're taking 16 of those and joining them together and getting rid of some of the defects
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.520]   that you'll notice on a single one of those sensors.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.520]   Right.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520]   Again, computationally.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.240]   It's a pretty crazy industry.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.840]   I just was in the MIT Media Lab where they have a whole group dealing with computational
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.000]   photography.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.680]   So I think we're seeing just the start of a new kind of camera.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.360]   This gives us a little taste of the future.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   You know, it's funny.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   I remember.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.480]   I used to work in a camera store back in the mid 80s.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.480]   Oh, that's right.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.480]   And I was one of the first people to sell an autofocus minoltum axiom SLR.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.200]   And I remember the pros would come in and say, that's a piece of shit.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   I'm never buying one.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.440]   I'm never using a lot of photos.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   I can focus faster and everything.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.440]   I was like, oh, dude, this, you know, and it is the price.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   It's very expensive.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440]   $1,699.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   Well, $1,299 right now.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.640]   That's the launch month discount, $1,299.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.080]   And you have to put it on $199 to get on the list.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.560]   Summer of next year, we're way off.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   I would.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.560]   That's fine.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.720]   I would, you know, unless you've got a $200 burning in your pocket, you know, which most
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   of us don't.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   But it's a $1,299.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.320]   You can get a very nice Santa, Sony a7 body with a decent lens and get a great image.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.120]   Now admittedly, there may be some secret sauce here.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.440]   Some zooming and all of that that might make this better.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   I don't know.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.000]   Well, I'm sure we'll let Robert buy one next summer.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.440]   Well, they're going to get out several to the pros and, you know, we'll see what Karen
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.320]   Hutton or Thomas Hawks says about it after they've had it for a couple of weeks.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   Right.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.720]   They're really going to be the ones that judge whether this comes up to the standard of
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.720]   an SLR.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.920]   Otherwise, you know, it's just a comparison to an iPhone and most people don't really
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.040]   care about their photography that I think that's true.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.320]   They're taking selfies or a picture of them in front of the, you know, Yosemite or something
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   like that.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.640]   And an iPhone does or an Android phone just does just fine for that.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:23.960]   This is going after the higher end of the market and is really trying to show a new
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.640]   area of photography where it'll eat away at the DSLR market.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.840]   I don't know yet that it'll really do that at first.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.720]   But if you see this as the starting point of a new kind of camera in five or 10 years,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.240]   I certainly can see this thing disrupting SLRs and the bigger camera companies in a
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.440]   huge way because the software is going to get better.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.520]   The image sensors are going to get better.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.480]   And you're right.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.440]   This computational photography is something that will not stop and we'll keep coming
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.240]   at us.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.480]   And who knows where the next big thing is going to come from.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.160]   So it's worth looking at these, even though it's appropriate to be skeptical and take
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.200]   a wait and see attitude.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   Lots of news.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.320]   Microsoft had an amazing event on Tuesday, shocking us all, at least shocking me with
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.040]   its very first laptop.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.160]   We'll talk about LastPass being sold.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.680]   The new Steve Jobs movie, I just completed an interview.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.640]   We're going to air on the new screensavers next week with its director, Danny Boyle.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.040]   But I know you saw it, Harry.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.960]   We'll talk about, and I saw it, of course.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.120]   We'll talk about that because it opens October 23rd nationwide.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.080]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   Georgia Dow is here from imore.com.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.280]   Harry McCracken from Fast Company and the Scobolizer Robert Scobol.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.200]   We're going to get to the more news in just a moment, but first a real quick plug for
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.560]   GoToMeeting from Citrix.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.720]   I love Citrix GoToMeeting and I know a lot of you do conference calls.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.320]   Conference calls can be death.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.000]   Oh my God, they drone on and on.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.440]   You're sitting there.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.680]   You know that half the people doing the conference call are playing video games, either half
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.120]   you're doing draft Kings.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.400]   Nobody's paying any attention at all.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.640]   That's why you got to use GoToMeeting because it's much more engaging.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.160]   You're going to see not only the screen, but you're going to see the people in your
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.160]   meeting.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160]   They're sharing their screens with you.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.440]   They're also sharing their images in HD quality.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.040]   It feels like you're actually in a meeting, in a room face to face.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   It's a great way to present to future customers because you can show them the PowerPoint,
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.400]   but you can also see them.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.920]   They can see you get the body language.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   You get the bonding happens.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.840]   It's great to keep a team in touch because nowadays teams are everywhere.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.120]   You know, again, we deal a lot with third party companies doing development and stuff
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.120]   for us.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.200]   It's so nice to bring them into the same room using GoToMeeting.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.480]   It works on your iPhone, your Android device, your tablet, your desktop, everywhere you
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.480]   are.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.760]   You can present from your iPad, which is kind of super cool.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.280]   You could be sitting out in the yard enjoying the sun.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.640]   Having a meeting?
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   Go to a meeting.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.280]   I want you to try it today free for 30 days.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.560]   Just visit GoToMeeting.com.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.400]   Click the "Try it free" button.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.080]   It will literally take you just a minute to get going.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.040]   That's the other thing that's so great about GoToMeeting, the setup, the installation.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   It's almost instantaneous.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.000]   That's important because you don't want your clients and colleagues jumping through hoops
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   to meet with you.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.440]   You want to make it easy for them.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.440]   Go to a meeting.com.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.360]   Let's talk about the Steve Jobs movie.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.600]   I don't want to leave Georgia.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.040]   I don't want to leave you and Robert out.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.200]   But Harry and I saw the movie.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:45.040]   The list of things that are completely made up in the movie is actually longer than the
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.680]   movie itself.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.160]   And yet, and we just talked to Danny Boyle.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.840]   Both Danny Boyle and the author of the movie, Aaron Sorkin, really asserted that, look,
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.240]   this isn't, we're not photographers.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.920]   We're painters.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.520]   I asked Danny Boyle right away.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.520]   Is this a biopic?
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.800]   He said, absolutely not.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.680]   We're not trying to get the facts of the matter.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.840]   We're trying to get the spirit of the person.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.440]   I don't think you could pick anybody harder to figure out than Steve Jobs.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.280]   Even people who know him well are divided over.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.280]   Was he a jerk?
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.280]   Was he a saint?
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.960]   Was he a brilliant marketer?
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.960]   What was he?
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.600]   Which is why some of the people who are characters in the movie liked the movie and they're said,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.960]   no, this is completely wrong.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.840]   It makes complete sense.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.160]   The funny thing is, Waz was paid $200,000.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.920]   He was the only paid consultant.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.960]   Although I know Sorkin talked to a lot of other people about it.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.000]   And Waz is so misrepresented in the movie.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.480]   He's like Mr. One Note in the movie.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.160]   He keeps asking, Steve, when are you going to acknowledge the Apple II?
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.480]   He's like, he's doing that in 1997 in the movie.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.040]   When are you going to acknowledge the Apple II?
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.960]   Waz himself said, I only did that once.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.080]   It wasn't to Steve Jobs.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.560]   I called Scully the 32nd call in which I said, the Apple II team is really unhappy.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.600]   They're all about to leave.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.480]   You really should give him a pat on the back.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   That's it.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.760]   And yet it seems like that's all Steve Wazniak cared about.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.480]   By the way, the subtext on that, and I don't know if this was intentional, is, I'm the
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.680]   Apple II team.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.200]   When are you going to acknowledge me?
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.920]   And there is a big showdown between Jobs and Wazniak, which might be a little truer
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:21.640]   to life in which, Wazniak says, you keep calling me Ringo.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.840]   And you say, you're John.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.200]   You're not John.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.280]   You didn't write these songs.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   I wrote these songs.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.360]   I created this.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.040]   I am not Ringo.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.720]   And now of course, Jobs in the movie calls him Rain Man.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   He's insulting.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   He's patronizing.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   He talks down to him.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.400]   And yet they're obviously old friends.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.080]   Is that how true to life is that?
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.800]   Well, I think it's pretty clear that the, I mean, this movie should have been called
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.960]   Aaron Sorkin, because he's the defining personality rather than Steve Jobs.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.880]   And so I think there are countless instances where if it feels Aaron Sorkin-y, you should
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.840]   not say to yourself that probably happened or that accurately represents the dynamics
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.520]   of two people.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.520]   You make an excellent point.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.600]   I mean, everything Aaron Sorkin does is mostly about Aaron Sorkin, but there's more than
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   that.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   And he's upfront about that.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.880]   He's, you know, I mean, another example is in the movie, John Scully keeps going to
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.520]   these Steve Jobs keynotes many years after they stopped talking to each other.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.760]   In reality, after Scully had Jobs pushed out in 1985, they never spoke again.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   In the movie, Scully keeps coming to keynotes and they keep having these father-son talks.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   It's really interesting.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.080]   So then that's not only inaccurate.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.200]   It's more or less the opposite of the truth.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:37.640]   Although the truth in there is that Scully, to this day, regrets being portrayed as the
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.280]   man who fired Steve Jobs, that that has been the bane of his existence ever since.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.240]   And that's really in the movie.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.640]   I mean, it's just that.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.480]   So sometimes the movie reflects a real kind of spirit, but doesn't reflect the fact at
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.480]   all.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.160]   The thing that's most upsetting to me, of course, to focus a lot as we as you probably heard.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.240]   And we're not going to spoil the movie since you.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.200]   It's hard to spoil a movie about a real person, but it focuses on his relationship with Lisa,
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.160]   the daughter that he did not for a long time acknowledge.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.000]   And the thing that was hard for me is they never once mentioned his wife.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Nope.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.920]   They never once mentioned his other children.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.680]   They don't mention the fact that Lisa actually lived with them several years before their
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.120]   heartfelt reunion happens in the movie.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.320]   I actually spent a long weekend with Steve and Lorraine, Reed, their son, who was two,
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.000]   six, and my daughter, and Lisa in 1994, they were a loving family.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.680]   Lisa was very much a part of the family.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.720]   And so while I don't have very much of an intimate connection to Steve Jobs, the Steve
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.920]   Jobs I saw was not very much like Michael Paspender.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   No, not at all.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.960]   I mean, certainly they're a glenest of the real Steve Jobs in there.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.600]   It's a caricature.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.160]   And the movie makers are not obligated to show the whole guy.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:59.640]   In the movie, the last scene is in 1998, before a lot of Steve Jobs' triumphs came, and they're
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.360]   not obligated to tell the whole story.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:07.360]   But if you go in there thinking that anything in there is more likely truth than not, you'll
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.840]   be deceived over and over again.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.360]   There is a character's journey that is true, which is from being a very harsh, difficult
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.720]   person to work with, to being somewhat softened by his family, in this case, just Lisa, but
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720]   by his family.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:26.000]   And he did, in fact, and of course the authors of becoming Steve Jobs point this out, much
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   mellow.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.640]   And when he returned to Apple, he was a much better manager, much better person, and much
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.360]   more effective as well.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.680]   And you see that in the movie.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.960]   That's the character's journey in the movie.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.960]   Part of it is the decision to make it about these three keynotes.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.440]   Basically, because they're only--
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.920]   And you never, by the way, see the keynote.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.920]   Right, right.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.920]   It's the moments before the keynote.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.680]   I mean, it works great in terms of entertainment and cleverness, but basically all the things
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.880]   that ever happened to Steve Jobs have to line up to these three moments.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.720]   So he has to get back together with Lisa during a keynote, even if, in fact, it happened
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   years before.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   Right.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   So you were saying, Robert, that you know somebody who worked very closely with Steve--
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.120]   Yeah, Andy Grignon, who's actually in the second movie, The Man in the Machine movie,
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.320]   briefly, he worked for him for nine years.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   Let's back up.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.520]   You know, Mark Benioff, after the second movie came out, said that--
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.920]   The Kutcher movie was awful.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.920]   Well, yeah.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.920]   And then--
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.400]   It didn't even succeed as a movie.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.080]   At least this succeeds as a movie.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.480]   You know, it's actually probably a brilliant movie, maybe Aaron Sorkin's Best.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.800]   But his point-- Benioff's point was these don't show the magic of Jobs.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.440]   They don't show what really-- why he is Jobs.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.800]   They show some of his failings, and they do a pretty good job of showing that.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.080]   But they don't show what made Steve--
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   Steve.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.360]   There is no heart in this man.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.720]   Especially in the beginning, the beginning is painful.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.040]   The first scene is very difficult.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   He's very harsh.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.000]   Well, which it could be.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.920]   But it makes you wonder why anybody would continue to work for him.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.840]   And there obviously was more to it than that, right?
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.880]   I mean, a movie that just showed them creating the products might have showed more of the
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.640]   reality if they had showed the pain of creating the Macintosh, for instance.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.160]   Here's an example that Andy told me, and that I heard from other people too.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:20.880]   So Andy went to AT&T to pitch AT&T on visual voicemail.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.440]   And AT&T basically laughed him out of the room and said, "You're nuts.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.480]   You have no idea how hard this is.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.320]   We're not going to be able to do it."
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.600]   So he went back to Steve Jobs, and he called it Crying to Mommy.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.080]   It cried to Steve.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.880]   And Steve took care of the problem.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.280]   And when I met the CEO of AT&T, I asked him his side of the story.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.200]   And he said, "Yeah, Steve came over and I got a five-year exclusive deal out of Steve
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   for that."
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.280]   And so we don't see those insights.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.920]   How was he able to convince people to do something they didn't want to do?
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.320]   And that's the key, because he isn't asked for it.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.240]   You talked to anybody who worked in the group, although his image is being cleaned up now
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.440]   by people who used to work for him.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.960]   He was very harsh to work for, but he got you to do something you didn't think you could
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.480]   do.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:29.200]   And when you did that, you created something interesting and new.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:35.480]   And I don't know that the movies have really gotten that yet.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.440]   So I guess the only reason I bring it up is I know there's a lot of interest in it.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.520]   We've been watching, reading the trailers like tea leaves, watching with great interest.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.560]   This is a really interestingly made movie.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.800]   It's a very interesting script by Aaron Sorkin.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.200]   Danny Boyle does a great job directing it.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.720]   But do not go there thinking you're going to see anything that is really truthful in
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.200]   terms of what happened or even maybe in terms of how these people actually were.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.120]   And Sorkin's earlier movie about Mark Zuckerberg was completely not.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.600]   Yeah, although this is, if you thought that was untruthful, this is far worse.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   Is that?
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   I mean, yeah.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.800]   I mean, the social network, which I think was also a great film, the big lie in it was
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.080]   that Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook to meet girls when in fact he was with the woman who
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.520]   he has now married and is having a child with.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.200]   And he was not single even then and was not looking to meet girls.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.120]   Not particularly ostracized from society.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.240]   Yeah, not, you know, and what you don't get from the social network is an insight into
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.120]   who Mark Zuckerberg is.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.000]   The sad thing is I think a lot of how we think of Mark Zuckerberg is colored by that
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.840]   movie.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.240]   And I think that the friends and family of Steve Jobs are very concerned that Steve's
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.440]   legacy will be colored by this movie.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.960]   And that's something we can serve.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.840]   What is the big problem when you make a movie about someone who's a real person?
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:06.480]   Because already when someone's an icon, we want to either deify or vilify someone that's
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.640]   in that standing.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.400]   But in the end, when we've seen something, especially when we see something on media
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.120]   that's visual, we believe it to be true.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.960]   So it's really difficult to change people's opinions once they've seen a film on that.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.960]   They just believe it.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:28.280]   And most of us are rare in that we don't want to spend more effort or time unless we're
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.720]   really a strong fan or opponent to someone.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.080]   And so you're just going to accept that on face value.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.840]   And so it does a disservice to all of the family and friends of someone that cares about
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.040]   someone that's dealing with a movie that's coming out saying things that are not true.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.400]   And I feel the same way about or was because he's already someone that takes a good deal
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.360]   of slack in the media.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.280]   Yeah, I feel bad for was because was is a sweetheart.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   He's a sweetheart and he's an extraordinarily important person in the history of technology.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.360]   And neither of these two movies, either the Cutcher one or the Fast Spender one have come
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.000]   within a country mile of explaining why was such an important person.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.640]   You almost wonder why was doesn't is he's he of course was doesn't says anything bad about
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.640]   anybody.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.640]   Right.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.760]   So but he was a consultant as this movie.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.440]   He can't be really happy about how he was portrayed in this movie.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.560]   He has said publicly for instance and the thing that maybe he was the most damaging to
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:38.680]   both parties is the the shouting match that they have before the iMac launch in the auditorium
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.280]   in front of everybody.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.440]   And was says I wasn't even working at Apple.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.440]   Right.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.760]   He was gone.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.400]   I wasn't there.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.240]   This didn't really happen.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.320]   And yet he's reluctant to say anything bad about the movie.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.600]   The fact that he says he likes the movie, which I think also is unfortunate because I
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.200]   think it's really I wish the whole the public at large could understand this is a this has
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.520]   nothing to do with reality.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.160]   Go see this movie because it's a good movie.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.200]   It's a work of art, but it has nothing to do with the reality.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.720]   And the thing is the reality that we've lived through is so amazing and so dramatic and
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.760]   carries so much importance in it that we actually somebody would do this justice.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:29.000]   Leo Leo the drama of this industry and it's not just Apple is it's a nerd playing in a
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   lab.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   It's not interesting.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.920]   I mean, you know, I walked through lots of R&D labs and lots of places where they even
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.560]   make movies, right?
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:47.440]   You go through, you know, Marvel and meet all the cool nerds who are building the movies.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.360]   They're typing code and maybe it can't be done.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.120]   But I think of things like Steven Levy's hackers.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.040]   I think of G Pascal Zachary's showstoppers.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.200]   I think of the soul Tracy Kitter's the soul of the new machine.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:08.000]   There have been great books that have actually dramatize factually dramatize real life events.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.840]   Now it's true.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:14.480]   And if you haven't read those three books read those three books because and so it is
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.360]   possible now whether it's possible to make a movie.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.520]   I don't know how Chris would be a great movie.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.320]   I think it would be.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.040]   But I don't know if I would trust Hollywood to make it.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.200]   I think part of what you're seeing is a culture war here is for sure true there in circuit
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.560]   does not like technology and geeks.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.520]   And I think a little bit Hollywood doesn't like.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.200]   I think they're a little afraid of the power wielded up north in Silicon Valley.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.740]   And they would very much like to cut these guys down to size.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.800]   And I think a little bit of that's leaking through as well.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.600]   Anyway, and why is this why is this brilliant says he was the last person to build an entire
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.160]   computer in his head?
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.720]   A personal computer.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.280]   It's a great story in the Hollywood report about the making of this movie.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.720]   Somebody saying why haven't they not a movie at Larry Ellison?
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.320]   Turns out Larry Ellison's daughter.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   I think her name is Meg.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.880]   I can't remember is a film producer.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.600]   And they approached her for money for this movie.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.600]   She took a look at it and passed.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:12.120]   And you have to think that she was under pressure from Lorraine Powell jobs and others who also
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.680]   called some of the various people.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.920]   Leonardo Caprio Christian Bale.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.440]   Remember she's the number one shareholder in Disney.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.880]   She wields a lot of power in Hollywood and she did everything she could.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.640]   She used a widow to kill this film.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.480]   She called Sony which ended up not making up.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.680]   It's a fascinating story.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.560]   Read the Hollywood reporter behind the scenes and you'll see how much drama went on with
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   this movie.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.600]   And also it ties into the Sony Pictures hack.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.160]   That's why we know about this.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.600]   We know a lot about this because of the leaked emails from Rudin, the producer who ended up,
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.880]   they ended up putting it in turn around and Universal picked it up.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.280]   Rudin took it to Universal.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.080]   And Amy Pascal who was the president of Sony Pictures Entertainment at the time says it
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.560]   was one of the biggest mistakes she ever made to let this movie go.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.840]   So it's just a fascinating story.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:05.840]   According to early box office, it's not out nationwide until October 23rd, but it is out
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.200]   in New York and others and places according to early box office from that small release.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.760]   It's doing quite well.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.360]   So there is, and that's why Tim Cook was a little bit nasty about it.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.480]   I think he feels like these companies like Universal are capitalizing.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   It was four years after the death of Steve this week.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.600]   They're kind of capitalizing on Steve Jobs without actually doing him any favors.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   So there's also that to consider.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.160]   And Apple doesn't like you living off of their brand.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   You know that.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   Good point.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.240]   I mean, the day he died, I was at Apple's headquarters doing interviews.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.720]   And they were watching who was being interviewed because they came up and tapped me on the
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.920]   shoulder and said, you know, you've given enough interviews now.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.280]   This is not your time.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   This is somebody else's.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:04.080]   This is, you know, so they're very protective of the brand and very, and they're good at
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   it.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   Right?
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.000]   How many other companies have a room full of screen?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.560]   I wish instead of Steve Jobs that called it Steve Jonas.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.360]   And we could all say what a great movie don't know what's about.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.600]   But actually that's how they used to do that.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   Isn't it?
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.480]   The kind of romance or class where they tend that it was the circle of great Dave Eggers
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.640]   book kind of sort of not really about Facebook.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   Steve's sister.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.840]   I wrote a novel loosely based on his life, a regular guy.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.600]   There is enough drama in all of these things to make a really interesting movie.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.820]   You know, just that AT&T stories, one little one, you know, another one that Andy said,
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.960]   he tried to hire somebody out of the cell phone industry and Steve said, you're not going
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.800]   to hire anybody who's an expert at this.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.720]   Should you're going to hire people who don't know how to build a cell phone?
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.680]   And I'm like, wow, that's, that would be an interesting scene in a movie.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.440]   Remember how William Randolph first hated citizen Kane, right?
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.480]   But it wasn't about him, was it?
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:05.600]   But a lot of the hard work that goes into these products is, you know, working on the,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.400]   on the Chinese factory line to make sure the finish is right and make sure the product
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   can get.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   That's interesting, I guess.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.400]   But I think you could make that interesting.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   I think it's interesting.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.660]   You know, now, is it a Hollywood movie kind of interesting?
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.540]   I think if you really made an effort and it wouldn't be a movie, because that's only
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.820]   two hours, you'd have to do one of those HBO mini series, you'd have to do a real
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.540]   heart, a real Halt and Catch fire.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:33.340]   And if you really made an effort to make it absolutely accurate and well done, I think
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.300]   it'd be the best thing ever.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.300]   Don't you?
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.580]   We've watched an amazing era.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.240]   This is amazing stuff and it's changing the world.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.720]   I don't think it's weak.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   You know what?
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.920]   We every that's kind of what Twitter is for the last 10 years, a weekly recounting of
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.480]   the drama and pageantry of the tech industry.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   I love it.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.880]   I did love the look and feel of the movie.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:59.760]   And maybe one of the single best things about the movie is the first third was shot in 16
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.360]   millimeter, the middle third and 35 millimeter and the last third in digital.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.120]   So it starts out with us total 80s feeling and it's like,
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.680]   gradually gets up to the present day.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.240]   They don't shove that in your face.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   Anybody that really helps.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.560]   He is such a good visual storyteller.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   He really is great.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.440]   I asked him about the beginning because they have a clip from Arthur C. Clark talking
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.760]   about the future that's really I think a wonderful stage setter.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.560]   And he said, I can't take credit for that.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.840]   It wasn't an Aaron's script.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:32.740]   It was my editor who said, I found this piece of video probably on YouTube and they put
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.740]   it at the beginning.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:34.740]   And actually, it's a really good beginning.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.740]   All right.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.780]   So I'll talk about Steve Jobs.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.900]   Actually, one more thing because Andy Enoco and MacBreak Weekly said, as an Apple fan,
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.780]   I would urge people not to see it in the first two weeks.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.980]   He says, the only thing that matters to Hollywood is the box office in the first two weeks.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.020]   He said, if you want to see it, see it on cable, see it later, see it a month later,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.860]   if you want, but just send a signal to Hollywood.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.780]   And maybe that's not a bad idea.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.780]   Just wait a little bit.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.500]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.660]   My friend really does not like Steve Jobs and we decided to stay home.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.660]   Interesting.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:15.660]   So he even, he is like, one of Steve's strengths was he never looked back either.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.660]   He would hate this show so far.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.660]   All right.
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.420]   Let's talk about that new camera, man.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.420]   That's actually interesting.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.420]   No, and he's right.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.420]   He's right.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.420]   He's right.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.420]   I got to agree with him.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.420]   And then he would say this.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.420]   And that's crap.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.420]   You don't know what you're doing.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:39.300]   Scandal in, I don't know if there's a text story, scandal in the world of unregulated
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.900]   world of fantasy sports.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.900]   Fan duel.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.300]   Do you have this in Canada fan duel?
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.860]   And no, not only do we not have it.
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:55.140]   I don't really, I still don't understand what is fantasy sports.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.740]   Why are people spending money?
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.300]   How do you make money?
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.660]   I don't understand.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.100]   Is this part of the esports revolution as well?
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:13.980]   Well, I think I can sum this up in a few sentences for people who want to know.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.260]   Fantasy sports started with fantasy baseball.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.260]   There's fantasy football.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.060]   And I suppose you could do it with any sport.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:23.260]   Originally was just a fun thing among friends and you'd play the whole season.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.620]   At the beginning of the season, you would have a draft kind of simulating the actual
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.460]   draft in the NFL.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:34.500]   You would pick your team, but your team could be composed of any active players in the league.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.780]   Your friends would pick their team.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.380]   You had a limited budget.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.980]   And then each week, as you watch the game, your team would score points, six points
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.940]   for a touchdown pass from Tom Brady if he's on your team, that kind of thing.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.660]   Each week you'd assess and at the end, somebody would win.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.140]   It was a fun thing.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.100]   People are very passionate about it.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.500]   Yahoo and others quickly got into it as a kind of back end for it.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.860]   So it would be very easy for you to play fantasy sports because you wouldn't have to
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.860]   do it originally.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.140]   You had to do it all on pencil and paper, but with Yahoo and others, you could do it.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:12.220]   They would calculate your results each week and all of that.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.540]   That's not what these are though.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:19.780]   What these are is something that resets every week.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.380]   And there's real money involved.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.380]   So you put in real money, it's basically like horse racing.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.980]   And that's why it's legal as opposed to casino gambling because they say it's a game of skill.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.460]   You still pick a team, you put money in, but you're not betting against your buddies.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.340]   You're betting against everybody else who's put money in.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:43.220]   And according to the ads from draft Kings and FanDuel, you can win a lot of money, tens
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.660]   of thousands of dollars.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.660]   Millions.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.660]   Millions.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.660]   It's just like horse racing.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.740]   It's called perimutual betting where there is a pool of dollars been put in by all the
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.900]   participants.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:59.460]   The company takes its big, its cut, and then the rest is distributed among players, just
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.060]   like horse racing.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:07.180]   And it's technically legal even though gambling is online, gambling is illegal in the US.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:11.660]   You have to go state by state, it's regulated in person.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.900]   But it's also apparently a little bit corrupt.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.380]   One of the things, just like horse racing, if you could get the results ahead of time,
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.820]   you could easily win.
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:29.220]   And apparently, employees of the FanDuel and draft Kings have been playing on the competitors
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:34.980]   site winning money because they'd get information before it would go public.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.820]   And by the way, the other thing that's very important if you've been considering playing
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:44.220]   this, and I don't know if you have or anybody has, but in anything like this, but especially
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:51.020]   in this, there are many, many, what we call fish, people who are going to lose.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:57.420]   And there are small number of players who are going to win, who know what they're doing.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.500]   They're actually know how to play this game and they're going to beat you.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.460]   And all the advertising, I think, for draft Kings and FanDuel is to get more fish in the
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.780]   game because the more fish in perimutual betting, the more people put money in, the
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.620]   bigger the rewards for the people who really know what they're doing.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.420]   And you're really somewhat at the mercy.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.580]   So this is a real conflict of interest.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:23.860]   If they allow their employees to play, now both sites are banning their employees from
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.420]   playing fantasy games for money on any site.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:32.060]   FanDuel has asked former US Attorney General to perform an audit.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.140]   And what's really going to, I think, happen is that I think what's going to happen is
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.540]   it's going to be made illegal eventually.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:45.380]   The New York Attorney General has opened an inquiry into all of these sites.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.380]   It's gambling.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.380]   There's no question about it.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.380]   It's gambling.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.940]   So aren't all of the people just going to have their friends or family members bet for
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.940]   them?
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.940]   Yeah, right.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.940]   What's to stop them, right?
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.940]   Right.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.340]   It's like, they're still, if they still really want to, and I did read that most of the people
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.980]   that work for the companies are people that enjoy doing this, so they must enjoy doing
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.980]   it quite a lot.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:11.020]   And they're just going to have some pseudonym, and, you know, Sally is going to write it
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.020]   for them.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.180]   And it's going to just continue happening because having all that insider knowledge,
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.220]   how are you going to not take a peek and make that?
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.300]   Especially when you could have been $2 million, right?
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.220]   You're living in a day where money is tracked everywhere.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.260]   I mean, I work for a public company.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:35.220]   If I did insider trading or told you something about what's happening in my company, it will
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:42.100]   get tracked back because you're going to trade hard on that if you believe me.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:46.940]   And you're going to get caught and I'm going to get caught because they're going to come
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.340]   down on you and you're going to give me up.
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.340]   All right.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.340]   Yeah, but if it's your wife or your daughter or your son, it's actually a lot.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.340]   It's not even a good friend.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.300]   If you win $2 million, that raises all sorts of flags.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.220]   How are they going to get you the money?
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.340]   No, but if it's your family, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.500]   You can just keep it.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.780]   It's joint use.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:11.740]   You don't know how this stuff, the SEC is going to start looking into this stuff.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.460]   And all money now is tracked.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.180]   It's going to be very interesting.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:20.180]   I think these companies are acting very quickly because what they last thing they want is
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.700]   a congressional investigation and a move to make this stuff.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.900]   I mean, you could get away with stuff like this for a while, but the problem is it when
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.500]   you're getting away with it, you're not going to just do it once.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.500]   You're going to do it over and over.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   You're going to get caught.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.500]   Right.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.300]   I think those that they have to say that friends and family members are not allowed to do it
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.300]   for you.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.180]   That's not actually against the law.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:46.300]   Where it would be if we were running like, you know, if friends and family, if I'm running
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.500]   a contest, my friends and family would also not be allowed to participate.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.500]   True.
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.060]   Not really a tech story, but I couldn't resist.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.060]   All right.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.060]   It's sort of a tech story.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.500]   Well, none of this would exist if you couldn't do this online.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.500]   Right.
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.020]   That makes this such a high stakes game.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.660]   $14 billion industry in the next few years before the internet.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.140]   You had like rotisserie baseball on.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.060]   It was a nice, teeny, tiny, tiny, tiny baseball.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.820]   That was fun.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.780]   Jack Dorsey is CEO at Twitter.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.300]   Yeah, Jack.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.100]   Finally, really?
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.100]   Jack is back.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.100]   Is he going to save him?
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.660]   I think he has as good a shot as anybody.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:28.660]   He are you.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.660]   Save him.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:34.860]   I mean, I was just in Brazil and I saw a talk at Trek and I had Twitter and I got on the
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.860]   side of it, right?
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.860]   Everywhere.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.060]   So Twitter is one of those things that I don't see needs to be saved.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.060]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.060]   Well, here's why.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.540]   It's not even in the place where Apple was when Steve Jobs came back.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.540]   Here's okay.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.940]   But here's, and I agree with you.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:54.020]   I mean, I think Twitter is on the face of it a massive success.
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.060]   But here's why it needs to be saved.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.540]   They're a publicly held company.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:04.860]   The stock market expects huge growth as it does of all tech companies, ridiculous growth.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.060]   Twitter is not growing very fast.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.740]   It's a 300 million and almost holding.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:15.540]   And in the past, growth has been fueled by kind of bogus things like bots and spammers.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.780]   So the stock market is already and soon maybe even more significantly punishing Twitter.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.300]   Why does that matter?
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.220]   Because that's the currency in Silicon Valley for employees.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:31.140]   So if you have an undervalued or a poor performing stock, it's hard to get good employees.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:36.300]   So you can see the death spiral that ensues from not having growth that the stock market
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   expects.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.460]   It's a shame because I agree with you.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.900]   Twitter as it stands today could, should and could continue forever, right?
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.060]   It's a useful thing.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.020]   That's not true because Facebook is actively coming after it.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.260]   And executives at Facebook have told me they want to come after Twitter.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:41:00.300]   And take away even more of what Twitter is seen as a leader leader in, which is journalism
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.780]   and real time news.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:07.460]   So the moments thing that they ship this week is aimed at stopping the bleeding on news
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.860]   and also getting new users to see that there's some value here.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.620]   Because this is a real problem with Twitter, right?
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.460]   How do you join Facebook as a new user?
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.780]   It's usually your friends who force you to sign up.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.460]   Hey, will you sign up for Facebook so we can tag you?
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.620]   You know is already there.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.540]   Everybody you know, but there are still people who are not on Facebook and they are still
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.260]   getting dragged into Facebook.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.100]   But as soon as you get there, it's everybody you know, it's like I'm here.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.980]   It's like going to a nice bar where everybody knows your name.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.300]   Twitter on the other hand, the reason you sign up for Twitter is because you hear about
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.740]   it in the media or at a sporting event or something like that.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:54.820]   You know, follow the Kardashians, follow Leo LaPort, follow CNBC, whatever.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:42:01.500]   And when you get on to and you just follow that thing, that's all you see on Twitter.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.300]   And you don't see that there's any other value.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:09.380]   And so Twitter is trying to provide other ways to get you from just being a follower
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:16.900]   of Twitter to being a follower of Twitter, bigger Twitter, more Twitter, you know, so
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.580]   that you get more addicted to it and you stick around and you see some value and then you
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.180]   tell your friends, hey, you get on Twitter.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.180]   It's cool.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.740]   There's, you know, news on there.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.660]   And I don't know the Jack.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.660]   So it's on.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.660]   On boarding is the problem.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.060]   On boarding is one of the problems.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.660]   If you're going to grow.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.380]   Yes.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.060]   Because Twitter has 300 million users around.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.060]   So we're the wrong people to ask because we already are there and we have already cultivated
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.300]   our Twitter's and I love it just the way it is and I hope it doesn't change.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   But I know exactly.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.820]   But if I were to go, look, there you look.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.100]   Here's this is my five minutes ago.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.380]   Andy Enoco posts a picture of him meeting the kid from Moonrise Kingdom.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.140]   Jared Gilman right below that.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.580]   Terry Bradshaw fed up with the NFL's domestic violence program right below that Darwin's
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.300]   19 eight sorry 1838 pro and con list for getting married.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:15.260]   I mean, it's full of it's like it's like your mom's attic full of treasures or something
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.260]   Amy Winehouse.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.580]   Good metaphor turns out Amy's Amy Winehouse was a thumbsugger who knew.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.780]   But if you watch Twitter, you know, you know, you know, Harry and Leo, this is the problem
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.020]   for us.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.620]   I keep asking my audiences.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:32.060]   I've been doing a lot of speaking lately and I ask who has posted in the past week to
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.740]   my right, right?
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.740]   And nobody.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.740]   More people.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.980]   Well, no, that's not true.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.980]   Okay.
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:44.860]   70% say Twitter 90 95% say Facebook on average zero by the way, say Google plus.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.940]   No, it's gone.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.900]   Even the Google plus fanatics finally can stop trying to make it happen.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.900]   It's not going to happen.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:58.100]   And LinkedIn is about 40% 50% somewhere in LinkedIn is the biggest stalker in the whole
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.100]   world.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.100]   Really?
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.420]   You have some strong feelings about this, Georgia.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.980]   Nah, they I am constantly getting, you know, this person on LinkedIn would like you to
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:07.980]   follow them.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.980]   And these are people I don't know.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.900]   These are people that are like clients.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.380]   I don't know why they're like, you know, and I know none of them are actually doing this.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:20.180]   I've had someone that passed away posting to what it's just really unpleasant in many
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.180]   levels.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.060]   I have strong feelings of animosity towards LinkedIn.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   Wow.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.060]   Stop it.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.060]   And that's where I was going.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:33.540]   When you actually sit down with these groups of nerds and you ask them what they feel about
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:38.980]   the systems, they invariably get to what you just said about LinkedIn, which is it's just
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.740]   noisy and not good and I don't like being there.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.700]   And Twitter is noisy is what I keep hearing.
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.540]   And people say I like using Facebook more.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.540]   Right.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.700]   I don't like reading on Twitter and you unpack on it.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.700]   And the feeds aren't as good a quality.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.940]   The noise level is quite high.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.660]   I can't show you because my cameras broke.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.860]   What does Jack do though to fix this?
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.340]   Jack has the authority to tell people, this is the direction we're moving in and this
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.380]   is the way it's going to be because he's a founder.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.700]   Yeah, give us some background.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.260]   He was one of the people who started Twitter with F Williams.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.580]   There are a whole bunch of people who are, and depending on who you pay attention to,
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.860]   different people are DJing us who started Twitter.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.420]   They all claim they invented it.
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.340]   But Jack is clearly one of them.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:29.940]   And then he basically got booted out and then he came back a few years ago as chairman,
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.180]   but not deeply involved.
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.540]   And then more recently he became acting CEO.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:38.860]   And now he is going to be CEO, although he's the only person who's been fired twice from
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.100]   Twitter.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.100]   Right.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.700]   And he does have two imposing jobs because running in Square is not a side gig.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.060]   But these are both companies that need to figure out their future where it's not obvious
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.060]   where they're going.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.740]   But he has the authority to make change.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:59.420]   I think, I mean, Twitter has changed shockingly little in its history.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:05.180]   I mean, the fact that we're still arguing over whether 140 characters works moving forward
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.100]   or not is amazing to me.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:11.980]   I mean, but if so, and I don't want them to do more than 140 characters.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.220]   But if anybody was ever going to convince me that it makes sense or could figure out
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:18.020]   a way to make it make sense, I think it's Dorsey.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.540]   So he's done two things immediately, like the day after he's announced, well, I don't
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.140]   know if he's announced, but there will be layoffs.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.140]   Not quite.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.140]   Thousands of people.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:31.220]   And as you mentioned, he created this new tab called Moments.
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.780]   And you know, it's interesting to be fair.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.780]   He didn't create it.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:34.780]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:35.780]   I should say this correctly.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.780]   He finally said, would you please release this?
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.820]   They've been working on it for a while.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.140]   This is curated news.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:47.300]   So none of the things here come from my Twitter feed necessarily.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.060]   They just some editor has decided that this is what's hot on Twitter.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.460]   It's kind of like the trending list.
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.460]   And it's news focus.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:47:00.460]   There's today, there's news, there's sports, there's entertainment, and there's fun.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.940]   There's not tech, interestingly.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.940]   No, it's not granular at all.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.620]   And right now, it's not all that interesting for me, but it is an interesting template
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.940]   for something that's interesting because if the day comes when they have hundreds of
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.540]   topics or thousands of topics, like something like Flipboard, this could be a really cool
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.260]   way to explore it.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:22.140]   Right now it is so hard if you're interested in a topic to find it on Twitter.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.260]   And this is a format that could work for that.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.820]   And it's wonderful because it makes the barrier for entry of getting knowledge immediate for
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:33.780]   Twitter instead of having to figure out who do I follow to find the news that I'm interested
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.780]   in.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:39.140]   It gives you a nice curated view of news that is interesting to most people that are on
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.100]   Twitter and then you can choose to follow that news link.
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:46.220]   Though interestingly enough, Leo, we always talk about Canadians and what happens, I
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.420]   do not have moments on my Twitter feed.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:50.420]   You don't have moments?
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.420]   It's US only?
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.420]   I don't have it.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.180]   Neither does Renee.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.980]   I updated specifically for it and I am sadly dejected.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.980]   Well, I wouldn't be.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.940]   I'm happy to talk to you guys so much.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.940]   George and Harry, you mentioned Flipboard.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:15.500]   And this, I think along with Apple's news, are really making me wonder what the future
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:21.100]   of Flipboard and maybe Nuzzle and other news systems are.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.860]   Nuzzle is tied into Twitter and actually is one of my favourite.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:28.500]   Nuzzle does a better job for me than the Twitter moments.
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:35.020]   Nuzzle is based on your friends on Facebook and Twitter and it kind of tries to curate
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.020]   the news.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.540]   This is Jonathan Abrams, a guided friendster of all things.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:45.540]   This is his...
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.700]   But Harry laid out where Jack could take moments and by making it more granular and making it
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:54.260]   more about who you're following, moments could grow into a Nuzzle killer and really take
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.260]   away their oxygen.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:02.260]   Or just buy Nuzzle and put it into moments and make it a page of moments, right?
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.740]   Where you can see your top news from your friends.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.860]   For me it works extraordinarily well because I have been following 40,000 handpicked people
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.860]   on Twitter.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.860]   40,000 handpicked people.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.860]   Yes, handpicked over.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.260]   I've been on Twitter for a long time.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:24.900]   You see, I have 110 and I can't even look at my Twitter feed because it's just a mess.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.540]   I just scroll to the top each time.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.460]   I don't actually use Twitter.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.460]   I'm not sure.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:30.460]   It's just scrolling down.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.740]   Don't get Robert started, Georgia.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:39.460]   He will tell you how to make Facebook be so much better or Twitter how to be so much
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.460]   better.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.060]   It's lists, isn't it?
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.060]   Isn't lists the key?
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:48.700]   I have lists, but right now it's scrolling down the side of my screen and it's just
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.700]   fun to watch.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.700]   You use Tapbot.
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.700]   What do you...
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:52.700]   Just the Twitter app.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.700]   Twitter app.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.700]   Yeah, if you...
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:59.660]   I mean, one of the things that will be interesting of course is that Dick Costolo, Jack Dorsey's
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:05.420]   predecessor was the guy who killed basically, who tried to kill third party apps and focus
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:09.340]   everything back to the Twitter app and the Twitter website.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.980]   I don't know how Jack...
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:14.900]   The early days of Twitter, it was all about third party developers and third party apps.
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.780]   I don't know how Jack feels about that now.
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.780]   That seems really tough.
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:22.860]   I mean, just realistically, if you're introducing something complicated like moments, doing it
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.900]   in a way that Tweetbot can grab it seems...
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.340]   I don't see them supporting developers.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.340]   There's just...
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:36.940]   But you know, it's six months, nine months, two years from now, who knows.
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:43.060]   They see drop off from their own users because people like the format of other applications,
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.100]   then I'm sure that they'll make sure that it's open for developers.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.220]   But if they notice that people are going to Twitter because they would much rather have
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.500]   control of their own ecosphere.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:57.420]   When they need to satisfy their investors, they need to monetize their streams.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:02.100]   That means having control of where the ads are going to go.
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:07.460]   That's why they messed with the developers and cut off all the development because they
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:11.660]   needed that control to satisfy the stock market.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.660]   I don't see that changing because they're a public company.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:22.020]   Also, let's be honest, if you're a smart machine learning engineer, somebody who really
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.140]   understands the future machine learning.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.820]   Are you at Twitter right now?
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.420]   That's an interesting question.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.420]   Where are you?
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.420]   Are you at Facebook?
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.420]   Uber.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   Uber?
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.420]   Mm-hmm.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.820]   Uber's a pre-IPO company and it's growing very quickly.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.140]   It's becoming a brand that a lot of people like.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.140]   I love Uber, right?
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:48.220]   It makes me sad that guys, brilliant developers coming out of school make the calculus.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.980]   Who am I going to make the most money as opposed to where?
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.580]   Can I make the biggest difference?
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.580]   Where's-
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.660]   If you want to make a difference, go to an R&D lab.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:52:02.460]   I was just at a park last week, which is where Steve Jobs bought the Macintosh from,
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.500]   stole the Macintosh from whatever story you want to believe.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.180]   According to Aaron Sorkin, he stole it.
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.180]   I just want to make sure that-
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.860]   Well, according to the park people, they give him a million dollars worth of pre-IPO
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.500]   stock for his visit, which today is more than a billion dollars.
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:16.500]   He bought it.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.500]   He bought it.
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:23.300]   It was sold not at a very high price because the executives at Xerox didn't have any clue
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.300]   what they had.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:30.300]   So Uber is the hotness in Silicon Valley.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.300]   Wow.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:39.540]   Or look at all the unicorns, theranos, any of the pre-IPO companies that have billion
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.340]   dollar valuations, right?
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:42.340]   Slack.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.340]   Slack.
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.860]   I hate freaking unicorns.
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.860]   I wish they'd never been born.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:51.380]   I wish there was no such thing as unicorns.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:57.020]   Really, it really, I think it just, well, of course we've been saying this for years,
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:00.420]   that money has ruined Silicon Valley, but of course we've been saying this.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.220]   You've been saying that since 1970.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.220]   Since 1970.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:06.460]   So, or some of us have probably been saying it.
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.460]   No, I have.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.460]   Yeah, no, I have.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:13.060]   I mean, what's really happened is the nerds won.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.260]   Yeah, now it's all about-
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:19.140]   Yeah, they realized that they were no different than regular people.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.660]   Well, no, the money came in.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:25.060]   The money came in and they made a lot of money.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:29.780]   I mean, when I grew up, nobody had a personal computer, right?
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:35.420]   And only the nerds wanted one, you know, the engineer types, the people who are, you
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.140]   know, you would see it a Maker Faire.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.020]   They're the ones who wanted a computer.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.020]   I'd like to be clear that-
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.020]   Everybody has a computer.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.740]   I may hate unicorns, but I still love Nyanne Cat.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:45.740]   So-
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:46.740]   Here we go.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.740]   You see?
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:48.740]   Not all bad.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.740]   I actually think there are a lot of really smart machine learning people who aren't at
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:53.900]   any company because a lot of them are still in academia.
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:54.900]   University.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:55.900]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.900]   Well, there are ones who are chasing after the biggest payday.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:02.100]   I don't think that's an anyway true of all of them.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.100]   And there are-
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.100]   Let's face it.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.180]   There's still bright people at Google and Microsoft and Apple.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:10.740]   And Facebook has done a great job of scaling up even though Facebook is no longer a pre-IPL
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.740]   company.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:12.740]   And you're not going to go there just-
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.740]   Here's really where the new-
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:15.740]   I mean, the average is-
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.420]   More of the talent is, though, Leo and Harry.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.500]   I just was in Sao Paulo, Brazil and met a-
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:25.540]   I've toured a company called NewBank where people are waiting six months to get one of
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:26.540]   their new credit cards.
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:28.340]   It's a really cool company.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.820]   It's a Sequoia-backed company and they're white-hot.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.300]   And they're hiring the top talent.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:40.020]   They're trying to convince the machine learning experts, people who really understand how
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.740]   to do all sorts of fun stuff with algorithms.
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:51.660]   From fraud detection to customer acquisition to showing cool stuff on your expense reports,
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.660]   right?
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:57.060]   All of that requires a pretty smart programmer to do.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.380]   And they can't get enough people.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.380]   And this is a Sequoia-backed company that is the best in Brazil.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:08.300]   And that's the worldwide talent- hunt right now.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:14.460]   So if you're one of those guys or girls, are you at Twitter right now when you know that
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:21.940]   there's a new bank out there that is white-hot and that has a huge future in front of it,
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:28.100]   or go to Flipkart, the e-commerce system in India, the addressable market that they're
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:34.700]   attacking is so immense that there's going to be several billionaires that come out of
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.700]   that company.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:40.380]   By the way, if you're wondering where Dick Costolo went, he ended up writing one day
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.180]   a week for Silicon Valley on HBO.
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.300]   So now they got Dan Lyons into Costolo.
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.420]   Dick was a comedian before he became CEO of Twitter.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:53.380]   So yeah, I think that's actually a good acquire for Silicon Valley.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.380]   Let's take a break.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:55.380]   We'll come back.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.380]   We've got to talk about Google.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:59.780]   Got to talk about Amazon.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.540]   Got to talk about Microsoft.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.580]   We haven't even mentioned the new Microsoft stuff.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.100]   There's lots to say.
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.100]   HoloLens.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.100]   Oh, HoloLens.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.580]   We hardly knew you.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.580]   Robert Scoble is here.
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:13.620]   The Scoble Lizer from raxbased.com.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.900]   Harry, the technologizer, McCracken from Fast Company.
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:18.900]   And Georgia.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:19.900]   He's a wicked Fast Company.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:20.900]   That's a cool place to work.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:21.900]   Really?
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:22.900]   That's right.
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:27.820]   And Georgia, I got to come up with a nickname for Georgia.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:32.460]   Georgia will kick your ass down from imore.com.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.860]   I like it.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.740]   There's a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, a Canadian.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.420]   And not a black belt.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:41.340]   What color belts do they have?
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:45.860]   They go by a different color scheme, but I'm not actually a black belt.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.380]   What's the highest belt?
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.100]   The highest belt would be a black belt with a red stripe, but I'm not.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:53.500]   I got my Canadian championship without being a black belt.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.500]   Wow.
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.220]   Okay, so she's a Canadian champion.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.900]   Either way, you don't want to see her in a dark alley.
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:02.180]   And now you know why I didn't come into the studio?
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.500]   I'm so on the guy if I can't look at you.
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.020]   Don't mess with Georgia.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.300]   She said dynamite package.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.740]   Our show today brought you by Gazelle.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.300]   I know there's a lot of new stuff coming.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:19.460]   Looking forward to the new Nexus phones from Google, the new phones, the 950 and 950 XL
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.100]   from Microsoft.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.060]   Maybe you're still hankering after an iPhone.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.300]   Oh, that's so last week.
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.300]   What are you going to do with the old stuff?
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.740]   Well, I'll tell you what, you're going to sell the old stuff at Gazelle to make money
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.380]   so you can buy the new stuff.
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:36.740]   Gazelle is an online marketplace that you, for buying and selling used gadgets, you could
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:43.260]   shop from a variety of certified pre-owned electronics or get cash on the barrel head
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.860]   for your old device.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:48.820]   If you're tossing your old phones and tablets in a drawer to gather dust, you're just like
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.180]   throwing away $100 bills.
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:56.100]   Just go to Gazelle.com, find your device, get an instant quote, guaranteed for 30 days,
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:00.020]   shipping is free, payment is fast, but you've got 30 days to decide.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:04.220]   And that's, I really like that because you can, you know, because you time, for instance,
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:10.180]   to buy the new Nexus phone, get it, get it set up and then say, all right, send me the
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.300]   box, Gazelle, send me the box, you ship it back.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:17.500]   Every device worth more than a buck, the shipping is free, but it's also a good place
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.500]   to recycle.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:24.220]   They will, by the way, even buy broken stuff, broken iPhones and iPads, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:30.300]   Now, if you're looking to buy, they sell certified pre-owned devices at great prices,
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:33.740]   shop for iPhone 4S through 6 Plus.
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:36.620]   They've got iPads, Airs, Minis.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:41.940]   They even can't get it to the Android user with a variety of Samsung Galaxy phones.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:45.820]   The new iPhone is in store, the new iPad will be soon to follow, but now's the best
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.580]   time.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:52.940]   That's the best time to buy a certified pre-owned device because those old devices are getting
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:56.780]   unloaded right now at Gazelle.com.
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:01.620]   Every device fully inspected back with a 30-day return policy sold without contract.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:05.300]   You're going to find great prices for a replacement phone.
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:09.500]   The kids break their phone, get them a nice replacement on Gazelle.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.460]   Devices are available in good and excellent condition.
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:15.380]   Good means, of course, some gentle signs of wear and tear, but in every case, that 30-point
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.460]   inspection process ensures that they're fully functioning.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.580]   There are no scratches on the glass, things like that.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:26.060]   All the devices, and you have 30 days to return it.
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:27.100]   I want you to go to Gazelle.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:34.820]   Gazelle.com to buy to sell Gazelle G-A-Z-L-L-E.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:42.340]   We thank them so much for this board of this week in tech.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.460]   I actually bought a Surface Book.
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.060]   Excited on Zee already.
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.340]   I'm excited by it.
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:49.900]   It was really exciting.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.860]   I loved the one more thing moment.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:59.140]   Yeah, because as is often the case with everybody now, even Apple, the rumor mill pretty much
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.140]   nailed everything.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:07.100]   In fact, Panos Peney, who was part of the presentation on Tuesday, even chided the press, saying,
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.340]   "Would you guys stop giving out our secrets?"
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.540]   But of course, he did it in a friendly, gentle way.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:19.820]   We knew and they confirmed there were two new phones, the 5.2-inch Lumion 950, the
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:28.060]   5.7-inch 950 XL, both with 20 megapixel peer-view cameras, USB C charging, which is nice, and
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:32.500]   Microsoft's doing this continuum device, which allows you to dock your phone.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.060]   They demonstrate this and use it as a desktop PC.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.300]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:40.180]   I met with that team when I was at Microsoft a couple of months ago and they were really
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.020]   doing some cool work.
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.660]   This is the payoff for one Windows.
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:48.820]   Having the Windows interface look the same on desktop, on tablet, and on phone.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.620]   Using a universal app platform, this is good.
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.500]   That's the problem, because this industry is not supporting Windows Phone and it's not
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:01:01.260]   about to start supporting Windows mobile devices.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.660]   Neither is Microsoft.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:07.180]   Every single person I met with up there is holding an iPhone or an Android phone and
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.860]   they know that they're losing or they've lost.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:16.660]   When they start really shifting and come out with an Android phone that I can do continuing
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.140]   on, that's going to be a big day.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.140]   I think they're already working on that.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.820]   Do you think they'll keep selling phones?
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:30.460]   I think they'll sell phones, but I don't think that they're going to be so focused on
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.580]   just Microsoft anymore.
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:37.140]   I think there's a new humility up at Microsoft.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:42.620]   There's a new organizational structure.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:50.620]   I saw across the campus, Satya really is shifting who Microsoft is, how they think about themselves
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:53.660]   and where they're going to bring products out to the market.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.860]   I think this last week was a good example.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:01.260]   It felt like an event and it was very exciting.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.420]   They're bringing interesting new products that people care about to the market.
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:09.140]   They started with an awesome demo of the HoloLens that probably is nothing like reality,
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.460]   but it was some other demos of the HoloLens.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.420]   Let's talk about HoloLens.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:19.220]   They have, they show this, they've got, hey, we've got a rig that will let you see the
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:23.860]   HoloLens and they've got a red camera with a lot of gizmos on it.
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:30.220]   Then some guy comes out and he makes a fist and a gun forwards around.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.220]   We can show this.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.260]   The guy, by the way, well-chosen looks exactly like one of us.
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.260]   He's wearing a hoodie.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.140]   He looks a little different than me.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.300]   Doesn't look like you.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:43.940]   It's like one of us fat gamers.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:51.580]   Immediately through the beautiful wood-paneled Pacific Northwest walls come spiders and robots
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:56.420]   and he starts shooting them and they appear to be actually coming through the wall.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.300]   What I really like about augmented reality is actually the game becomes part of the room
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.780]   you're in, which I think is really cool.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:08.540]   They're showing this thing as if this guy is seeing all around him in the whole room.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.540]   What's that the HoloLens we've seen?
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:14.820]   Not the one I saw a few months ago, although they haven't relapsed yet, so it's possible
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.380]   that's gotten better since then.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.380]   That was the news.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.980]   It has sold for the $3,000 DevKit.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:25.180]   So you think, Robert, with your inside, because you worked at Microsoft, you know those guys
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.180]   well?
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:30.580]   I know people who are working on the HoloLens team and I know the guy who invented some
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:38.340]   of the patents that got sold to Microsoft, Ralph Osterhout, who built O-D-G.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:42.620]   It's the little company which is right across the street from the ballpark in San Francisco
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:46.620]   and he's building military glasses for a decade.
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:50.940]   He was one of the key people who built the night vision goggle.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:56.500]   The problem and the press keyed in on it is the viewing angle on HoloLens.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:01.580]   That video makes it seem like the monsters are all the way around you and that you are
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.100]   perceiving them that way.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.380]   As they would be in virtual reality.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.780]   Not true.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.500]   There's a screen in front of you which is like a 55 inch screen.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:18.060]   A few feet from you and it has a small viewing area and the rest of it is blank.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.580]   This is the problem that they're going to have to fix and I don't believe they're going
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.140]   to be able to soon.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.500]   Now Osterhout, once he sold those patents to Microsoft started over and he's gotten the
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.900]   screen up to about a 75 inch screen.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:39.140]   But it still has a screen, it still has edges on the side of it and he keeps hinting that
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:42.300]   he has a way to make it a little bit more wrap around.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.660]   So is it BS that Microsoft did this demo?
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.740]   They had no point in the demo did they say, "Oh, by the way, it doesn't look at all like
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:49.740]   this."
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.380]   They have a history of kind of doing that which I think is dangerous for them because
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:58.460]   HoloLens is really cool and if they raise people's expectations even above it's actual
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.260]   cool and us people might be disappointed.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:05.380]   You're absolutely right, Microsoft is always giving people this promising things that they
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.980]   can't deliver and then what causes what happens in people's psychology is that we end up with
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.420]   expectation debt.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:17.380]   I would be completely happy with a small screen that I can interact with various things that
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.780]   might be helpful to me if I'm doing anatomy, if I'm looking at the internals of the brain
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:26.540]   to be able to interact with that would be phenomenally cool and I would love it.
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:30.540]   But people end up expecting something and the only way that we know if we're actually
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:35.500]   happy with something or not is what we expected and then what actually delivered.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:41.180]   And so unfortunately what Microsoft often does is they show lots of cool things so that
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:46.060]   they get great press but then people that have never actually tried HoloLens so they
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:50.740]   don't know that this is completely different than what they get are exceptionally disappointed
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:55.380]   with that even though it's massively cool and it's a first gen device we shouldn't expect
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:06:00.180]   that much from it but Microsoft unfortunately doesn't understand the psychology of what
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.700]   they put out there that they can't deliver on will make people actually very angry and
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.700]   very frustrated.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:12.020]   Well and let's be honest we're going to start hearing about this company called Magic Leap
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:17.380]   which Google has invested half a billion dollars in and I hear they're about to get
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.620]   another round of funding.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:24.900]   Ted Shillwitz, I went down to 20th Century Fox and visited with Ted Shillwitz who's the
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:31.620]   futurist there at the movie company and he said that Magic Leap is Google's first trillion
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:38.540]   dollar idea and he says where HoloLens has a screen in front of you Magic Leap has no
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:47.900]   screen and therefore if Magic Leap even though we know that Magic Leap is three to eight
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:54.740]   years away if Magic Leap starts showing off demos before Microsoft can really start getting
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:59.940]   a market going for HoloLens they're going to just Osborne the whole market and everybody's
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.900]   going to wait until the Magic Leap.
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.260]   You must be wearing something with Magic Leap.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.060]   How are they going to protect those from the time?
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:12.100]   Yes you have a screen but it's projecting into your eye using a very unique optical system.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:16.940]   I don't know exactly how it works but everybody who's seen it I've talked to five people so
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:21.540]   far I've seen it and spent a lot of time in Fort Lauderdale seeing Magic Leap.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:22.540]   They say it's absolutely mind-blowing.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:28.260]   Well this is why AR is more exciting to me frankly than VR because you're still in your
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:32.980]   world it can be a user interface it's more than just gaming VR is really about gaming
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:37.860]   but or tourism or something but this could be a new UI this could be and I understand
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:41.220]   why Microsoft would be interested in it for that reason alone.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:50.900]   The problem is and I just interviewed Jack Jack Jack Jack who's Jack the co-founder of
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.460]   the Evoculous Rift Jack McCauley.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:59.980]   He was the chief engineer at Oculus and now is running a lab at Cal Berkeley to figure
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:05.860]   out how to tell where your body is in these virtual worlds building new sensor worlds.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.860]   He says the software and he's not the only one.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:15.820]   The software for AR is going to be much harder because of this expectation problem because
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:25.420]   if I want to look at my desk and say put Monopoly game on my desk and have it appear the software
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:31.260]   to do that is way harder than to put me in a virtual world and have me play Monopoly
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.900]   in a completely virtual world.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:39.660]   And so our expectations are going to be much higher with AR and they're going to be harder
[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:48.060]   to meet technologically you're going to have to have faster GPUs faster systems than we
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.660]   have the capabilities to build right now.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:55.660]   This is why Oculus and Valve have to be tethered to a big SDC.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:57.660]   Have you played with the new Mattel Viewmaster?
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.660]   I have no.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.220]   No, this is what you want.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.220]   It's so awesome.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.380]   Yeah cardboard is really cool.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.060]   On cardboard starts at 15 bucks.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:10.860]   This is a $30 device.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.980]   It's hard to describe and like all of these very hard to demo but we demoed it earlier.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.140]   In fact I think in our promo you'll see it.
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:21.700]   What happens is you can buy additional software but when you get the starter pack this disk
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.980]   you put this disk on the ground and it somehow interacts with the viewer.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:28.180]   You put your phone and you still it's like cardboard.
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.620]   You still have to have a phone but it works with a lot of phones.
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.700]   I tried it with Nexus 6.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:38.580]   And when you look through the viewer at this disk you see animals on it and trees and you
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.060]   pick up the disk they're floating on it.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.060]   It is definitely an AR experience.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.100]   It's very hard to describe.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:50.860]   This is a toy for kids that's 30 bucks.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:55.220]   There's also the 3D coloring books from Crayola where you can color these specific pages and
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:59.020]   then you take a look at it through your iPad or your phone and the creatures that you've
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:02.940]   colored are actually now in 3D and kind of moving around.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.420]   It's kind of like Osmo isn't it?
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.820]   That's the one that yeah.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:10.980]   So I think that there are we're nibbling around the edges of this big experiences big AR virtual
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:16.780]   reality experience but cardboard is cheap and it's here now and it actually works.
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.780]   I was blown away.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.780]   I'm looking at this.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:22.460]   I'm sure kids would be and there's animals on this disk and I could pick it up and I
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.380]   still see the world around me.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:31.100]   It's really kind of an amazing experience.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.060]   So there.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:38.020]   So there we can wait for a while for Magic Leap and Oculus I think Oculus is a way off
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:40.460]   despite their bullish pronouncements.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:45.060]   Well we're getting Oculus in the first quarter of next year along with Valve.
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:50.300]   The question is when does everybody all the nerds that I'm talking to we have 1500 bucks
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.980]   burning a hole in our pocket.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.300]   I've been saving for a while.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.300]   I'm buying the first one.
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:11:02.460]   The question is when is my wife going to want to play it and when is it going to go mainstream?
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:07.060]   In other words and that's five years in the future.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:12.220]   You know first of all you can't get excited by these things unless you try them.
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:16.180]   How many people can try a 15 minute demo going to Best Buy or something?
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:21.220]   Well that's one of the things Oculus is going to apparently do is put these demo units in
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.220]   the stores.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:30.020]   I think that Microsoft by charging $3,000 for the dev kit for HoloLens I kind of assume
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:34.420]   that's less about their actual costs and more about telling the world this is still a developer
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.420]   thing.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.580]   Don't get too excited just now.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:41.020]   This is for those of you who will build these apps rather than for consumers.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:47.020]   And I think all of these products at some level are aspirational for the company.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:50.340]   It's like hey Microsoft has a future.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.620]   We're going to build this for a long time.
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:58.940]   It's going to be a 10 year product and we're going to invest in it.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.140]   And that gets people excited.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.700]   It gets employees excited and it gets customers excited.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:03.700]   It gets us excited.
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.700]   I'm excited.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.700]   Same thing for Facebook.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.340]   They're not doing Oculus because they want to get into the gaming business.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:12.900]   They're doing Oculus because they think it might be how people are social five to 10 years
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   from now.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:14.900]   That's the first demo.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.900]   That's such a really sad thought.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.900]   It is a little scary.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:24.620]   There are also they have to think about a new way of gaming and a new way to interact.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:28.340]   So Oculus, there's a really cool game that Oculus came out with called Keep Talking and
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   Nobody Explodes.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.340]   Why do I love that?
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.340]   Why do you try to?
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.340]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.420]   You're all working as a team to diffuse so it makes me feel like I'm on mission impossible.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.140]   And we're all working together to diffuse a bomb.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:44.420]   And each person has a different set of the rule book in order to help the one person to
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   be able to diffuse it.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.340]   And so you work as a team which makes perfect sense and you're not going to go through
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:54.340]   the same sickness of motion sickness which is a huge problem for Oculus right now.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.820]   What's cool is it's social too with real people, right?
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:57.820]   Yes.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:58.820]   Yes.
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.380]   And you can play that as a family with friends.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.260]   It's something that you all have a lot of fun to be able to do.
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:06.900]   And I think that that's going to be one way that Oculus can bring people together.
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.820]   By the way, this works on Gear VR.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:13.340]   So if you have a Samsung phone, you just get the $99 Gear VR headset.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:14.340]   You put that on.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.660]   You're the now the diffuser.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.820]   You see the bomb.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:18.820]   They don't see the bomb.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:23.540]   They only see the paper manual and they try to talk you through it which I think is brilliant.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.380]   I think this is exactly the kind of game you want.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.980]   By the way, Francine Hardaway corrected us.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.180]   The Viewmaster is $107 on Amazon right now.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.180]   What?
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.180]   No.
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.940]   She said she was going to buy one.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.060]   She went there and looked at it.
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.300]   Maybe somebody is scalping them.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.300]   Must be.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:42.780]   It's 30 at Walmart and Target.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.780]   All right.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.780]   All right.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.780]   Because it's just a plastic holder.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:50.900]   All of the smarts and this is why Gear VR is also smart.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.540]   All the smarts are contained in your very pricey $1,000 smartphone.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.260]   There are some different one.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:58.580]   Merge VR has a phone one.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:03.500]   I should have brought it up here but I don't have one which is nicer to wear than the cardboard.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:08.140]   And I on VR puts a couple of shutters in there and a little bit of compute to try to keep
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:12.340]   you from getting sick which is going to be a problem with these things particularly in
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.820]   the more advanced media.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:20.620]   One guy took me down the Grand Canyon on a river raft and I started feeling nauseous
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.180]   on the wear of Samsung's Gear VR.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:27.940]   That's why I like AR because AR doesn't have that problem because you're not drinking
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:28.940]   your in and ear.
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:29.940]   You're in your environment.
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.940]   Right.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:36.020]   You're seeing the real horizon instead of seeing a virtual one which causes that real.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.420]   Except now you're going to have lag and other issues.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:43.140]   Because you're going to have that expectation problem where it doesn't stick on the table
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.500]   the way your mind thinks it will.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.700]   I'll bring in my Gear VR and we will play.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.220]   That would be a fun show I guess.
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.940]   Maybe be the most boring thing in the world.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.260]   We'll play the game maybe next week.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.260]   That would be amazing.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.260]   That would be so much fun.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.940]   You could actually be there.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.980]   You don't have to be in the room with me Georgia because you could have the manual right there.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:03.460]   I'm all in it.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.460]   And I'm just sitting here.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.820]   All right we'll play.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:06.820]   Next week.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:07.820]   Awesome.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:08.820]   What is it?
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.820]   Nobody move and never.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:11.820]   You're talking and nobody's.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.820]   Nobody moves.
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:15.180]   He's talking and nobody explodes.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.180]   Nobody move.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.180]   I'm about to explode.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.260]   That's how I play.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:23.140]   So that, okay so that Microsoft launched their event with that.
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:24.140]   Sir, HoloLens.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.140]   Very exciting.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:27.260]   Maybe deceptive but very exciting.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:31.820]   They also showed an Xbox video with games that are not new.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:35.540]   But I guess they were trying to juice people up.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.980]   They showed the new band that comes out October 30th.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.340]   Actually that looks pretty good.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.860]   It does look really nice.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:44.740]   It looks sleek and comfortable to wear which I liked.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:47.620]   You're a fitness band fan Georgia.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.620]   Right now Apple watches it for you.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:54.500]   Yes I'm using the Apple watch but I have to say that Microsoft's band looked really nice.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.940]   I think that it was very seamless.
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:59.260]   Is it anything more than what I already have?
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:00.260]   No.
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:03.660]   But I think that the look is, I think that a lot of women and men would feel comfortable
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.660]   wearing it.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.860]   Where I think the Apple watch is a little bit big and cumbersome.
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:08.580]   Yeah it's only 250 bucks.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.780]   Only I say only.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:10.780]   That's expensive.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.420]   But it's about what the Fitbit Surge costs.
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:16.220]   That's what these higher end fitness devices.
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.860]   It has GPS in it.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.300]   It measures air quality.
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.300]   Has a bunch of sensors.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.260]   But it didn't seem to be waterproof which seemed like them dropping the ball on an area
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.580]   where a fitness band really could go and they would put themselves out of the running with
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.860]   the Apple watch which is water resistant yet.
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:35.860]   Wouldn't that be nice.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.860]   It really shouldn't.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.860]   I would really.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:43.140]   It also is great for golf which I don't play but it actually showed.
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:47.620]   In the video you could see a radar map of the golf course and get measurements and it
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:48.860]   would keep track of your swings.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:51.060]   That was in conjunction with the third party.
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.900]   I thought that was kind of an interesting product.
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:57.860]   It's a little expensive but I think for the high end fitness market it's not 250 bucks.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.820]   It's still less than an Apple watch.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.620]   And it might be interesting.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:07.380]   I think somebody here, I think Megan is going to get one so we can review it.
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.900]   They announced two new Windows phones.
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:09.900]   We've already agreed.
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:11.700]   Who cares?
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.660]   They announced this.
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:14.860]   Which is a shame because you know what?
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.980]   The Windows phone is great.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.740]   It's sad but it is.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:21.380]   It's dead in the water because it doesn't have Google services.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.900]   There was a rumor I saw that Google might.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:28.500]   They've settled their patent issues with Microsoft that they might actually start now
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.380]   doing Google services for the Windows phone.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.380]   That could save it.
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.980]   That would be a big deal.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:37.980]   It's the show stopper for me.
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:41.460]   And they announced a Surface Pro 4 which was about what you would expect.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:45.020]   Kind of a logical successor to the Surface which has been very successful for them I
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.020]   think.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.140]   And the new one is a way better touchpad.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:52.900]   Like the one part of the Surface hardware up until now that was not pretty impressive.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.100]   Was it at this teeny tiny touchpad?
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:18:01.660]   And I think I'm not alone when I resist the idea that I have a tablet with a kind of janky
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:06.980]   cover that is sort of a keyboard but not really a very good keyboard and not a very good
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   trackpad.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.580]   Even if they make it better it's still kind of almost an afterthought.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:12.580]   So I want to laptop.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.660]   It feels like last of an afterthought with a new one.
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.380]   I haven't seen it in person but at least the size is good now.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.460]   They responded anyway to those issues.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:24.020]   So the look is still kind of cheap looking which was sad to me.
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:28.820]   You know the red of the blue it's kind of stands out really loud.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.820]   I don't know.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.700]   But here's the good news.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.940]   And no one knew this.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:38.060]   This was a rumor out of nowhere Paul Therot said I had been given this as a tip a day before
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.860]   and I didn't believe it so I didn't run with it.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:48.780]   Microsoft announced their very first laptop the Surface Book with the wackiest hinge you've
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.980]   ever seen.
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:57.980]   But on the other hand this looks like a really nice laptop priced like a really expensive
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:07.180]   laptop but a really nice laptop which I immediately ordered because well that's just who I am.
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:12.580]   Although if you go to the pre-order you might realize that it is even more expensive than
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:16.140]   you think starting price 1499.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.500]   What do you get for that?
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:23.700]   You get an i5 128 gigs of storage and 8 gigs of RAM and you don't get a dedicated GPU.
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:29.100]   The least you can spend for a dedicated GPU is 1899 for that you get an i5 8 gigs of
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:32.940]   RAM and a 256 gigs drive and it goes up from there.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:37.500]   I decided to opt for not the top of the line which is $2,700.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.500]   Wow.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.420]   And anybody last one that much for a laptop?
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:42.500]   That's a lot for a laptop.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:47.220]   But for $2,099 you get an i7 you get a dedicated GPU.
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:48.420]   The gen's kind of weird.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:55.780]   The GPU is in the base because even though this looks like a rock solid laptop they're
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:20:01.540]   using an interesting latching mechanism that uses a memory wire that when you charge it
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.860]   the wire shrinks releases the latches.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:04.860]   So it's an electronic key.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:07.300]   It's right on the keyboard to eject the screen.
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:08.580]   You press it.
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:13.940]   There's a recorded click apparently not a real click and then you can remove the screen.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:22.300]   3,000 by 2,000 13 and a half inches very high resolution touch display with 1,024 levels
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:24.660]   of pressure 10 point touch.
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.180]   Only three hours of battery life though so I'm a little unclear.
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:30.860]   Well on that pad that's a separate thing when they're together they claim 12 hours.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:34.420]   Yeah it's great then but I'm not clear why you would want to remove that if you only
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:37.460]   had three hours of battery life except in a pinch maybe.
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:38.460]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:43.060]   You can remove it flip it flip the thing around as a convertible and I don't like convertibles
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:47.060]   where the keyboard is now on the table so this is a better way to do a convertible out
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.060]   of that.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.460]   You just flip it around and close it on top of it.
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.900]   That's probably how you'd use it if you wanted to use this tablet.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:56.820]   It comes with the pen they've heavily magnetized the pen on the new surface and the new surface
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:57.820]   book.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.820]   Finally.
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:20:59.820]   So it goes whack.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.580]   Paul Theroux almost leaps out of your hand whack onto the side of the thing.
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:07.140]   Like the biggest unsolved problem of anything with a stylus says you never know what to do
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:08.140]   with the stylus.
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.140]   Where does it go?
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:11.460]   You always lose the stylus it's somewhere in the couch.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:14.180]   This apple that bothered me but this guy had pro.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:16.340]   This crazy clothes pin.
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:19.700]   Is your BB8 getting upset?
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:20.700]   That's not me.
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:21.700]   That's not me.
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:22.700]   I thought it was you.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:23.700]   Not me.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:24.700]   Robert.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:28.140]   Oh he's up to something.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:31.060]   He was ready for me to take the hit for that one too.
[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:32.700]   He is up for something.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:33.700]   He's something going on.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.380]   What do you think of this hinge though?
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:38.100]   This is I don't even know why they did this hinge.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.100]   I love it.
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:40.100]   I love it.
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.100]   It's so cool.
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:43.340]   It's the way that it bends in and out.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:48.340]   It's called the fulcrum hinge which is so cool because it's going to stop at whatever
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:53.700]   point you would like it to but it really bothers me that it does not close seamlessly.
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.620]   It looks like a clothes pin.
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:56.620]   It looks like a clothes pin.
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:58.940]   And that bothers me.
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:04.860]   So the reason that they give for this fulcrum hinge is stability of the laptop.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:08.060]   It is one of the problems on especially thin and light laptops.
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:10.660]   And now you've got a big battery in the screen.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.780]   Certainly an issue with all the surfaces.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.780]   They tip.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:14.780]   The build is a mission.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:15.900]   You push it and it tips over.
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:19.980]   So the idea of this fulcrum is actually it changes the center of balance so that it's
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:23.180]   much more, they say much more stable.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:28.260]   It also, and I think this is probably not an insignificant reason for it, makes it visually
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.260]   distinctive.
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.940]   You know what you're seeing right?
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:35.260]   It's also the first laptop ever to have the Windows logo on it which you may not know if
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:41.180]   you watch TV because you see laptops on TV all the time with the Windows logo on it.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:45.180]   Product placement but now there finally is a laptop with a Windows logo in the lid.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.860]   I'd love to know what Microsoft's goal is exactly whether they see this as a cash cow
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:52.220]   or is it aspirational so the Dell and HP?
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.220]   That's what I thought.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.220]   Rip it off.
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.940]   They're showing the OEMs.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.860]   And it was telling that they compare it to Apple.
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.700]   They compare all this stuff to Apple because they don't care if Apple's mad.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:09.060]   They don't want, they can't compare it to Lenovo or ASUS or Acer.
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:14.140]   Are there Mac fanatics out there who are going to dump their MacBook Air to get this?
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.540]   Well, you know what?
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.820]   It's kind of interesting because I really liked it.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:24.660]   If I did not have a laptop and I was not already really invested in the Apple EcoSphere, I
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:27.900]   would think about switching because I use a lot of Microsoft products so there wouldn't
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:28.900]   be a huge change.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:33.740]   I usually type out, I use Excel, I usually use PowerPoint and though I sometimes use
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.940]   Keynote and then I use Word.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:39.460]   But the fact that I know that all Apple products are going to work, it's going to work really
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:40.460]   easily.
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:41.460]   It's not going to break down.
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.980]   If it breaks down, I could bring it to the Apple Store.
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:48.900]   And the barrier to entry when you're learning something new and I'm not sure about how to
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:54.540]   navigate on my screen makes the big change of once you're comfortable with working on
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:58.780]   a certain computer that odds of changing are really slim.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.900]   And I think that that is across the board for people unless you're in technology.
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:11.620]   And so you have to learn many different OSs which is just a difficulty.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:16.060]   So that's why they train it with kids in the schools because they get comfortable and then
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:18.900]   once they get comfortable, they're not going to want to learn something new.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:26.860]   I have to say as a long time Mac computer user, I am intrigued by this and I did order
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.700]   it and I tell you for one reason.
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:31.540]   I don't think Apple's ever going to be touching OS 10.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.860]   I think Apple or not.
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.220]   And I think I'm not alone.
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:37.460]   I mean, you're sitting there with an iPad Harry, but after you use an iPad for a while,
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.660]   don't you reach out and touch the screen?
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:40.660]   You're right.
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:41.660]   I am not against.
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.380]   I know Apple is religiously against the idea.
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:46.700]   They think, well, your arm will get tired or I don't know what.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:49.020]   I really think touch is not a bad thing.
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:55.900]   I think that screen, it's three by two, which is interesting, not 16 by nine.
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:59.300]   It's an aspect ratio that you see on the iPad and you see on the Chromebook Pixel, but
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.140]   never on a Macintosh.
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:05.780]   It's got a stylus and really now we'll have to see how much latency there is.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:08.300]   It's not going to be an iPad Pro, I'm sure.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:13.100]   But I feel like this might be a compelling product.
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:19.620]   And you know, George, after all, the difference between OS 10 and Windows is small, frankly.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.620]   They're all computers.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:22.780]   I mean, it's not.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:23.780]   It's not.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.340]   I agree with you.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:27.460]   I would love to be able to reach out and touch the screen.
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:31.420]   I think that it would make it much easier for when I'm interfacing with things.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.420]   And sometimes I do.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:37.380]   If I'm using my iPad for a while, then I'm going to reach out and I'm upset that I can't
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.300]   move something where I exactly want it.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:45.180]   I find using a trackpad, annoying and tedious to be able to change things, to be able to
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:48.100]   draw, to be able to use a stylus directly to the screen.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.980]   It's one less point.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:53.500]   It's one less point that I would have to interface through.
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.140]   And so that would be nice for me.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.260]   And I think that that's a huge bonus on Microsoft's.
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:02.020]   My kids don't understand how to use a computer without touching.
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:03.020]   Right.
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.020]   Right.
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:05.020]   So it makes sense.
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:11.180]   It's interesting that Microsoft is opening a new New York store on Fitment.
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:17.460]   Right by Apple, like two blocks down from the key Apple store.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:20.020]   And it looks like it's going to be a showpiece store.
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:22.860]   And I think that's why they're doing this.
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:30.300]   They need products in their store that represent their brand to the public.
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:34.060]   And they don't really care what dull things anymore.
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:40.060]   I think you guys know that it's copy Apple when you have to and then innovate when you
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.060]   can.
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:43.620]   And here's a good example of where some innovation is coming.
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:47.140]   The one thing I'll miss is the command line.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:51.700]   One of the reasons I use a Mac is because I love having a Unix command line and all
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.940]   the Unix tools available to me from the command line.
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:58.140]   If I can solve that and I don't know if it's I don't know what it's going to be if it's
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.540]   Sigwin or what do you use?
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:01.540]   I don't know.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:04.740]   I may actually use it all that much.
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.740]   I fire up e-max.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:10.500]   I like to do good for troubleshooting occasionally.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:12.500]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.500]   And I just I just like the command line.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.820]   I don't know why.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:15.820]   I do.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.940]   I will probably look at you know PowerShell or a yeah.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.380]   I'm not going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:29.380]   that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:33.820]   that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:37.820]   that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:42.820]   that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:45.820]   that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say

[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:35.820]   I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:43.820]   Thank you Conan. We'll come back with lots more. You're watching a Twit with Georgia Dow from iMore.com Harry McCrackett
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:53.820]   from Fast Company and The Scovalizer. What's your Halloween costume going to be? I have no idea. I'm probably going to be on a plane somewhere.
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:32:01.820]   Aw, no, come on. Come on. You go do Halloween. I don't know. Do you do Halloween? I don't really want to kiss you Halloween.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:09.820]   I realize what I'm going to be. I'm going to be Paul Blart-Maulcott because I got the Segway. I got the cop shirt. All I need to do is grow mustache. I'm in.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:19.820]   I got the deal on musk. Be a lot musk. I did a terrible thing the other day. What's that? I put down a deposit on the Tesla X.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:26.820]   Beautiful. It's a beautiful car. I can get out of that if I want to, right? If I change it on the line.
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:36.820]   No, no, I can just stop now. I think I have to buy one now. It's a year. It's one of those. I fall for these every time. They go, "Oh, don't worry. It's going to be a year. You could change your mind."
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:47.820]   You're going to give up your audience. Don't worry. My outie is a lease. So it runs out in October. It's about when I'll get this thing. It has doors that go like this.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:53.820]   The doors are super sweet. I don't know how to get out of my garage though. It might be stuck in the garage.
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:58.820]   I can put my segue right in it. It's got lots of space.
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:06.820]   I love the Tesla, man. Do you don't drive a Tesla? I'm waiting for the $45,000 one.
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:16.820]   That, well, and you can thank me and those who have gone before because apparently we're buying really expensive Teslas so that he can make in a couple of years the Tesla for the rest of us.
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:21.820]   Is that really why you're doing it, Leo? Is this an altruistic act?
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.820]   Leo, appreciate it. Is that what you're telling everyone?
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:29.820]   Yeah. I'm an altruistic. Or at least I'm just buying it to help others.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:34.820]   I care about humanity. Can you tell when somebody's lying, just, I mean, your psychologist looking at them?
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:40.820]   It's philanthropic. Yes, I can. Yes, I can. Oh, here comes my wife.
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.820]   He just wants to make an estate on the SLT.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:50.820]   Our show today brought to you a square space. You know, it's so funny because for a long time,
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:34:03.820]   I thought I really thought that a part of my job was to have a WordPress site so I could experience what it's like to modify the templates, to update every 48 hours with the new fix to avoid the security flaws.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:10.820]   And I finally just threw in the towel the other day. I said, I've been doing square space ads for like 10 years.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:15.820]   Maybe I don't need to have my own self-hosted WordPress blog.
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:27.820]   And it's kind of embarrassing. It's so easy. It was so nice. I've set it up and we're going to make, I'm just going to flip the switch as soon as I can get my server ops to tell me how to do that.
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:32.820]   But gosh, square space is great. If you go to Leoville.tv, you can see the beginning.
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:41.820]   I started with a cover page, which is what I really like about square space is it's really easy to set up a basic beginning cover page.
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:45.820]   It's kind of your business card on the internet.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:52.820]   And if you actually take away the lower third square space, you can see at the bottom, it's got all my social, the links to all my social media, and it's got a link in.
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:35:06.820]   It's just a really, you can even put like, this is the front cover. So you click the blog and you go, and I was able to get my entire blog imported from the WordPress blog going back to, I think, I think I started in 2001, 2002.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:13.820]   It's really easy to embed content. The tweets, they came in there automatically. The Instagram comes in there automatically.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:17.820]   I've even decided to do an events thing. Those are one of the things that templates are so great.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:24.820]   They have things for, you know, all kinds like I have my photographs.
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:29.820]   That's the only event, but there'll be more events soon. I can have a little photo blog.
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:38.820]   And then you can use the portfolio app to show up your portfolio. I just, I mean, I'm thinking, you know, the square space really is great.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:45.820]   It makes it easy to create a, I've known this, but I knew it academically, you know, and now I've finally done it.
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:52.820]   It's like, wow, this was easy. This was fun. And this took me an evening of just having fun, frankly.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:59.820]   You can create a professional website, a blog as I've done or an online store. If you're a band, they have templates for bands, for restaurants.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:08.820]   Incredible 24/7 support. I didn't have to call the support at all because it was just like so easy.
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:13.820]   And you know, if I decide I want to try a different template, you just click the template. Boom, it's done.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:17.820]   All of these templates are state of the art. You know, what inspired me was, we were talking to Jason Callicannis.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:23.820]   He was on the new screen savers a couple of weeks ago. And somebody asked on the show, who, you know, how much should it cost to get a new website?
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:29.820]   Where do I go to get one? And he said, you'd be crazy to design your own website these days to hire a designer and all that stuff.
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:39.820]   Because companies like Squarespace have done it. They have the best state of the art templates, mobile responsive, all the technology that you'd want.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:46.820]   It's crazy to reinvent the wheel and you get e-commerce and you get hosting that never goes down.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:53.820]   And it's affordable as $8 a month when you sign up for a year. I signed up for a year. I thought, what the heck? There's nothing.
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:58.820]   And you get $100 in AdWords credit when you sign up for the business or commerce plans.
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:08.820]   It is just gorgeous. So if you've been waiting, if you've been trying to do it yourself, if you've been waiting, if you're a new business, if you're a restaurant, you have a site that you're not the happiest with, you know, there are companies that pay you.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:14.820]   You know, there are companies that really frankly prey on businesses that prey on brides and stuff.
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:20.820]   Oh, no, we do all the wedding. Don't do that. You can do it. It's better. Squarespace.com.
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:28.820]   Try it free for two weeks. Just click the Get Started button. No credit card needed. All I ask if you decide to buy, and I forgot to do this.
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:32.820]   Yeah, I was so stupid. Use the promo code to it and you'll get 10% off.
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:36.820]   You didn't use your own promo code. I'm such an idiot.
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:42.820]   Squarespace. Want a moron? Squarespace.com. You use the promo code. Get you 10% off. Squarespace.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:53.820]   Do it for Leo. Beautiful dude for me. I got to pay for the Tesla. No, I was just blown away. Yeah, there's pictures on here that I've never, like, I mean, just, I really had fun doing this.
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:38:02.820]   And what was amazing is, you know, my real concern was how do I get 15 years of blog content from my old platform to my new platform?
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:10.820]   It was really, really easy. It just kind of happened overnight. It was easy to hook it up to hover.com. I just love this.
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:15.820]   Yeah, that's our wedding picture. I don't think anybody's ever seen that. Yeah, it was just three of us.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:24.820]   Sky. That's exactly what you want. Yeah, it was weird. We did. And this is not a fake. This is not Photoshop. This actually happened.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:33.820]   I'm looking at my phone and the giraffe looked over my shoulder. This is not fake either. This actually happened. There was a meteor in the sky.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:45.820]   Where did you meet a giraffe? That's a little bit of a YouTube. That was at the San Diego Zoo, the Safari. You go out in a tram and you go feed the giraffes and they're out there and they just reach their necks over because you've got bamboo shoots or whatever they like.
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:57.820]   And I was looking at my phone. I wasn't paying attention. And the giraffe just kind of nuzzled me. And George, it was a great moment. It was like, "Oh, yeah, I should probably be paying attention to nature."
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:03.820]   Right. Instead of the phone. Instead of the phone. But then again, nature was paying attention to the technology as well.
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:13.820]   Yeah, the giraffe was actually very curious. He really was. It was tweeting. He was tweeting. I think I tweeted that picture. I Instagrammed it or something.
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:21.820]   All right, moving on. I'm so embarrassed that for all these years, I've done Squarespace sites for friends and stuff before.
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:29.820]   But I just felt like, "Oh, I really, it's probably true. I really need to understand how hard it is. I have to do it the hard way."
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:33.820]   And I don't know what I was thinking. It's so much easier.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:38.820]   Let's see. We covered the Microsoft stuff, right? Nothing more to say there.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:47.820]   We covered Steve Jobs. Oh, I don't know how to talk about this. Harry, you're sophisticated.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:49.820]   I climbed a big.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:56.820]   AMP. Accelerated mobile pages. We actually did a very deep dive on this weekend, Google on Wednesday.
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:40:03.820]   We had Kevin Marks, who's a developer and really worked at Google, understands web standards and all of that.
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:17.820]   This is their response to Apple's news. Facebook's news initiative to medium publishers apparently are interested.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:24.820]   I don't know why a publisher would want to do AMP, but I guess they're interested in making their stuff look better and be more usable.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:31.820]   And Jeff Jarvis was also on Twitter pointed out that a lot of companies now, like Buzzfeed, don't care about a homepage.
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:34.820]   They put their content everywhere. Vice does this as well.
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:43.820]   The idea is it doesn't matter where you read a vice article on Facebook, on Twitter, on Flipboard, as long as you're reading the article.
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:48.820]   And nobody goes to a homepage anymore. Nobody goes to NewYorkTimes.com to read the paper.
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:52.820]   You're much more likely to deep link into it from some other source.
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:59.820]   So AMP is an initiative at making pages load more quickly on mobile and desktop.
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:08.820]   You can actually try it for yourself if you go to google.co/ampt.
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:15.820]   And then you'll get a Google search page, but the pages you find will be AMPed up pages.
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:22.820]   And it's g.co/ampt. Yeah. And you should probably do this on mobile.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:26.820]   But there's all sorts of new things. There's a carousel.
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:33.820]   It's... Can somebody explain what... For A, I guess I understand why Google's doing this.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:38.820]   They're doing it in conjunction with Twitter. It's open source. It's all on GitHub.
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:43.820]   But it's weird. You can't use JavaScript. Google has to prove any JavaScript you use.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:46.820]   There's no image tag. There's no i-frames. There's no embedding.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:53.820]   You have to... Everything kind of has to go through this Google approved subset of HTML
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:58.820]   with the goal to support caching, to support speed.
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:03.820]   And Wordpresses.com has already said, "Oh, we're going to support it."
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:06.820]   Pinterest has said, "We're going to support it." I presume Squarespace.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.820]   Actually, I bet you anything. They're going to support it.
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:13.820]   So if you're using a publishing platform, you might get the benefit automatically.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:17.820]   But why would somebody want to use a constrained, a limited version of HTML?
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:20.820]   Well, it's... Go ahead, Harry.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:25.820]   It's first, Harry, then Robert. I mean, it's part... It's a reaction to, I think, a couple of things.
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:29.820]   One of which is that Facebook did something very similar. But within the world of Facebook,
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:32.820]   Google is doing also wants to speed up your pages.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:34.820]   Everything. But in a more open web. On the open web.
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:39.820]   I think Facebook did it in part because media companies have a pretty shaky history
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:44.820]   of figuring out how to make their sites good. A lot of media sites are horribly slow
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:46.820]   and are not usable on mobile devices.
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:48.820]   And these new ad networks don't help either.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:51.820]   And the ads are really hurting you, because you're bogged down by enormous amounts of JavaScript.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:55.820]   They're taking JavaScript out partially because there are so many sites that are unusable,
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:43:00.820]   because there's all this JavaScript tracking you and bogging down the experience.
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:06.820]   And Google has always worked under the correct philosophy that when you start to get slow,
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:10.820]   people just abandon you. So speed is usability.
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:15.820]   And I think they're trying to lead media sites in the right direction by doing this.
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:19.820]   And I basically like the idea, because media sites clearly do need help on this front.
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:24.820]   They've done a terrible job. And if the fact it's a little more open makes it appealing.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:32.820]   Robert, why? And why if I'm the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, should I consider this?
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:34.820]   Why if I'm Leo LaPorte, should I consider it?
[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:38.820]   Because you lose fewer readers when you get faster.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:46.820]   And we know this from tracking users. And Facebook tracks everybody, Google tracks everybody.
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:53.820]   But isn't this going too far? You can't do half the things that the web's supposed to be able to do.
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:58.820]   Here's the deal. You're on a mobile phone. You see a headline, you click on it and you count.
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:04.820]   And on the average website, it's usually five to eight seconds.
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:11.820]   On Facebook's approach, it's instant because it's precached that stuff underneath the web page.
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:16.820]   Sort of how Flipboard got so fast, right? Why did Flipboard feel so nice and fast?
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.820]   Because they precached everything underneath the web page so that when you click that link,
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:23.820]   it was already there and pop up.
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:31.820]   And I know I get, I go away from pages that don't pop up.
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:36.820]   And Facebook knows this, Google knows it.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:38.820]   Well, that's why we use ad blockers.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:42.820]   That's another reason, right? Because you remove a bunch of stuff.
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:47.820]   I mean, one of the tech blogs is one page is like 30 megabytes now.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:50.820]   And if you're reading that on mobile phone, it takes forever, right?
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:52.820]   Yeah, there's quite a few tech blogs.
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:57.820]   There's quite a few tech blogs. I can't read on my mobile because there's pop ups that cover things.
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:01.820]   I can't close them. It becomes an exercise in frustration.
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:03.820]   You actually cannot get to the content.
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:07.820]   And there you go. Because Facebook is not in the business of frustrating.
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:10.820]   It's users and neither is Google and neither is Twitter.
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:15.820]   They need to figure out a way so that when you're on a mobile phone, you click a link, it pops up.
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:20.820]   And it makes you feel good. And you use that five seconds to read the damn article.
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:26.820]   By the way, that five seconds could be reading the article a little bit deeper and you get another ad.
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:32.820]   It improves your monetization, which is what Jack is being asked to do by his investors.
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:35.820]   Right? And so.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:39.820]   And did you also say that they're going to rank higher on Google itself?
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:41.820]   That's what scares me.
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:50.820]   Yeah, that's Google using its power in the marketplace to promote a technology that is in, you know, that's Google's.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:58.820]   And Facebook is doing the exact same thing. You know, Washington Post is I'm seeing a lot more Washington Post lately because they're using the Facebook technology.
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:05.820]   And they're going to all their media partners and saying, Hey, do you want to let you know, Washington Post take all your users?
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:09.820]   Because it's the same damn articles you all are writing. Let's be honest.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:15.820]   Why don't we just put all the traffic over to Washington Post and keep you from being seen?
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:20.820]   Because your articles take eight seconds and piss off our readers.
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:28.820]   I feel like, though, that there must be an answer that doesn't involve going this far and doing this in Google's camp.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.820]   Well, I hope that media companies would have the fear of God put into them.
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:35.820]   And in some cases, would improve their own technologies.
[01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:44.820]   And I think the stuff will raise the bar for user experience and it will be harder to get away with crummy sites overloaded with ads and JavaScript that bog you down.
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:49.820]   Yeah. And how do we get the industry to start doing this? I don't know.
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:59.820]   The real problem is a lot of these media companies can afford to hire a really high-end programmer that knows how to do this stuff right.
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:08.820]   And even if you can, they're usually focused on making ads work properly because that's where the money is.
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:21.820]   Well, they're incented to use these ad networks and they end up junking up their pages when they get to the bottom of the inventory and it's belly fat ads and punch the monkey.
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:32.820]   I just feel like I wish Google wouldn't use its cloud in the search to kind of, and by the way, we don't know how much it's going to improve your score, right, Georgia or do we?
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:47.820]   No, we don't. But just by saying that and when your Google rank is going to change the amount of page views, people are incessantly lazy and we're not going to be clicking through pages and we really don't have very much brand loyalty when it comes to news or information.
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:58.820]   We want to get what is fastest best. So Google, just by saying that, even if it's only marginally true, is going to kind of push people to try to increase their ad revenue by getting a better Google search rank.
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:05.820]   So it's going to change it. And is it wrong? Yes. But if you were Google, wouldn't you do the same thing?
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:13.820]   It feels like they're reinventing the web or they're, I mean, they want to have Facebook. They want to have Google Web and then --
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:22.820]   Well, and the Apple, right? By the way, Apple is -- what are your thoughts on Apple news? I find this really not usable.
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:28.820]   Now the links, for a while, the links weren't working. I don't want Apple to aggregate my news.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:35.820]   I don't like aggregated news in any way, shape, or form. I like to search out for stories that are interesting to me.
[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:40.820]   And so I don't think that I'm the person that's going to really use it. The same thing, though, for Google.
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:50.820]   I really don't want them to curate news for me. I don't like one large network being in control of what is the information that's going to be given to me.
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:57.820]   Because I think that that's too much control for too many main companies. And information is power.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:04.820]   And so if there's a lot of stories that are anti-Google, they might really push that down on the importance list.
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:11.820]   And it might rank a little lower. And so they can control -- which I understand. I fully understand if I was Google, I would probably do the same thing.
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:22.820]   I wouldn't want to have a lot of bad press about a product that people don't like. But I think that that's why you have to control the amount of powers that large conglomerate companies have.
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:26.820]   Now you're European. Now you're talking European.
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:28.820]   I'm from a socialist country.
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:30.820]   Oh, that explains it.
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:32.820]   Isn't that already where it comes to? Yeah.
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:50.820]   Jarvis was so upset about this European Court of Justice invalidating a safe harbor agreement between the United States and the European Union that would allow U.S. companies to kind of say self-certify compliance with privacy rules in the EU.
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:50:09.820]   Now they're saying that there's no safe harbor and that every company who does business in the EU, including Google and Facebook, has to adhere to the privacy regulations of each and every country in the EU, which is very scary because that's a difficult thing to do.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:15.820]   On the other hand, I understand a lot of privacy advocates applauded this.
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:21.820]   So I don't know what to say. It feels like it breaks the Internet also. It feels like there's a lot of things going on to break the Internet.
[01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.820]   Stop it.
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:25.820]   Knock it off.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:32.820]   Hey, did you miss anything this week? We had some good shows. Let me, you know what? I got a little cut down. I'd like to show you.
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:38.820]   Some of the things you missed this week on Twitch previously on Twitch says, "Look at a reel."
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:42.820]   Oh, oh, there's no aminals on my reel.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:44.820]   Oh, I wish you could see that.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:45.820]   [Laughter]
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:46.820]   Windows Weekly.
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:51.820]   A showmanship A+. We're talking about the new Surface Book.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:55.820]   When they showed a laptop, I think I would have jumped out of my seat and blike y'all.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:56.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:51:01.820]   I think they made a device that was left by anybody. Even like lists Joe over here.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:02.820]   Hey, what?
[01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:03.820]   [Laughter]
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:04.820]   Home Theater Geeks.
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:07.820]   This week's guest geek is Ricky Far.
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:14.820]   The story of your father and how that got you sort of into the whole music business is quite fascinating.
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:22.820]   I'm waiting to order my chili dog and I suddenly hear this voice behind me go, "Oh, I know who you are. You're the box's boy."
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:29.820]   I'm John Lennon. I'm with the Beatles over at the Indirect Club. He says, "Come on over. I found my drug of choice." And it was the music.
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:36.820]   Security now.
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:47.820]   Why Fatch? It behaves just like a worm. It hardens the security of its host devices. It will retroactively remove any pre-existing malware that it finds the do-gooder vigilante worm.
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:48.820]   It's quite a Robin Hood.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:49.820]   To it.
[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:51.820]   Making the world safe for technology.
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:56.820]   If you missed that interview Scott Wilkett's in head with Ricky Far. He's the guy who produced the Isle of White Festival.
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.820]   He does impressions. It's amazing.
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:07.820]   If you're a fan of Jimi Hendrix and the Who and the Beatles, you've got to watch it. It was an amazing home theater geek.
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:09.820]   Twitter.tv/htg.
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:14.820]   Tomorrow on Triangulation, the founder of F-Secure Security Guru, Miko Hippenen.
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:19.820]   He is an amazing guy who's been covering this scene for years.
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:27.820]   For years I recommended Eftis going back to the early 90s as the antivirus of choice. He really will have a lot to say.
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:33.820]   And if you missed the new screensavers yesterday, we had the creator of Toron, Paul Cyberson.
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:36.820]   And he's going to come back and do a full triangulation with us.
[01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:42.820]   Next week, I already did the interview. Some of you saw Danny Boyle, the director of the new Steve Jobs movie.
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:47.820]   We'll join us on the new screensaver. So a lot of good stuff coming up.
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:52.820]   Our show today brought to you by BrainTree Mobile App Developers. I got something for you.
[01:52:52.820 --> 01:53:04.820]   If you have to get a payments API into your app or your website and your rack and your brains, look no farther than BrainTree.
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:11.820]   BrainTreePayments.com. With a few lines of code, I mean literally ten lines of code, you will be ready to accept Apple Pay and Pay.
[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:15.820]   Apple Pay and Android Pay PayPal, Venmo credit cards, even Bitcoin.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:20.820]   And when new technologies come along, you just go to your control panel and you check the box and there it is.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:27.820]   They do it all for you. It's secure. They have great fraud protection, fast payouts to you.
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:34.820]   And your customers are going to love it. I mean you don't have to go much farther than the references they provide.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:40.820]   BrainTree payments are used by Uber and Lyft. I mean that's what makes Uber awesome is the payment system.
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:46.820]   Uber and Lyft competitors, they use it. Both of them. Hotels tonight and Airbnb. They use BrainTree.
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:50.820]   GitHub uses BrainTree. It's really the best solution.
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:58.820]   Maybe you've seen the one touch SDK that gets you. This is what Uber uses.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:05.820]   You don't have to even do a checkout. You know what? I did an interview with the general manager for BrainTree Mobile.
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:12.820]   His name is Anker Arya. And he talked a little bit about this. The next big thing for online retailers.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:24.820]   Contextual commerce is bringing the buying experience inside of a news feed or a consumer platform and not requiring the consumer to have to click away to a merchant's website to complete a purchase.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:32.820]   So it's really taking all of the really good demographic data and allowing consumers to buy where they're comfortable discovering things.
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:37.820]   So the same way that consumers love to do a one-click buying experience with Uber, Airbnb.
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:42.820]   They're going to want to do that experience with some of these big consumer platforms that they're highly engaged with.
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:47.820]   I think this is a technology from Harper Reads company that BrainTree just recently acquired.
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:52.820]   Anyway, modest. Was it modest? I think it was a name of it. No matter what you're selling, BrainTree is awesome.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:55:01.820]   Fast payouts, continuous support from your first dollar to your billions. You'll see fewer abandoned carts and more sales with BrainTree's best-in-class mobile checkout experience.
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:08.820]   Have I convinced you? How about this? Your first $50,000 in transactions fee free.
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:16.820]   Find out more braintreatpayments.com/twit. Look no farther. You have found true payment nirvana.
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:23.820]   Braintreatpayments.com/twit.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:30.820]   I'm just going to read the headline. You guys can comment. BlackBerry CEO wants to sell 5 million phones a year.
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:37.820]   Good luck with that, too. You know you can say it all you want.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:48.820]   John Chen told the Verge's goal is 5 million smartphones a year, but this is the second part of that sentence, which will be necessary to make the business profitable.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:55.820]   If that doesn't happen, Chen hinted BlackBerry may exit the handset business altogether.
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:58.820]   It sounded a bit more serious though. I'll go ahead.
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:10.820]   It reminded me of Donald Trump talking about why he might get out of the presidential race, because Chen was talking about the scenarios under what BlackBerry would get out, which is the first thing you do before you decide to get out.
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:13.820]   Yeah. I mean he's already thinking about it, right? He's already got a number.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:19.820]   They've always insisted that making an Android phone isn't going to be profitable enough to stay in the business.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:20.820]   And that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:22.820]   Now it's their last best hope, right?
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:28.820]   Well, they should have done it two years ago when they still had people who are customers and still had a lot of brand value.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:31.820]   There are still people I see on planes with BlackBerrys.
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:32.820]   Oh sure.
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:42.820]   Are they going to be willing to give up their BlackBerry and be the last people on Earth who haven't joined iPhone or Android and jump over to Android?
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:43.820]   I don't know.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:44.820]   They know that's the...
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:45.820]   They're smart.
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:50.820]   So this is the new Android phone from BlackBerry. It's called the "Priv" or the "Prive".
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:51.820]   Pivv.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:52.820]   Okay.
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:55.820]   But it's the first sellable of private.
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:03.820]   And even almost reminds me a little bit of a black phone or some of these other phones that are kind of aimed at being secure.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:08.820]   At least BlackBerry has some history and tradition of that.
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.820]   So they could be credible that they might.
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:16.820]   And as you say, Robert, there are a lot of business and government people who still believe in BlackBerry.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:20.820]   They're currently on a pace to sell about 3 million phones a year.
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:22.820]   So it's not maybe such a stretch to say five.
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:31.820]   But it's not... I mean, even if they did do well in Android, it's not so clear that being in the Android phone business is a great idea these days either.
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:34.820]   It's a race to the bottom. It's like being in the PC business.
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:39.820]   Maybe there's some scenario under which they somehow are able to charge enough that there's an attractive profit in there.
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:40.820]   But it seems unlike that.
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:42.820]   100, I think, is what I heard.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:43.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:49.820]   Interestingly, you talked on your commercial about developers, though. We haven't talked about Amazon at all.
[01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:52.820]   What do you want to say about Amazon, big boy?
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:58.820]   The hot news was the IoT Internet of Things API and SDK that they came out with.
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:03.820]   I think Amazon doesn't get enough credit for being a disruptive business, do they?
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:04.820]   Yeah.
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:07.820]   They look like a retailer.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:09.820]   They're so not a retailer.
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:12.820]   When I speak, I talk about Amazon Echo.
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:19.820]   And it's really interesting that usually it's only about 1% of the audience who has an Echo, but everybody loves it.
[01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:21.820]   Do you have any of those?
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:29.820]   Yeah, I do. We've been around long enough, haven't we, Harry and Robert and Georgia, to know that when everybody is talking about something, there's something going on.
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:34.820]   It happened with the Palm. It happened with the Tivo. It's not a guarantee to success.
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:36.820]   It just means that there's something exciting.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:37.820]   Do you have an Echo?
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:44.820]   I do. I think Amazon has been pretty clever about how they rolled out. It's the opposite of the Fire Phone, where they held a huge press event and bragged about it.
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:51.820]   With the Echo, they rolled it out quietly. I'm still more excited about the potential of Echo than the actual device, but I definitely think there is something there.
[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:53.820]   What do you use it for, Harry?
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:56.820]   I use it for listening to podcasts and music a lot.
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:59.820]   So you say Alexa, listen to you on Twitter.
[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:00.820]   It's great for podcasts.
[01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:01.820]   You use it as an alarm clock.
[01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:05.820]   Yeah, it's great for Twitch. You can listen to it live. You say exactly that.
[01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:08.820]   I won't say her name, but Echo listened to Twitch live.
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.820]   I use it a lot with TuneIn.
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:11.820]   Not TuneIn.
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:14.820]   We can turn on everybody's Echo in the world. Alexa!
[01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:19.820]   Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:23.820]   There's one flaw. They need to have more than two names for that.
[01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:25.820]   I've been begging for this.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:29.820]   Same thing with the okay, you know who and hey, you know who.
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:31.820]   Every one of these phones should allow you to customize this phrase.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:36.820]   Moto-roll is the only company that ever did that, but I should be able to have my own phrases.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:40.820]   Let's go back to the developer story because that fits in here.
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:46.820]   They have become the default for innovation on the cloud.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:49.820]   Fire the entire fire team.
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:54.820]   What is it? 829 or whatever they were.
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:55.820]   899.
[01:59:55.820 --> 02:00:01.820]   I'm...
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:05.820]   But if you visit a startup and you ask them, what have you built on?
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:09.820]   Instagram is on top of AWS Flipriz.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:13.820]   New Bank is on top of AWS.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:17.820]   And that's why we've announced a deal with Amazon as well.
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:19.820]   So, at Rackspace.
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:20.820]   Oh, really?
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.820]   Yeah, we're now providing support for...
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:24.820]   They're a direct competitor, aren't they?
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:26.820]   That's why I want to talk about it now.
[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:28.820]   Yeah, you're talking about Amazon Web Services, which you're right.
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:29.820]   Everybody runs on.
[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:34.820]   In fact, again, this is an example of how Amazon in a stealth way is a disruptor.
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:41.820]   By making Amazon Web Services, they really made it possible for anybody to create an app startup or a web startup.
[02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:49.820]   Because in the past, I remember when Kevin Rose started Dig, he had to buy a colo space and he had to buy servers and he had to set up servers.
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:50.820]   It was a lot of money.
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:52.820]   And it was complicated.
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:58.820]   Now you just spin up an Amazon Web Services instance and you've got a proof of concept to all the way up to a full-scale service.
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:02.820]   We've got to be good for AWS, by the way.
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:09.820]   You're going to see us provide support for AWS, Azure, and our own cloud.
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:12.820]   That's a smart way to go, actually, for Rackspace.
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:18.820]   Yeah, because let's be honest, we couldn't keep up with the innovation that Amazon was investing in.
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:23.820]   They just had way more engineers than we could ever afford.
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:29.820]   It's a billion dollar business on 6 billion in sales.
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:31.820]   I mean, they really know what they're doing there.
[02:01:31.820 --> 02:01:33.820]   But they're not good at service.
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:41.820]   I was hanging out with the geek who built Coachella's sensor network and their badge system.
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:42.820]   And it's all built on AWS.
[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:46.820]   And he was having a lot of trouble even getting through to their teams.
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:49.820]   Does a Google drive down on Friday?
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:50.820]   Yes.
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:51.820]   Google Docs were.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:52.820]   I guess Google Drive.
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:53.820]   Google Drive.
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:54.820]   Yeah.
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:57.820]   So that's the other thing is when you hear stories like that, it's scary people.
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:01:59.820]   Because if Google can't keep their servers up.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:06.820]   Yeah, we, at Fast Company, we do a lot of our keeping track of our stories in a Google spreadsheet, which we briefly could not get to.
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:08.820]   That's scary.
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:09.820]   Yep.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:13.820]   If Devorak, we're here to say, "I told you so. Cloud. Bad idea."
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:17.820]   Well, you know, holding your servers down in your basements a bad idea too.
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:19.820]   They can go down there too.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:21.820]   They can go down everywhere, I guess.
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:22.820]   Absolutely.
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:31.820]   And the chances that you have a nerd, you know, keeping them up to date and keeping them, you know, watching them, make sure they're not too hot or the hard drives aren't burning out.
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:33.820]   And so a whole whole other thing.
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:36.820]   Amazon, for a long time, has been talking about making a pay TV service.
[02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:40.820]   They're apparently added again, according to sources with Bloomberg Business Week.
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:47.820]   They've reached out to CBS and NBC about carrying their channels on an online pay TV service.
[02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:50.820]   A cord-cutter's dream.
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:56.820]   Doesn't mean they're going to make those deals because a lot of people, like a couple of
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:59.820]   Cubby-called Apple, have been trying to make those deals for a long, long time.
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:04.820]   And the networks are understandably a little slow to embrace this.
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:12.820]   Dan Rayburn, we've talked to him on the show before he does the streaming media blog, said that content owners were approached by the company.
[02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:14.820]   I didn't know this.
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:15.820]   Did you know this, John?
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:17.820]   Amazon bought Elemental.
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:30.820]   So the streaming hardware that we use, because Kelly told us to buy it, when you watch our live streams there, it's encoded by something called an Elemental.
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:32.820]   It didn't know this, but Amazon bought them.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:34.820]   Did you know that?
[02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:35.820]   Oh, they knew that.
[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:40.820]   Why don't you tell me?
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:45.820]   So that's an interesting business for them to get into.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:51.820]   And they have A.W.S. for I.O.T., which is what I know you were talking about, Robert.
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:54.820]   Tell me what that means.
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:04:05.820]   So if you're a company like Union Pacific, you're putting sensors underneath the rails to watch, to listen to the trains going overhead.
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:16.820]   If you're a company like Canaloupe in San Francisco, you're putting a package inside vending machines that's going to talk to the Internet.
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:26.820]   And you're going to use this new A.W.S.I.O.T. SDK to glue it all together and do new things with all those sensors that are around.
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:32.820]   So it's kind of like Amazon Web Services for the web, but only instead for these little devices.
[02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:33.820]   Yeah, so think about it.
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:36.820]   Make it easier to create an I.O.T. device.
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:44.820]   Now Nest is on Google's or on Alphabet, but let's say you're building a new thing to build a new kind of desk with a sensor.
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:53.820]   For instance, you're going to use this SDK to hook the sensors in the desk to the cloud and so you can do stuff on the cloud.
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:05:02.820]   Kind of spit up my coffee a little bit when I read yesterday, or maybe it was on Friday, that LastPass was acquired by LogMeIn.
[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:04.820]   I love LastPass.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.820]   I know many geeks use it.
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:09.820]   We use the enterprise version for our business.
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:11.820]   It's a password fault.
[02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:13.820]   I use it too.
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:18.820]   TechCrunch said $110 million to Joe Seagrist and the company.
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:27.820]   Joe was really pretty much, I mean, created LastPass himself and ran a very reliable and secure service that a lot of geeks trusted.
[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:34.820]   I especially trusted it after Steve Gibson took a look at it, talked with Joe, looked at the source code.
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:38.820]   Joe was very kind to let him look at the source code and gave it thumbs up.
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:44.820]   LogMeIn, I'm not so sure I trust them as much as I do LastPass.
[02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:48.820]   So I don't know what do you guys do.
[02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:58.820]   Keep in mind, LogMeIn is a pretty cool system that you can share your Mac or your PC and get into it from your other devices.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:00.820]   So that requires a lot of trust as well.
[02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:06.820]   There are remote access companies. I know a lot of people who have been unhappy with how LogMeIn has run the service.
[02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:10.820]   They had a free version which people recommended for a long time, killed that.
[02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:15.820]   They apparently still have considerable number of bugs that people have been complaining about.
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:26.820]   But most importantly, the history of LogMeIn and Hamachi is not another acquisition that they basically killed worries me a little bit.
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:35.820]   Just in general, it does a useful reminder that if you entrust somebody who is something as important as keeping your account safe,
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:37.820]   you don't know what's going to happen to them.
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:40.820]   Better they be acquired than they go away.
[02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:41.820]   Right.
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:47.820]   But maybe best of all, they keep on doing what they're doing, especially if you entrust them because you like the people running it.
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:48.820]   Right.
[02:06:48.820 --> 02:06:50.820]   Yeah, it's a challenge.
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:53.820]   There are other choices. What do you use for a password fault?
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:56.820]   I know I jump out around a lot because I like to know what's going on there.
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:57.820]   Smart.
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:00.820]   I've tried all of them. I've tried a dash lane.
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:04.820]   My problem is, you know, I kind of get invested in one. I've got hundreds of passwords in LastPass.
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:08.820]   One password, dash lane, robo form AI.
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:11.820]   The one I usually use is one password.
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:15.820]   Key Pass is open source but doesn't have the flexibility. What do you use, Georgia?
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:17.820]   I use one password or my brain.
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:18.820]   So...
[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:20.820]   Your brain is the thing you should not use.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:27.820]   I really shouldn't use it because I will forget my password to absolutely everything when password is happy.
[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:31.820]   It keeps everything there for me because there's too many passwords to use.
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:35.820]   Or I'll end up using the same password for everything, which is a horrible, horrible idea.
[02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:36.820]   Yep.
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:42.820]   Every basic issue, I do a lot of stuff on mobile devices where it's a lot harder for any of these services to be as good as they can be.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:44.820]   But LastPass solves that.
[02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:52.820]   Now, they solve it with a little bit of... It raises a little bit of an issue because in order for them to solve that, they have to store your passwords.
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:59.820]   Now, you encrypt it with your passphrase and only you know that. They say they can't decrypt it and I believe that's true.
[02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:02.820]   Steve seems to verify that.
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:09.820]   But that is certainly a point of failure because if somebody can get, and there was some concern that maybe they did get,
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:15.820]   the password vault stored on LastPass's servers, they could use brute force to bang at them until they got it.
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:18.820]   And of course, somebody gets your password vault, you're dead in the water.
[02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:21.820]   That is the worst possible scenario.
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:26.820]   Now, log me in has my password vault. I think for the time being, I'll continue to trust them.
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:28.820]   But it's time to maybe start looking at some alternatives.
[02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:32.820]   I'm sure Steve will be doing that on security now on Tuesday.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:38.820]   I don't know what else to say about it, but...
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.820]   Yeah, these things happen.
[02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:45.820]   But it's the same thing with Radio Shack went bankrupt. They sold the Radio Shack customer database.
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:52.820]   Now, you may have agreed to the privacy statement at Radio Shack.com or when you joined the Battery Club, but now somebody else has got it.
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:54.820]   What's their privacy rule?
[02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:59.820]   Luckily, I don't no longer have any other same information I did when I was a big member of the Battery Club.
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:08.820]   This is good news. Computer science is now the top major for women at Stanford.
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:12.820]   Maybe we're going to finally break this glass ceiling.
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:14.820]   I hope so.
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:16.820]   Yeah, it's awfully lonely here.
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:19.820]   214 men women are majoring in computer science.
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:21.820]   That's 30% of the majors in that department.
[02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:23.820]   So still not a majority.
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:28.820]   Human biology, which had been the most popular for women, slipped to second place with 208.
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:34.820]   But women are about 30% of the comp-sign majors at Stanford.
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:36.820]   Better. It's improving, for sure.
[02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:37.820]   Better.
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:39.820]   We're still a far ways off.
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:40.820]   Better.
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:45.820]   Change is slow. Change is slow when it used to be a field where women kind of felt excluded.
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:50.820]   Like, if you don't see other people in the job, you actually don't think that that's something you can do.
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:52.820]   We're mimics by nature.
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:10:01.820]   So, by bringing your girls, giving them bits box so they can learn how to code, bringing them to work, that type of thing, and in media and on shows.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:06.820]   Having more women visible in technology will help them know that they're a place there for them as well.
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:10.820]   Very nice. We're done.
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:12.820]   You guys rock.
[02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.820]   George and Dao, what you're writing for? What you're writing about for iMoor.com right now.
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:22.820]   I haven't written anything in a little while. I'm busy writing.
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:27.820]   I'm doing a conference on the 21st and 23rd in Indianapolis.
[02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:31.820]   So, I've been, yes, it's going to be on flow states with applications.
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:35.820]   It's a developers conference and tickets are on sale until the 13th.
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:44.820]   So, I'm busy doing that right now and trying to get all of my slides and make sure that everything flows well into itself.
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:49.820]   So, I'm going to deal with the psychology of applications and how to make a better app.
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:54.820]   I love that. Flow. App should flow. You should be in a flow state.
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:57.820]   We should. Those are the best applications.
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:03.820]   I love you because you cover both anxiety and flow states. You got both ends of your specks.
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:13.820]   Yes. Yes. I'm also doing a sleep. I did a special series for a sleep, which is, I think, one of the number one issues that I see coming up are people are not sleeping as well as they should.
[02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:17.820]   I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
[02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:22.820]   I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:27.820]   I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
[02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:30.820]   I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:33.820]   I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:36.820]   I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:39.820]   I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.

[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:05.820]   I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:10.820]   I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.

[02:13:04.820 --> 02:13:07.820]   Thank you, Harry. It's always great to have you. It's great to be here. Thank you so much.
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:13.820]   Of course, the scobalizer, my old friend, Robert Scobel. I've known you as long as I've known anybody in tech.
[02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:21.820]   We started working together in the early '90s. Yeah. When you were on KGO radio. It's awesome.
[02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:27.820]   You're doing so great. I'm so proud of you. I just feel like you are on a roll.
[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:31.820]   The second half of your century is going to be really good.
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:36.820]   Yeah. So far, it's going good. Last week was amazing getting to see that camera and everything else.
[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:41.820]   Yeah. Nice. Tomorrow, I'm speaking a bunch of Swedish entrepreneurs.
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:47.820]   Really? Kick off the week to it. Awesome. You're going to talk like the Swedish chef and do this.
[02:13:47.820 --> 02:13:51.820]   Yeah. For a different year. Oh, it seems a close one. No, don't insult him.
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:55.820]   Hey, thank you, everybody. That's my job. I'm glad you were here today. We always have fun.
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:14:01.820]   And if you would like to join us each and every week, best time to come by 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:06.820]   2,200 UTC. That's when we do Twitch on Sunday afternoon.
[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:11.820]   If you can't watch live though, on-demand video, always available for all of our shows at Twitch.tv.
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:18.820]   Little program note. When I was setting up that Squarespace site, I kind of changed the DNS for LeoVille.tv.
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:29.820]   And it turns out somehow that I don't understand, we used to in the old days, we used LeoVille.tv/podcasts as the podcast URL.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:34.820]   We've long ago abandoned that. The podcast URL is now feeds.tweet.tv.
[02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:40.820]   But apparently, maybe it's not just, maybe it's somehow iTunes has the old feeds in some cases.
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:44.820]   Maybe not in the U.S. maybe in Mexico. I don't know.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:49.820]   But if all of a sudden you see there's no podcast feed anymore,
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:55.820]   resubscribe and make sure you're resubscribing to feeds.tweet.tv, not LeoVille.tv.
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:15:03.820]   And I guess what I'm going to do is I'm going to go change the domain server and fix it and put it back to the way it used to be
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:09.820]   until we figure out why that happened. That's like from the old days of Twitch.
[02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:14.820]   That's when the feeds run my server.
[02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:19.820]   I don't know what happened. So don't subscribe to LeoVille.tv/podcasts anymore.
[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:24.820]   Do subscribe so you get every podcast whenever they're available right away.
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:28.820]   That's the whole point of those feeds. If you'd like to be in studio with us, oh, we'd love to have you.
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:31.820]   It's a great studio audience today. Thank you all for being here.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:36.820]   You just have to email tickets@twit.tv, so we'll put a chair out for you.
[02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:41.820]   And I guess that's, is there anything else, Jason Howell?
[02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:45.820]   Besides thanking you are fine producer for the job you do each and every day.
[02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:50.820]   I will accept that. And I think that was about it. That's all I was waiting for.
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:53.820]   Was that? Thank you.
[02:15:53.820 --> 02:15:56.820]   Jason's really too good to be the producer of the show.
[02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:58.820]   He hosts a wonderful show called All About Android.
[02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:01.820]   It is a must watch every Tuesday evening at 5 p.m.
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:03.820]   But we just love having them around.
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:06.820]   So the more I can get, the better I am.
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:08.820]   Thank you everybody for being here. We'll see you next time.
[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:10.820]   Another Twit! Is it the K?
