[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.960]   And what's the future hold for streaming media? CNN+ goes buy-by and record time. We're going to
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.920]   try to find something that folded faster. Google's new Pixel Smartwatch. Is it real or just a rumor
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.280]   and should you buy an NFT? Hmm, maybe not. It's all coming up next. On Tweth.

[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.600]   week's Tech News got a great panel assembled for you. Let's say hello to Elisa Edicico.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.080]   She is a senior editor at CNET. Hello, Lacey. I haven't seen you in a long time. Welcome back.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.160]   Yeah, thank you for having me. It's great to be back. I missed you. I'm so glad you're here.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.040]   Yeah. What do you cover at CNET? A lot of things, but mostly mobile devices, so phones, smartwatches,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.920]   things like that. Occasionally I write about other things too. There is a smartwatch story
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.680]   in the rundown. We'll get to that in just a little bit. Also with us from the UK, Nate Langson.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.480]   He is a Bloomberg tech editor. Does the UK tech show as well? And for some reason has a massive
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.320]   drum kit behind him. We've never yet got him to play on it, but hello, Nate. It's good to have you.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.120]   Hi. Thanks for having me. Yeah. One day it will happen. One day, I promise.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.440]   I think Twit, like any good rock and roll show, should have a 20-minute drum break.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.760]   Absolutely. I mean, if you want a 20-minute drum break, then...
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.120]   We'll wander off, go play cards, have a drink, and you want to lose all your listeners and
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.240]   responses. I'll put some death knuckles for 20 minutes. I love it. I think we'd only gain listeners.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.560]   Also with us, it's great to have him from the Vatican, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.120]   Father Robert Ballisair, the digital Jesuit. Belated Easter. Happy Easter to you. I bet you
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.800]   were fairly busy last Sunday. It was a busy, busy week. And of course, I am the senior tech
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.160]   editor for Vatican Tech News. We cover all the latest technologies. Yes. Running water, toilets,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.120]   clay pot, stuff like that. Oh, there's been breakthroughs in the clay potage of late.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.480]   Lots to talk about with Father Robert. I guess a big story of the week really is a twofold
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.160]   story all about the story of streaming and what the hell is happening with it. First thing happens,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:29.760]   Netflix in their Q1 financials revealed that for the first time ever, they lost subscribers.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.200]   A couple of hundred thousand subscribers versus two and a half million expected.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.480]   And of course, it's the first time ever. They've gained every year since they were founded,
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.720]   I think. Immediately, the market reacted by killing Netflix value by almost a third.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.840]   It might be more than a third by now. A huge plummet. And I guess the feeling is,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   this is the beginning of the end for Netflix, which kind of surprises me. Netflix response
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.400]   is, well, we're looking at ad supported programming, which would definitely kill Netflix.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.480]   Tins are wrong way to go. Netflix claimed the, there are a couple of things that clearly make
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.760]   a difference. The broad variety of streamers now, you have many, many choices.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.200]   Disney plus Peacock Hulu. Netflix is just one of them. You also have,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.240]   so you have competition for them, but they've also been hurting Netflix by pulling back
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.680]   on the programs they own. Peacock pulled out the office. Disney pulled out Marvel's content.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.080]   So Netflix is losing a lot of its catalog to the competition. And then their answer,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.720]   which was a good answer was to make original programming, but they spent $13 billion
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.000]   last year on original programming. And it's kind of hard to imagine that that's a sustainable
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.760]   strategy. So Netflix in trouble, and this affects you too, Nate. Netflix is big in the UK.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.960]   It's big, but actually one of the things we were looking at this week is how subscriber numbers
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.840]   to all streaming services are really going down in Britain. And a lot of people are wondering,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.920]   why is this happening in particular in the UK? And a lot of people are looking at the cost of
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.480]   energy in Britain, which went up by about 50% in April, which doesn't sound like it would
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.000]   necessarily impact streaming directly. But most households in the UK had their energy bills sort
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.800]   of go up by 50% literally overnight, and they're going to go up again in October by a similar amount.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   So one of the first things I think people have been looking at is, well, do we need this many
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.600]   subscriptions? Do we need Netflix and Disney plus and Apple TV and all of these other things that we
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.480]   have? And I think a lot of the answers now is, well, no, we don't. And I don't necessarily think it
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.440]   dooms Netflix because the numbers are still enormous. We're still talking hundreds of millions of
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.400]   subscribers, but it's definitely a concern. And as you noted with the share price, which is
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.720]   something that we look at a lot, obviously at Bloomberg, it started the year at something like
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.360]   600 and it closed on Friday at about 200. So it's just absolutely annihilated and a lot of very
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.280]   prominent investors have lost money and notably lost money by selling at this loss. And actually
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.160]   saying, you know what, we don't think this is going to get any better. So we're going to
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.440]   counter losses, get out now. And some people are saying that that was a smart move. But
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.000]   it must be deeply challenging, particularly when you look at the wider market and the fact that
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.560]   streaming is growing. It's a sign that Netflix just cannot keep all these people to itself anymore,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.480]   at least not consistently. Bill Ackman is one of the investors. He's a lead at Pershing Square.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.120]   He got into Netflix just a few months ago. Whoops, in January, about 3.1 million shares.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:02.640]   Shares have fallen 60% since then. He sold all those shares netting a $400 million loss. Yikes.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.960]   Yeah, that's the that's the chat. But somebody like that will only do that if he says, look,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.280]   there's only downside here. I see no upside. This is the this is the thing. And a lot of people,
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.680]   you know, particularly retail investors will talk about, you know, by the dip, by the dip. And
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.840]   there's a lot of logic in that a lot of the time. But when something so disastrous comes along as
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.640]   what happened this week with Netflix's figures and the forecaster lose even more subscribers,
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.920]   then the smart money sometimes is on, well, if you're going to lose something, lose the least
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.440]   amount possible. And that at least seems to be Ackman's strategy here, whether or not that
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.400]   will continue. Who knows? Maybe this is an even bigger dip to buy.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:51.440]   And Netflix has three C's that are a problem. You've got cost, you've got competition,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.280]   and you've got content. Now, cost and competition, those are. Did you just make that up? I just made
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.960]   that up. That's really good. But that's exactly the three problems. Yeah.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.240]   Yeah, exactly. Because the first two you can fix, you can price your service better to be more
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.280]   competitive. But the problem is content. And this is where it becomes a long term issue for Netflix.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.720]   Amazon and Disney, which are number two and three are fine. They've got plenty of content that
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.160]   is actually pretty dang good. Amazon just bought an entire catalog from Paramount. And Disney is
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.640]   never going to be running out of content in the next 15 or so years. But when you start looking at
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.720]   how Netflix has been stocking up its content, it's with, pardon my French crap, it's horrible,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.560]   horrible stuff. It's a lot of programs that nobody. They have some successful movies. They were
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:47.120]   able to lure Scorsese over and make a three hour film called The Irishman. They almost
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.160]   want to ask her for Roma two years ago. They have some very successful streaming original.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.280]   And that's great. But it only means I have to subscribe one month out of the year.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.880]   I can binge everything I want to watch on Netflix in one month. And then I'm done. So, you know,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.320]   where I am right now is I almost don't want to steal the password for Netflix for one of my friends.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.480]   Do you have Netflix? I have Netflix. I'm not paying Netflix.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.760]   So you left out, there's three C's, but there's also an R. It's like Cretan's Clearwater, CCR.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.040]   CCCR, which is revenue. And that's one of the things Netflix is trying to do.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:33.120]   Go after password sharing. They claim 100 million people are using Netflix with a shared password.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.560]   I meant my kids who had my password when they lived with me. They were part of my household.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.000]   When they moved out, I didn't change the password on them. So they're still watching Netflix.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.080]   But I have to say, I don't think those 100 million people are necessarily all going to become
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.000]   subscribers. I do like Netflix. A parent plan. They're trying this already in Central and South
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.640]   America is to instead of saying we're going to cut these people off, they're just going to charge you
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.320]   a couple extra bucks a month for the other people. So it's very likely the dad who's paying for the
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.440]   Henry and Abby will pay a couple extra bucks a month for each of them. Then have to make the phone
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.120]   call and saying I'm cutting off your Netflix kids. Get your own account. What do you think
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.320]   Lisa? Is Netflix worth? Is it 12 bucks a month now?
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.760]   I think it's hard because I think it goes back to what we were just talking about. It's all about
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:34.240]   the content. And I think if Netflix does start charging more to have more people on their account,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.080]   just like you were talking about what they're piloting right now in some locations,
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.760]   I think this is going to be a big test for Netflix. I think we're going to figure out
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.720]   how crucial is it really to people? Are they willing to pay more? I think you'll have a lot
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.160]   of those conversations of like you're saying, dad might call you up and say, hey, are you using
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.200]   Netflix? Do I need to upgrade or can I just cut you out? That's a good way. Thank you for giving me
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.400]   the wording. Hey, are you using it still? Yeah, exactly. I could see that happening a lot.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.800]   But I do think the competition is a big part of it. Netflix was comfortable for a long time because
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.160]   they were really the first to popularize streaming. They were also one of the first to have really
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.920]   good original shows like House of Cards. But they obviously can't just keep doing the same things
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.760]   anymore because the competition has changed so much. I think that's what the market is saying.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.600]   Not so much that it's over for Netflix, but that the heyday of streaming is over. I mean,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.960]   we certainly we had two very good years during COVID. Maybe they're feeling like, well, okay,
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.320]   but people aren't going to be staying home anymore anymore. And they're not going to be
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.680]   paying because times are tight with the recession and inflation. They're maybe not going to want to
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.640]   pay that extra subscription. What's the first one to go? That's the real question. Yeah, it's true.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.000]   Well, I also think people sign up for one show and then they cancel just like we were talking
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.680]   about before. So I think that's part of it too. I think to really keep people in, they just need
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   to have a really good catalog of good shows like Netflix is kind of like a cable replacement,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.680]   right? People don't usually sign up to watch just one show and then quit. I feel like that's
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.160]   something that you see more with maybe Showtime or some of these other streamers that were a
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.880]   little bit later to the game. But I think if Netflix really wants to keep subscribers from just
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.760]   having that be the first one off the chopping block, they need to just make sure they have a
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.680]   really big back catalog of stuff that can essentially fill that cable hole for a lot of people.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.600]   You know, I'm at the start. No Leo might have looked at the top 10 shows on Netflix in the US.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.960]   It's always a bad sign when a network goes to reality programming, right? That's cheap.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:53.520]   And it's usually a kind of drive to the bottom. Number one selling sunset. Number two,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.080]   conversations with a killer, the John Wayne Gacy tapes. I don't know. I think the Mark Tardis
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.920]   fiction, Anatomy of a Scanner probably fiction, Bridgerton. Well, Bridgerton is just hot. And the
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.640]   ultimatum, I don't I don't I don't watch it. The ultimatum, Mary or move on. Number six,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.960]   these, this is kind of looks like a bad sign. I am a boss. Huh?
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   Somebody say something? Oh, I think that was my Netflix that for some reason,
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:31.920]   true here. I was trying to find what the what the popular equivalents in the UK were. I didn't.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.600]   Oh, yeah. This is a this is a what are they called? It's carousel. I haven't seen before.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.080]   The top 10 shows in the US today. The top the top ones here are actually fairly similar in the UK.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.760]   Yeah. Selling sunset, Anatomy of a scandal, John Wayne,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:55.120]   hot stopper, Bridgerton. Yeah. Missing. Yeah. Yeah. Netflix can fix this. How?
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:01.040]   All they have to do is move to a metered plan, $5 a month, 40 hours of programming.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.400]   No one's going to share it if you're going to be using up your hour. That's an interesting idea.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.120]   And then it's less. So maybe you won't get rid of it. And you could probably think of five hours
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.080]   to watch. Exactly. And most people like me are going to end up watching more than five hours
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.040]   probably. So yeah. And so you go up to the next level. Next year. Also, Leo, you know, we predicted
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.640]   this 10 years ago back in the early days of Twit in in cord cutters when we were talking about
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.760]   cutting the cord. And we talked about the rise of streaming services. There was a prediction
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.160]   about how all of the studios are going to want to get on on this. They see what Netflix has.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.280]   They're going to want to start their own streaming services. It's going to take a while for them
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.440]   to build their catalogs to build their technology. But eventually we're going to get to the point
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.360]   where people are going to start saying, I don't want to have five or six different
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.200]   subscriptions a month to watch all the programming I want. That's where we are right now.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:55.040]   This this is the calling is over for cord cutting and a caller today in the radio show said,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.640]   I just signed up for cable again. Because I couldn't find the shows I wanted. It was more.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.120]   It was getting more and more expensive. Court cutting no longer saves you money.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.120]   If you include the cost of Internet, it's I think maybe it's the end of court cutting.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:17.280]   Yeah, I think I saw I saw some report that I think said on average people's Americans spend
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.160]   $47 per month on streaming services. I mean, that's like getting into cable territory again.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.880]   So especially when you had the 40 bucks or 50 or 60 in my case for your internet access.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.720]   Now you're at 100 bucks.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.400]   And also if the cable companies are catching up to streaming and are offering more on-demand
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.280]   options and things like that, that allow people to watch what they want instead of just defaulting
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.360]   to whatever happens to be on right now. I feel like, yeah, there is a compelling case for just
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.080]   going back to cable instead of signing up for like, you know, five different streaming services to
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:55.680]   get everything you want. Yeah. Have you seen Samsung TV? I have not. So it's something that I just
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:02.240]   bought my parents a brand new 70 inch TV for their house in Las Vegas. And they're actually,
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.880]   when I first installed it and it took all of information, you know, where we were and
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.040]   what locality we're in, we got access completely free. No subscription to about 3000 channels
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:20.080]   over Samsung TV. Wow. That's free forever, which includes local TV. And they've now cut the cable.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.400]   They don't need anything. They've got everything they want. And they're not paying any subscription
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.440]   fees. Now, you know, I don't. But it's awesome. I don't know if they know, but you know that the
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.400]   reason Samsung does this is because now they are getting marketing information from them.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.600]   Correct. Right. I mean, that's where the revenue stream is, I would guess.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.920]   Absolutely. Yeah. And it tells you at the beginning, it tells you this is exactly what's going to be
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.680]   happening. This is what we use. But I think most people, if you got free locals, sure, I'll do that.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:53.280]   You're going to sell my information back to advertisers. But I don't care if I get free TV.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.480]   That's interesting. Today still Nate forgive me of my ignorance.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.320]   Do you still have to buy a license to watch TV in the UK? Oh, yeah. Oh, you do. Yeah, you do.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:11.280]   Oh, yeah. That's back. It is. I mean, there's a lot. There is a lot of controversy around this
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:17.680]   at the moment because the BBC is, you know, I don't want to say it's having its lunch eaten by the
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.000]   streaming giants, but it's certainly having a lot of its food taken by the streaming giants.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.320]   The BBC license fee in a nutshell, it used to be you paid it. Anyone who had a TV paid the license
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:36.160]   fee and then your TV was free. And bear in mind, that has now moved to the point that it's streaming,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.520]   it's back catalog, it's the BBC news, it's radio, it's podcasts, it's all that other stuff.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.720]   And it is entirely ad free. And that's the thing that makes a big, big difference. Like it is illegal
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.640]   even to show ads. Like you cannot show ads on it. So it's a completely different model. And it does
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.720]   work. And it is actually very, very good value if you're someone who values BBC content.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.760]   But at the same time, there are a lot of people who say it is a tax that shouldn't be paid. It
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:07.040]   should be a subscription model. It should be paid monthly. It should be privatized and it should
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.720]   be made to compete better with the likes of Netflix. But it's withstood that. And a lot of the reason
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.400]   is because it's not just TV. It is a huge wealth of other things as well. And that sort of kept people
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.760]   kind of happy with it for the most part, at least. I feel like at a remove anyway, because,
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.640]   you know, we don't see everything. The BBC is the gold standard for broadcasting, both radio and
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.680]   television. And I would be glad to pay. What's the license fee? How much does it cost?
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.760]   I think I'd have to check. So just renewed it. It renews automatically. It's something like
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.920]   about 140 pounds a year. Oh, that is a lot. That's Netflix territory.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.080]   Well, it's deep. Yeah. I mean, in dollars, that's probably about 180 bucks a year.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.440]   That's more than Netflix. Yeah, it probably is more than Netflix. But it is, it's, you know,
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   it's almost incomparable to Netflix in terms of the subscription and what you get for it,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:06.240]   because it is, you know, you're paying for the newsroom. It funds everything the BBC does.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.000]   And I'm not a BBC apologist. Throw that out there. There's an awful lot I don't like about
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.880]   the BBC does and the way the model is. But, you know, there is a lot of educational stuff that
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.040]   comes with that. There is a lot of, you know, international bureaus full of journalists, which
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:27.600]   obviously as a journalist myself, is something that I know is not cheap and is very, very valuable,
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.400]   particularly, you know, more so now than ever possibly. So, yeah, if you wanted democracy,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.880]   you better damn well have a free now. I don't know how free and independent the BBC is, but you
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.520]   better have a free and independent journalism in your country to report on the
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:48.240]   misa, mis, use of power. Otherwise, you have nobody, you know, you have no idea what's going on.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.280]   And the idea is that it's meant to be, it's meant to be unbiased. It doesn't have a political
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.920]   agenda. A lot of people is there political influence at all on the BBC? I mean, there's
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.000]   political influence in everything, right? You can't get away from it. But the goal is that it is,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.320]   that it doesn't have that influence. Personally, you can never get that right. I just don't think
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.200]   it's possible. And I don't think the BBC gets it right at all. And there is a lot of establishment
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.640]   related problems with the BBC from the top, which is kind of out of step with what a lot of people
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.480]   experience in their day to day lives, as is also the case in politics. So there are parallels that
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.760]   if we're tech supported, though, I think that'd be more of a peril than a license fee, I guess.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.640]   I don't know. A license fee for all intents and purposes is attached. It's a tax. It's, you know,
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:37.920]   it's a legal requirement. But, you know, if you ask most people who would watch a show
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:44.160]   like this, we can tech and who are in the tech world and who are generally pretty familiar with
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.480]   the way that the modern world works, as far as tech and streaming goes, you would not find that
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.280]   many people who think that what the BBC does is bad. But there is a lot to be said for ways
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.840]   it could be brought up to date. Our problem in the United States is all media is corporate.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.320]   And it tends to be owned and increasingly so by oligarchs. And so that's really a problem. And
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.240]   part of the problem that Netflix and streaming and court cutting is having is that the people
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.960]   who distribute the content are increasingly buying the content creators. They are the one in the
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.720]   same, which now means they have a monopoly on the content and its distribution.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.640]   It is not a good system. I, you know, I have to say here in the United States, CNN, which
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.960]   we're going to talk about in a second, has become the Ukraine war porn channel.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:36.160]   It's basically wall to wall Ukraine war. It says if nothing else is happening, I saw not one story
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:43.040]   about Macron's run against Marie Le Pen, for instance, or even salacious stuff like Johnny
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.080]   Depp and Amber Heard. It was all Ukraine all the time. I started to watch BBC World News
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.680]   and you're getting news. So I'm grateful. Thank you for paying your license, face, Nate.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.040]   Well, yeah, I mean, you pay for it in a different way as well, because if you look at some of that
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.360]   BBC America or DVD sales and the license deals that go out.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.760]   That will pay for it. Yeah. Those sorts of things also, they fold in. They're under a different
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:14.480]   arm of the BBC, the BBC worldwide and so on. So there's a lot to be said for what the BBC does
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:20.160]   and I personally would hate for it to go away in any significant way. But there are also ways I'd
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.520]   love to bring it up today. And frankly, you could pay more. I mean, it's been around for decades and
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.400]   decades. And there are so many old programs that are just sitting in vaults and archives somewhere
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.600]   that aren't online. All the old Dr. Who's, they're always the ones that people bring out as an example.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.680]   Like that is an insane and huge back catalogue of extremely valuable IP that if you put all those
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:47.600]   online and said to international audiences, Hey, pay this and you get all of this as well.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.440]   That's going to please license fee payers. I'm sure please. A lot of people who are watching this
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.760]   right now, being able to get, you know, add free very low cost access to a lot of old stuff.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.920]   But you know, you cannot please everyone one size isn't fair to all blah, blah, blah in certain
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:06.320]   metaphor here. But it's interesting compared to Netflix. I should, by the way, clarify, I think
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.040]   the war in Ukraine is extremely important. I'm not saying that it's unimportant. I'm saying we don't
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.080]   need wall to wall coverage. Or I mean, we need coverage and we should have coverage. But there
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:23.760]   are other stories that are also important going on. And dispassionate. Well, it's really clear.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.040]   No, I don't know what you get in Italy, but it's really clear now when I watch CNN that they've
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:35.600]   decided that war is good for ratings. Oh, of course. And just can, you know, there's no news.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.320]   It's just let's keep talking to people in basements and looking at bone up buildings. And
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:46.400]   I don't think it's, you know, at the very least, if you want to cover Ukraine war,
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.560]   let's talk about what's going on and the geopolitics of it. And, you know, I mean,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:56.080]   there's lots more to talk about. CNN is partly this is happening because CNN is currently
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.840]   rudderless. And that's the other streaming story today. CNN Plus, which was launched last
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:09.280]   month with great fanfare and $300 million in marketing has just been shuttered. They gave up,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:19.200]   canceled. It's over. You know, Leo, I never even knew what CNN Plus was. I never heard about CNN Plus.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.120]   So the first time I heard of CNN Plus was when they said it was going to shut down. I was like,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:33.520]   Oh, okay, sure. Why not? So it's a complicated story because it's part of that story of the
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:40.320]   rolling up of content by distributors, AT&T owned Time Warner, which owned HBO and CNN,
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:48.000]   divested of it because they realized we're a phone company. And Discovery bought it. So the
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.040]   problem was that Discovery, I think is not yet running it or they are they just started running it.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:01.680]   And they could not tell Warner, don't launch this. We aren't going to do it. Get it, stop it.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:09.760]   Don't stop that Warner was going to pay spend a billion dollars to get subscribers. But, you know,
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.040]   it's not allowed if you were in the process of acquiring company to tell their company how to
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.800]   be run. So they could say nothing. The day that the merger happened, they said, okay, and by the
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.720]   way, that's CNN Plus that's got to go. It was kind of sad. There are a lot of people who quit
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:34.800]   their job to go to work for CNN Plus, including Chris Wallace. It's quite a stunning, I think,
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.680]   black mark on the reputation of CNN, but also at the same time, CNN Plus didn't have any live news.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.400]   So I think it was destined to die anyway. Apparently, what was happening in Warner,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.680]   we had stories from Axios and others that there were only 10,000 daily active viewers.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:03.200]   The New York Times implies that that was leaked by Warner to TankCNN Plus. I'm not Warner by
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:12.400]   Discovery to TankCNN Plus. It's really quite a soap opera. So it just feels like the streaming
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.000]   world is in quite an uproar this week.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.120]   Yeah, there's the argument that whenever something gets shut down,
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.680]   that, oh, it's embarrassing and it's a black mark because it's been shut down very quickly.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.080]   And obviously, there are other circumstances around this that make it more than just a business
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.000]   decision. You know, it's the victim of a merger. It's probably conflicts of interest,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.240]   not conflicts of interest, but conflicts of preference in management. But often, I think we see when
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.760]   companies shut down a product very quickly, it's often for the best in the long run. And you look
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.480]   back because you look back and you think, well, actually, this was never going to work. So we did
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.840]   well to kill it when it was young. And we take the learning that we did that's still very relevant.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.120]   And we plug that insight, we plug that expertise, we plug that, whatever you've got behind the scenes
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   into the next new property and then get ahead of where you would have been otherwise. We've seen
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.400]   that happen time and time again. I think, to be honest, we kind of saw it in the previous
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.720]   section talking about Netflix and the investor who sold it a loss, like, get out now and maybe
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.280]   you'll be glad you did and cut your losses. Yeah, your losses. This time is where that doesn't make
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.640]   sense. And I did something on my podcast only this this afternoon, comparing this to Microsoft
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.400]   Kin. Do you remember it? Yeah, you know, it launched a whole new phone platform,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.720]   physical, Microsoft, oh, save it. I hope you, I hope you kept it. I don't think I did.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.360]   It was the second one. So it looked a little bit more like a normal phone than the original one.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:50.320]   But but yeah, I loved the idea of it, but it crashed all the time. Yeah. It really was. And I went
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.080]   to the launch for that in San Francisco and they killed it within a few weeks. And actually,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.920]   if you look back, that was probably a very good decision. It didn't help Windows Phone. It didn't
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.240]   help the Nokia stuff that came afterwards. But at the time, it was probably never going to succeed
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.160]   long term. And so they just killed it and said, right? You know what? Forget it. It's not bother.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.120]   Probably a good decision. Maybe this was to 48 days. It died in 48 days.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.680]   So I think the Kin actually lasted a little longer than CNN plus.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.560]   It was like it lasted three scaramoches.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:28.960]   So I mean, that's not bad. We, you know, I've always said that we are in a complicated
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.160]   traditional transitional period between the days when you had three networks on your television.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:43.920]   And you turn the dial ABC, CBS and NBC into this, you know, infinite number of streaming channels.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.640]   And it's there's a lot of uproar and shift and change going on. And we're just seeing that,
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:54.800]   I think very clearly and very dramatically. What do consumers want? What do we want? What would be
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.120]   Lisa? What would be the perfect thing from our point of view?
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:06.240]   Honestly, just having a lot of content that's really good, that's not that expensive. And I
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.560]   think that's what Netflix did well for a long time. Do you want to buy individual shows or do you
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:17.120]   want to buy a channel or? I mean, I think in a dream world, there would be one service that just
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.840]   has everything. But we obviously know that's not going to happen because of, you know,
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.720]   ownership and rights and all of these other things. It's just not going to happen. But,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.640]   but yeah, I do like the idea of having, you know, maybe three or fewer services that just have
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   everything that you need. It just gets so complicated. That is, I, yeah, let's go back like maybe
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:45.120]   seven years ago or five years ago or whoever long. But I, you know, all of this does, I do feel
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.840]   terrible for all the people that, you know, went over to CNN plus a lot of people put their jobs.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.160]   Yeah. I do feel like this is kind of a turning point for the streaming wars. And I do think
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.600]   if there are new services in the future, it is going to be harder for companies to recruit talent
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.000]   for something like this after seeing what happened to CNN plus. The thinking at this point is that
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.680]   discovery wants to make HBO Max that discovery kind of agrees with you, Lisa, and thinks we're
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.280]   just going to make one master subscription that you get CNN, you get everything with HBO Max.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.840]   And I kind of agree with you. But how much would you pay? I mean, are they going to charge $50 a
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.720]   month for that or? I mean, I think it depends on what else you're subscribing to also. Like,
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.520]   if I'm only subscribing to one or two things, I will pay more for those services. But if I need
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.160]   to have like four or five services, I don't want to pay more than $5 a month for something else.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:42.560]   Yeah. What if you're already paying for it? What if we already have a subscription fee,
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.240]   a licensing fee like they do in the UK, except we call it Amazon Prime.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.760]   We bought Amazon because we wanted to be able to get our stuff faster. And Amazon Prime video
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.400]   just came along with it for free. No, I know it's expensive in the States. Here in Italy,
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:02.640]   it cost me 30 euro a year. That's nothing. And that's by free shipping. And that's all of the
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:08.880]   Amazon services, including Prime video. So that's that's my streaming service, not because I wanted
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.600]   that streaming service, but because it came with something else I already bought. And that's a great
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:19.440]   point because Amazon. Yeah, I don't know if I would I would have signed up for Amazon Prime video
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.320]   unless I already had Amazon Prime. But now that I have it, I do find myself watching it like fairly
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.560]   often again, not enough to get it on my own. But since it comes with Amazon Prime already,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.320]   yeah, that's a good point. I'm right with you there as well, Lisa. And we have similar in
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.440]   terms of the pricing strategy here. I mean, I get Prime for the same day shipping. And
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.640]   you know, when there's something that comes up on Prime, like the new, what's the thing that
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.080]   was Top Gear, the grand tour, new grand tour comes out, it's just on there. And that's great. And
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.560]   it's nice to have. But I'd never, I'd never sign up for that on its own. Absolutely not. I like
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.640]   the idea of a service where you get, it's like a service that sits on top of the streaming companies,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:04.400]   and you get like one hop a month. And you you can hop from Netflix one month to Disney plus the next
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.520]   month to Hulu plus the next month and to Apple TV the next month. I mean, it would never work
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.800]   because why would they agree to do something like that? And then there's all the technical problems,
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.200]   there isn't parity in the pricing models or anything. But in principle, I'd like that idea
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:23.280]   because I would probably give overall more money to each of those companies than if I was maintaining
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.880]   one subscription with them all for the whole year. I don't think we'll see it. But in terms of
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.600]   answering the question, what would we want? I would love something like that for sure.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:38.560]   I'll also have to say that Amazon Prime Video in Italy has way better catalog than Amazon
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:44.320]   Prime in the United States. I get all of Star Trek, so Picard and Discovery and all of the sci-fi
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.120]   series that I enjoy, everything from upload to the expanse. So it kind of depends where you
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.760]   locate it in the world, which only means it depends on what kind of VPN you have.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:01.200]   That general approach also kind of reminds me of Apple TV Plus as well. I mean, it's not exactly
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.560]   the same, but since Apple gives you, I think it's a full year that you get for free when you buy a
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.920]   new Apple device. That's a really long time. I guess the idea is you're already buying an iPhone or
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.600]   an iPad or whatever. And by the time the free trial is up, you probably forget that you
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.000]   not forget that you have it, but you're so used to watching it if you did fall into it that it's
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.080]   like, "Oh yeah, I'll pay five bucks a month to keep that." So it's a little different than Amazon,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.720]   but the same in that you're paying for something else and then you happen to get that service.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:35.600]   And also that Apple and Amazon don't have to make money on their streaming services.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:41.760]   So Netflix, that's it. That's all they've got. But Amazon, Apple, and I guess to some degree,
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:50.240]   Disney, it's just as incremental income for them. Or they even can sell it at a loss because they're
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:57.280]   going to make it up with sales in other areas. Apple TV is spending not as much money as Netflix,
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.840]   but they've gotten up to several billion dollars a year. And actually, I have to say, Apple TV
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.600]   is starting to look better and better. There's some shows on Apple TV now, which I would say
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.480]   are as good as anywhere else. And I couldn't say that for the first year or two.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.560]   Yeah. I mean, that was a war that I was.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:18.240]   Severns. Wow, that ending. I wasn't sure about the show because it's kind of sterile at first.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:26.160]   But by the time I was the of the last episode, I'm like, "You can't stop now. You must not."
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.080]   And Slow Horses, which they've just put out, which I was sure they bought from the BBC.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.720]   But in fact, no, they produced themselves is every bit as good as any BBC spot,
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:41.520]   spy drama. They got Gary Oldman to do TV. But that's an advantage because Apple can spend this
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:47.280]   money. That's not their business. Amazon can spend this money. Amazon, by the way, is spending
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.960]   more than anybody for this new Lord of the Rings. They spent a billion dollars just for the rights.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.280]   And I can't remember. And then now they're making, I can't remember what the per
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.760]   episode price is, but it's- It's coming like 250 million and half of that.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.080]   It's mind-boggling. Yeah. It's crazy. It's really crazy.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.000]   And you know- With the One Apple TV thing, by the way,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.320]   Invasion, I've got one more episode of that left to watch. And if I wasn't doing this,
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:18.800]   I'd be watching that. Interesting. It's the one service I uncancelled. I did cancel Apple TV.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.120]   I canceled Disney Plus. I canceled a couple of others. I went back to Apple TV and it was because
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.280]   of Invasion. There's one other thing Apple TV has not one little ace in its sleeve. It hasn't pulled
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:34.480]   out, which is sports. What's interesting is none of these competitors are doing live sports yet.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:40.000]   Amazon Prime has started to do it. And now Apple, they've got baseball and the rumor is strong that
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.280]   they're going to get Sunday night, Sunday ticket, which is a lot of football away from DirecTV.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:51.680]   That could really put them over the top. Sports is something people do pay for and are willing to
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:37:00.160]   pay for live sports. Netflix could do live F1. They have that show drive to survive.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.920]   That actually could be a cash cow for them if they could work that. Oh, man, I have to. I
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:15.120]   F1 in the US, it was just in Italy. I'm Ola at Emilio Ramagna, but it's 6 a.m. here.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.080]   I have to tape it. And don't tell me what happened because I haven't started the race,
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:26.320]   but I haven't watched it. But you're right. F1 has huge potential because of that Netflix show.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.840]   I would say they probably doubled their audience all of a sudden because of drive to survive.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.400]   And I'm going to just just really point out something just to correct myself on what I said,
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.760]   the 250 million about Amazon. That's what they paid for the rights to talk in, according to Hollywood
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.840]   Reporter. But it is a, they're saying $650 million budget for season one alone.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.360]   And that's how many episodes, if it's 10 episodes, 65 million, a show is astounding,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.800]   especially for an unproven property. I think that they spend, end up spending more than that on
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:02.960]   Game of Thrones. But that's a lot of money. And Amazon can afford it. And they don't even have
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.080]   to make it back with subscriptions. And that's the key. All right, let's take a little break.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.640]   It's fun to talk about TV, but we're going to have to talk about Elon Musk. I'm sorry.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.160]   I'm sorry, but we have to. And there'll be other stories to it's really wonderful to have Lisa
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.760]   at a Chico here. She is, of course, at CNET senior editor there. Wonderful to see you.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.120]   Thank you for joining us. Wonderful to be here. And for having me.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:35.760]   Also with this father, Robert Ballis there, the digital Jesuit from his home
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.920]   somewhere high above the Vatican, not that high, not all the way up, just halfway to heaven.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.680]   It's great to see you. And Nate Langson, who is tech editor at Bloomberg.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:52.880]   You're talking about VPNs, Robert, our sponsor for this segment, ExpressVPN.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:58.240]   There are three reasons you'd use a VPN. There's security, there's privacy,
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:04.640]   and there's the ability to watch Doctor Who. I would say all three are very, very important.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:10.880]   But one of the benefits of ExpressVPN is they are in more than 90 countries. So when you use
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.840]   ExpressVPN, it's really easy to put it on your phone, on your smart TV. You can even put it on
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:22.400]   your router, on your laptop, on your desktop. When you use ExpressVPN, you can say, I want to be
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:28.560]   in London right now. And then if you've got a Netflix subscription, you can binge all the doctor
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:35.040]   who you want on Netflix UK. That's just one of the many reasons to get a good VPN. But I have to tell
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:42.320]   you, I want to underscore good, because there are lots of awful VPNs, the free VPNs that spy on
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:48.880]   you and sell your marketing information, the VPNs that don't invest in infrastructure, not ExpressVPN.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.560]   They, they're not free, but that money goes to making them the best VPN out there, the only one
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.040]   I use, you can even put it on your router and protect your whole home. And it's so fast,
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.960]   nobody's going to complain. That's really, really important with a VPN. Not only do they invest in
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:10.000]   all those servers and all that bandwidth, they rotate their IP addresses. That's very important,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.080]   too, because the privacy angle on a VPN, when you're using ExpressVPN, you're not using your IP
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.800]   address when you make those Google searches or you visit those websites, you're using their IP
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.000]   address. And because they rotate IP addresses, they spend the money to get a whole bunch of them.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.480]   You are never the same person twice. That's real privacy. If you're not using a VPN,
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.880]   your internet service provider knows everything you do, Google knows, Google says, hello, welcome
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:44.240]   back. You don't, you know, the incognito mode is not incognito. You need ExpressVPN.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.880]   Use the internet without ExpressVPN is like checking your baggage at the airport without a lock.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:54.320]   Yeah, sure. Nobody's going to go through your bags unless they do and just think of all the
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:01.120]   things they'll find. That's not mine. When you go to online without a VPN, ISP see what you're doing,
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:09.200]   Google knows who you are with ExpressVPN incognito mode truly is private. Your identity is
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.680]   anonymized by a secure VPN server. And when you find out about the technical details of what
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:19.360]   ExpressVPN does to protect your privacy, I think you'll be very, very impressed. They just had an
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:26.320]   article and bleeping computer about this fascinating. They have a custom Debian distro running on
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:33.840]   their servers. It runs a server, a VPN server, they call their trusted server. It runs it in RAM.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:40.480]   And it can't sandbox. So it can't write to the disk. And then every day, the whole hard drive gets

[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.880]   there was already I'm thinking today, the day we don't have to mention Elon Musk on twit.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.560]   Is it going to be nope? Nope. There's already
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:55.520]   Elon chatter because early this morning, apparently he tweeted
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:05.200]   this two words and an ellipsis moving on. And all the pundits immediately jumped on that.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:11.040]   This is by the way, Elon loves this attention. This is I'm convinced the main reason he does this
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.520]   saying, Oh, he's moving on. He announced this week that he had enough money that he had the
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:21.680]   resources to buy Twitter that he had banking assurances from Morgan Stanley and others.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:27.760]   We thought, Oh, moving on from buying Twitter. No, no, three hours later, he says, moving on
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   from making fun of Bill Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:42.320]   Now, look, this is a mean tweet. But it's kind of apt. Yesterday,
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:49.920]   Elon tweeted this picture of Mr Gates in a blue polo shirt. Look, I'm no guy to say anything about
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:55.760]   a stomach. We got a little bit of a belly. And Elon said looks just like the pregnant guy emoji.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:04.320]   And he kind of does. Okay, it's kind of. Elon is like five. He's got the mentality of a 12 year old.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:11.120]   I don't personally think he should own Twitter. I think that's a terrible idea.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:18.080]   I think oligarchs should not own media. What do you think, Lisa? Is he going to buy Twitter or
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:26.480]   is all just fun and games? Honestly, I it's hard to say. I do think, you know, I agree. I do
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:34.240]   think, you know, it's probably best if Elon Musk does not own Twitter. But I think what's interesting
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.640]   is why he's interested in buying Twitter as well. And I know you've talked about Elon a bunch,
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.040]   so you've probably touched on this already. But he keeps kind of talking about how he sees a lot
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:49.120]   of potential in Twitter. And I think that kind of made a lot of people think about what Elon would
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.640]   do with Twitter if he actually bought it. And I think that's something that's on everyone's minds
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:02.400]   right now. He's talked about, he's been very vocal about his thoughts on free speech and content
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:09.600]   moderation and making the Twitter algorithm public. I think he, unless I'm mistaken, I think he has
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:15.280]   kind of talked about maybe making an open source or something like that, which would be a really
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:20.320]   big shift. But yeah, I don't know. It'll be interesting to see where things go.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   Yeah, I think actually Jack Dorsey is more interested in making Twitter open source,
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:31.200]   but he's not the CEO and he's not even on the board anymore. So we don't even care.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:39.920]   I'm going to call Elon a bullionaire. God, he's a billionaire, full of bull.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:48.240]   We'll give credit on that to actually, I first read it in the in bogus post on the
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:58.080]   Atlantic Elon Musk baloney king. But actually he gives credit to Benedict Evans, who's a great
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:05.520]   tech blogger, a bullionaire. So one of the things people thought Elon might be talking about,
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:10.640]   because he talks a lot about free speech is bringing back conservative voices like the former
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:16.880]   president. But then I read that House Republicans are just as nervous about Elon Musk.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.600]   As Democrats are, Jim Jordan sent a letter to Twitter saying,
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.880]   you must preserve all records about Musk's bid to buy the company,
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:37.600]   setting the grounds for a potential congressional probe of the acquisition. So even the right
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:44.240]   isn't happy about Elon's free speech. I think he's trolling us. What do you think?
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:51.440]   Father Robert, do you think he's trolling us? No, I think you think this series, Elon being
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:59.680]   authentic. No, not no. I think that Elon has a history of being pure id. He lets his id control
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:06.720]   as you know, he loves the pleasure principle. He's low key. He's low key. He likes chaos.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:12.480]   The monkey trickster. Yeah. And you have to remember, this is a person who grew up in
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:20.480]   a life of privilege. He grew up wealthy. He's used to having all of his needs met when he wants
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.880]   to met. He's used to having people take his meetings anytime he wants to take his meetings. So
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:31.200]   for him, this is all part of the same game. Now, the people who cheerlead Elon, I get that. I
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:36.320]   understand he's successful. He's wealthy. He seems well, we have things to thank you for.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:42.400]   Well, Tesla has promoted electric vehicles without Tesla. I don't know we'd be where we are today,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.080]   where we really need EVs. I don't know if we'd be this far advanced. SpaceX is a huge success, right?
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:54.800]   Which is great. And I want to reward him for that. People should be rewarded for coming up with
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:00.160]   brilliant ideas and for executing them. I'm absolutely not against that. What I am against is when
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:05.680]   people build up privilege and wealth by doing those things and then use that privilege and wealth
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.400]   to make it more difficult for everyone else to do the same. When you have a big player, a billionaire,
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.240]   a American oligarch. Pull the ladder up. Pull the ladder up. Pull the ladder up. Yeah.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:21.600]   And that's what this is. If you allow Elon to own Twitter, own any social media company,
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.160]   you are essentially recreating the disaster we have with Rupert Murdoch. And that never should
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:32.240]   have happened. I don't want part two. And unfortunately, that's what this would be. Elon in saying
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.880]   that he wants free speech is essentially saying, well, I want anything that the market will bear.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:42.080]   Everything that the market will bear does not work well for speech. That is not free speech.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:47.440]   In the United States and our Constitution, we have definite limits on free speech. You cannot
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.320]   yell fire in a crowded theater and call it free speech. That's essentially what Elon is saying,
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.800]   we should allow on Twitter. Should Jeff Bezos have been allowed to buy the Washington Post?
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:04.720]   Yes. It's very different there because jobs will be the Atlantic, which I just quoted.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:12.240]   Or in jobs. But look at how they're owning it. There is a block between ownership
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:17.840]   and editorial ship. Elon doesn't want to do that. If you look at the way Elon's companies work,
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.480]   the ownership is editorialist. He controls everything from top to bottom at any point,
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:28.800]   because he is it and super in at any point he can pop in and implement some crazy idea
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:35.440]   that cannot be how our media works, how our press works, how our expression of free speech works.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:44.480]   It does. That was the premise of Ian Bogost's column in the Atlantic. It is a bad thing for
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:50.400]   democracy. We need democracy. We need and I would say, and we need good journalism, as I just said,
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:50:00.880]   to bolster democracy so that the people in power are called to account. Thank you.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:11.200]   I fear that we're losing both in this country without a free press to speak truth to power,
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:17.040]   the oligarchs win. It's pretty clear that's what the oligarchs are trying to do,
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.880]   is buy up media. I'm hoping he's not serious, that he's just messing with us.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:30.480]   I sincerely hope he doesn't buy Twitter because I don't think any good will come of that.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:36.640]   Twitter is outside in its importance here in the United States. It doesn't have that many
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:41.760]   subscribers. It's one-fifteenth the size of Facebook. Unfortunately, it's the media that
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.080]   pay attention to Twitter and give it an outsized influence. Is it the same in the UK?
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.720]   By and large, it still is.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:58.320]   Lots of stories come out of Twitter. Elon, if nobody's paying attention to Elon, he tweets
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.920]   something and everybody's paying attention to Elon. The former president did the same thing.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:08.320]   As long as the audience is in any way global, then a newsroom has to pay attention to it,
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:16.880]   even if you're low-well. There is a small anarchist in me that thinks it would,
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:23.040]   for a very short period of time, be really quite entertaining to see Elon Musk own Twitter.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:30.480]   That would very quickly spiral, I think, into something that is not entertaining in the slightest.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   The other question, the more serious, suddenly, also thinks, what is it about Twitter specifically,
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.680]   that he would want to do with it? Because he has the means, certainly has the motive,
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:47.840]   has the resource, has the ability to set something up, to create something from scratch and attract
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:56.880]   a lot of people to it very, very quickly. Why, if he wants to run a successful business like that,
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:02.240]   why not build one? Why not start it? He could very easily do it. There's something specific to
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:07.680]   Twitter. That's why I think he's serious about wanting to buy it. That's why I think it's probably
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:13.600]   a good idea, as it has already been said on this show just now, why it's probably not a good idea.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:22.080]   Say I agree with you. It would be entertaining until it's so horrific that we would be going,
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:31.360]   "Stop!" I think it comes down to how influential Twitter can be in a weird way. I think Twitter
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.560]   tends to draw a lot of people I feel like tend to lump it into the same category as Facebook
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:41.600]   and other social media platforms. Like you were saying, Leo, it's not really the same because I
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:46.400]   feel like the people who really pay attention to Twitter the most are journalists, people in the
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:52.720]   tech industry. It's not really the social network where people go to post things about their personal
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:58.160]   life all the time, the way you might on Instagram. I think Elon sees that and he sees it as kind of
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:05.440]   a microphone. I honestly think that a big part of the reason why he's so interested in Twitter
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.800]   is because of that influence. As we just talked about the former president and Elon Musk himself,
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.560]   when they tweet something controversial, it's news. There's a whole news cycle that's built
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:20.240]   around it. You don't really get that from Facebook and some of these other social media platforms.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.840]   I think that is the main reason for the influence that Twitter can have.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:31.920]   Is Twitter biased against the right? Somebody in the chatroom says, "Twitter blocks everything
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:38.240]   today that doesn't fit the woke narrative." I hear that all the time and I would ask one question of
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:45.360]   everyone who has that opinion, define what the woke narrative is. You ask 50 people, but I know
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:51.200]   what I see it. You get 15 different answers. The woke narrative is, "Well, I don't like that,
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:58.880]   so it's woke." No, how about this? If you do not communicate in a civil way, people will block you.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.520]   I have a block bot that automatically does it for me. I have people that have created
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.840]   numerous accounts trying to get around it just so they can say, "It's not fair that you have a
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:13.040]   block bot." That's silly. If you can't communicate with me in a way that is going to encourage a
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.640]   civil conversation, why would I want to waste my time speaking with you?
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.240]   Elon says, "Twitter is biased against conservatives." If you actually look at it,
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:31.280]   there was just a study by professors at MIT and Yale called, "Is Twitter biased against conservatives?"
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.080]   The challenge of inferring political bias in a hyperpartisan ecosystem,
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:42.320]   the study basically concluded just what you just said, Father Robert. Twitter doesn't block people
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:48.400]   because of what they say. It blocks them because of how they say it, which is fair.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:56.880]   Right? If you're abusive, I don't care which side you're on, block them.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:04.400]   That's what my block bot does. I've looked at what it's blocking. It's just looking for sentiment.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:09.120]   It's looking for how things are being expressed. It's blocking about 50-50 people on the left and
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:13.920]   on the right. I don't want people yelling at me. There's nothing that comes productive out of
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.640]   you yelling at me. If you want to have a great conversation, we can go back and forth. If you
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.840]   want to explain why you feel the way that you feel, I actually want to know that. I become more
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.480]   intelligent. I become more informed about the world by hearing opposing viewpoints. I don't
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:32.800]   learn anything by someone saying, "Oh, that's just because you're a PEDO priest." That's because
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:40.720]   you're whoa. That's because... I don't need that. When people are saying, "Twitter is
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:46.000]   oppressing XYZ voice," what they really mean is, "I feel like people aren't listening to me scream
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.360]   into the ether." Guess what? No one should listen to you scream into the ether. You should learn how
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   to express yourself. Going back to our conversation, Nate, about the BBC, I would love to see a way
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:04.640]   in the United States that we could have a media that was not corporate bound, was not run by and
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:09.760]   owned by oligarchs, not run and owned by government either because that's not the solution. It's got
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:16.080]   to be able to speak truth to power, but somehow independent, fair, and free. Don't you have PBS?
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:20.880]   Isn't that what PBS is supposed to be? No. It's supposed to be. I guess to some degree,
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:28.160]   PBS is more balanced than anything else. Although if you watch, for instance, they have a nightly
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:34.000]   news hour, the PBS News Hour, the sponsors of which are all major US corporations.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.800]   So do they have influence? Well, there have been some studies that say PBS only brings on
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:46.240]   spokespeople from major US corporations or think tanks funded by major US corporations.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:53.920]   The influence of big business on the public discourse in the US is absolutely outsized.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:03.200]   It is. From what I hear, yes. I think that that is also the case here, but from a different standpoint.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:10.880]   I think that essentially it boils down a lot of time to money and privilege and where you were
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:17.120]   educated because if you look at a lot of the large media companies in Britain, some of them are owned
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:23.280]   by American giants, Channel 5, for instance, one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the UK,
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:30.720]   so I can't remember who owns it now, but it's definitely a US-owned Channel 4 has been
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:36.320]   in talks to be taken private because that was set up in part to be a free service that basically
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.600]   makes the content that no other broadcaster would make. It's one of the reasons it's quite
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:44.960]   unusual, never the most popular, but always- Paramount owns Channel 5.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:51.120]   So Paramount owns that in the UK as well. And then on the other side, you've got
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:58.720]   an establishment like the BBC that it always kind of tends to be run and influenced by
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:04.400]   people who have large political sway. They don't have advertising. Product placement is illegal.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:09.840]   It's things like that make the British landscape different, but it is equally
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:15.360]   influenced, I think, by a different type of power, but it's probably equal in size.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:23.360]   You know, Leo, we had this discussion in the United States not too long ago because we have PBS,
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:28.640]   and PBS is still the most unbiased news source in our country. I think that's fair. Yes.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:34.960]   I think that's fair to say. Yes. And remember, I remember there was one time where they had
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:41.840]   Arthur Daniel Midland at the main sponsor of the New South. And they were doing stories about what
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.320]   ADM was doing wrong and illegally. I'm like, OK, that's- I like that. I love to hear that.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:52.720]   But what was it? Two years ago, PBS ran a series about, I don't even remember what it was, but it
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:59.600]   was a darling of the MAGA community. And there was this huge campaign, defund PBS, take away tax
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:06.320]   dollars from this woke narrative. And the thing is, PBS had to remind them, we're supported by
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:13.360]   sponsors. We don't take your tax dollars. But even that became part of the anger machine of
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:18.560]   all the see the liberals have invaded PBS, which used to be a neutral news source. And it's like,
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:25.120]   well, I mean, PBS is out of crossroads now. They see where this is going. They're going to lose
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.960]   corporate support. They're going to lose public support. And they're going to cease to be a voice
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.760]   in the news, which they desperately need to be. So what's the other option? Take corporate money,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.960]   take more corporate money, take the corporate money that will actually have conditions on what
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:43.120]   they can report on the news. And there's no good solution for us right now.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:47.600]   Yeah. I just, I think it's a warning sign.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:56.240]   Democracies do not flourish if there isn't a free press. Moving on. Let's move on from media,
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.280]   because we've been talking about that a lot. Let's talk about Apple. Apple is telling developers,
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:06.480]   when I first saw this headline, I thought, Oh, good news, that they're going to pull apps
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.560]   that are out of date that are old from the app store. But now I'm starting to think maybe this
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.440]   isn't such a good plan. There are certainly a lot of apps in the Apple store that
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:24.320]   haven't been updated in years. Some of them don't work properly, but they're not all
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.080]   abandoned where and developers are starting to say, wait a minute, you mean I have to update my app,
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.520]   even though it doesn't need it just to keep it on the app store? This is especially true of games.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.000]   Here's a proto pop games tweet. I feel sick. Apple just sent me an email saying they're removing my
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.960]   free game, Moto Voto, because it's more than two years old. That's, that's not fair. It's,
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.040]   it doesn't need to be updated and people still download it.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:59.840]   I think this should be a simple solution to this, which is you, it's a check-in like,
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.120]   hey, you know, you're up still live, right? You're still happy with it. Any changes to make,
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:11.760]   you want, you know, maybe forced a, a, just to check that it still works, like an, an approval
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.960]   process, but on a diluted level. And that's it. Just need to be updated. You have, it's kind of like
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:22.800]   a new story. You have published on, updated on, and that's quite helpful. Do that with apps,
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.880]   published on most recent date, validated, checked for compatibility on such and such a date.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.840]   Why shouldn't that be a problem? I 100% agree with it. It's ridiculous. Should not be pulled.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.280]   Yeah. I'm 100% with this developer on this one.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:43.600]   I also feel like it's not like a one size fits all kind of an issue. And I think that's part of it,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.240]   too, is like, if there's a game that people love and it's still working properly and it's still
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.680]   functioning and people are still playing it, that's very different than, you know, I don't know,
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.240]   maybe an email app or something that isn't being maintained and isn't working or might have like
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.200]   a bug in it or something like that. So I, I do think that one size fits all approaches is
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.040]   going to be difficult to apply here. This is part of Apple's problem is that
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.160]   the success of the app store has been so huge and there are so many apps in there.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.960]   You want to, I can understand the desire to clean up the app store to prune out the weeds,
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.120]   but you can't, you just can't at scale. You know, you have to make arbitrary rules like,
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.520]   well, if it hasn't been updated in two years, it must be out of date.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.080]   Costa Ella Theri, who's been very critical of the app store, he wrote a program called
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:33.760]   Flick Type Keyboard, which was a keyboard for the watch designed for visually impaired users.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.760]   He says, Apple removed it because it hadn't been updated in two years. Meanwhile, games
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.640]   like pocket God have not been updated by the developers for seven years, but they're still on
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.800]   the app store. So, but I think those are the kinds of things that are going to happen at this scale.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.840]   It's very difficult. There's a problem. Sorry. Go ahead, Nathan.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.680]   There are much bigger problems on the app store than an app that works fine that you can still
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:07.120]   download and use not having been updated for two years. Copycat apps or apps that are just
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:16.560]   garbage, like there is so much bad app content on the app store and on the Google Play Store as well.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:23.360]   They do far better to just do a purge of apps that have not been downloaded and are just clogging
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:29.680]   up. There you go. Maybe use that. Maybe use that as the criterion. Nobody's downloaded this in three
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.000]   years. Maybe it's time to remove it. Yeah. That would be, for me, at least that would make more
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.480]   sense. Get rid of that. Get rid of the clones that you can really, really game.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.760]   Oh, man. There's so many wordle clones. I thought they got rid of them,
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.000]   and then more sprang up and they're not free.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.640]   Look at the titles and the names that you can game this like '90s SEO, putting different words in
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:58.240]   the meta tags. It's really, really bad. It's really bad.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:04.720]   There's also the larger question of some games are art, even if they haven't been updated in years.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.000]   If they're still playable, it's a work of art. You don't ask Picasso to update what you
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.560]   couldn't, but you wouldn't ask Picasso to update a painting just because he finished it.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.480]   Lisa, we interrupted you. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.240]   Oh, yeah. No, I was just going to say it's one thing if an app is in danger of possibly not
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.360]   working anymore because it hasn't been updated in seven years. Maybe if it hasn't been updated
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.880]   that long, there's a chance it won't. This is just a hypothetical scenario, but I can see Apple doing
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.480]   that if there's a chance it wouldn't be supported by the next version of iOS or something like that.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.440]   I think Apple has part of why it's so strict in its policies is because it doesn't want you to
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.000]   have to sift through all of these apps that don't work or don't function properly. When you go to the
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.400]   app store, there's a certain level of trust in whatever you download is going to run smoothly.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:00.320]   It's designed and optimized for these devices. I get that Apple really wants to crack down on
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:06.640]   making sure developers keep up and keep their apps updated. Going back to what Nate was saying,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:13.360]   there's bigger problems. Obviously, copycat apps and clone apps are a much bigger issue,
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.840]   but I think it all falls under that same umbrella of there is a certain level of trust.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:25.760]   But at what cost does that come to the developer community too? Developers have not been that
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.520]   happy with Apple over the past couple of years. I think that's also part of
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:37.680]   this is just adding fuel to the fire in that regard. That's all I was going to add.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:45.360]   It's taken me to the other way. Okay. Go ahead, Robert. I want both Apple and Android,
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.480]   not just to remove apps that are not updated on their stores. I want them to remove them from
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.560]   my phone because I've got apps on my phone that have been transferred from phone to phone.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.080]   You want us to do your job. I'm not. I don't. Yes.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.000]   Spring clean the whole day. Nuke it from orbit is what I'm saying.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.480]   But I just download a slay the spire. All right.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:14.880]   You know, I don't want I wouldn't want any company to go that far, but I do agree that it would be
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:21.760]   nice if there were more tools built into these operating systems that helped you realize what's
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.520]   on your phone and how old some of those apps might be. Because even as a tech journalist,
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:31.280]   I have so many apps on my phone that I don't use or maybe I downloaded them once for a specific
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.200]   story that I was working on. And then I forgot about them. So it's a lot. It's a burden on people
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.920]   to do that themselves. So I would love to see more of that in iOS and Android updates.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.840]   I also have turned on the thing. This is if anybody in my family downs on zen app,
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:51.760]   which means there's an interesting surprising number. Well, let's put it this way. Lisa,
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.120]   a couple of days ago said, I didn't just buy Tinder. I said,
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.000]   I didn't think you just bought Tinder. She said, well, it says I just bought Tinder.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:10.880]   I said, I hope you didn't buy Tinder. It turns out our 19 year old son bought Tinder.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.760]   And it showed up on all our phones, though. So it just, you know, that got.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.560]   Wait, do you have to buy Tinder? I thought Tinder was a free app.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   Well, for some reason, he's paying 10 bucks a month. Maybe it's super Tinder.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:30.400]   Tinder pro Tinder plus I don't know. I wouldn't know either. You and I, neither of us know.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.600]   We're talking about.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.200]   Gee, Lisa, do you have anything to say about Tinder plus?
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:43.600]   I was going to say I'm with Robert on this one. I thought it was free. So hopefully it's not a
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:49.360]   scam app or something like that. Oh God. I didn't even think of that. Yeah. Oh, man.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:56.160]   I have found three of Apple's own apps that would it would have to remove under its own policy
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.400]   just in the time we've been talking about that. Apple's apps. That's right.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.560]   Remember the remote? Apple remote wasn't updated for five years.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:09.520]   Because that guy was busy. There's one here called indoor survey published by Apple that
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:14.160]   marks two years old. So that would have to go. There's a Texas Hold 'em game. Apple released
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.040]   apparently to great fanfare according to some of the reviews. I don't remember that.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:21.440]   Wow. Well, apparently, more than that. There's anyone else because it hasn't been updated for
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:31.360]   two years. So there you go. There you go. Oh, oh, the chat room saying, oh, he bought Tinder Silver.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:40.560]   Is that like a Cougar Finder? Yeah, a Cougar Finder. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Let's take a little
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:48.960]   break. And we will have more. Great panel. Nice to see you. Nate Langson from the UK Tech Editor
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:54.400]   at Bloomberg. You know, where this is a very international show. I like this. You're in. Tell
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:59.680]   me again what part of England you're in. I'm in a lovely little town called Brock's port,
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:05.120]   which is slightly north of London. Nice. And it's mostly trees and birds and animals. Oh, it sounds
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:12.560]   wonderful. Sounds lovely. Can you take the train into town? I can if I want to. Or I can go and walk
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.720]   down the canal for part of it. Oh, how nice. Get yourself a little boat. Row down the Thames.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.960]   There's people who live on the house boats around here as well. Yeah, great. Great.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:29.280]   Clear and all sorts. Yeah. Also with this father, Robert Ballisair, he's in Rome,
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:35.680]   actually a little tiny place called Vatican City. Up above the, you're in the top floor of the
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.480]   Jesuit house. Is that where you are? This is actually not just the roof of the Jesuit house.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:44.960]   If you were to go to Google Earth right now and look at our house, you could see my office,
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.720]   because it's like a little tower on the roof. Oh, no, I'm going to ask you. And behind me,
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.240]   this is actually a window. If I were to open up the window, you could see St. Peter's behind me.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:01.520]   What's your three words for the location? Oh, my gosh, that's right. I should figure that out.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.600]   You should know. So I can quickly go there. How would I, if I had the long longitude and
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.400]   latitude, I guess I could go there. I think Google Earth actually gives you the longitude.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.800]   St. Peter's. I can't. Not St. Petersburg, Florida. St. Peter's Vatican City.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.320]   St. Peter's. You're looking for Casa General, Lisa della Compagnia de Jesú.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.840]   Well, yeah, it's easy for you to say. Is that Latin?
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:33.360]   Whoa, here we are. Here we are. Okay. So now you're down here, right?
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.520]   We're on the left side. Okay. You see where you see all those tennis courts right there?
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.520]   Yeah. In those those soccer fields? Yeah.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.080]   Okay. That building that the blue pin is on, move your mouse over to the right, right there.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.000]   That's us. That's us. Zoom in on that.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.920]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Now move down a little bit.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.840]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right there. That's that square. I'm inside that.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.520]   The big one or the little one? No, the big one. That's my office.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.200]   Wait, let's look in the window. See if we can see him. Oh, I can't get any closer.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.480]   Look at that. That's where you're. That's where you are right now.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.960]   That's where I am. So jealous. Is there a good gelata Ria down this down the road or anything?
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.520]   There are two. One is called Old Bridge and the other one is called Cramella. Wow. Look at this.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:23.200]   I can't believe it. Look where you are. You can come visit any time you want. And that's
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.360]   our garden that to the left. That's pretty. You can wander around and not a cat's live.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:33.280]   That's where the cats are. Okay. That's who's the statue of? That's all of all. I mean, Jesus.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.920]   I've heard him. Okay.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:44.320]   I'm surprised there's only one. Okay. Let's take a little break. Also,
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.640]   lovely to have Lisa at a Chico here. In fact, I'm going to put you to work in a second, Lisa,
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:58.080]   because there are rumors. There are rumors floating around. And I mean around. But first,
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:05.040]   a word from Audible. We love Audible. Audible has been a sponsor for our shows for, I think,
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:12.880]   more than a decade. Just the best place to get audio entertainment, whether it's audio books,
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:20.880]   performances, bestsellers to celebrity memoirs, mysteries, thrillers, motivation. The Audible
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.920]   app makes it easy to listen anytime, anywhere you'll discover exclusive Audible originals
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.840]   from top celebrities, renowned experts, exciting new voices in the audio. You can listen to Audible
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.200]   while traveling, working out. I kind of miss it. I used to have, I've been an Audible member since
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:44.480]   2000, 22 years now. I used to listen when I commuted into San Francisco to tech TV. And I kind of
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:48.960]   miss it. Because I would get a couple of hours at least sometimes as much as three or four hours a
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:57.040]   day in the car listening to great audio literature, audio books. I'm gonna make a recommendation,
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.280]   because I'm listening to, maybe you know this when Father Robert, you know the Bobaverse?
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:10.720]   I love the Bobaverse. I love the Bobaverse. The Bobaverse, the premise of the Bobaverse is
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:19.040]   fascinating. It's an oyman probe. The idea is this guy, Bob, Bob Johansson, very successful game
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:25.840]   developer, right, you know, signs a contract to have his head frozen. You know, just in case,
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.880]   because he just sold his company's got extra money. He's in Vegas for a trade show signs the contract.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.760]   And I don't think it's a spoiler because it happens in the first five pages gets killed,
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.160]   immediately run over by a car. His head is frozen. The next thing he knows, he wakes up 100 years
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:50.480]   later, and he's got no body. He's an artificial intelligence made out of his brain. And he goes,
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.320]   and the story is fantastic. He replicates himself. They go out and explore the universe. They meet
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.320]   alien civilizations. They meet hostile aliens. There's space warfare that there's also a lot
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.520]   of humor in it. And you got to listen to it because Ray Porter reads it. He's the guy who did the
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:14.880]   Martian. You'll recognize his voice. Mr. Johansson, it's Bob, please. You're not talking to my father.
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:22.480]   I love his delivery. That's what's so cool about audiobooks from audible. They you're not reading
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:29.280]   them. You're listening to them. Their performances. And they are so great. Audible includes thousands
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:34.640]   of podcasts for popular favorites and exclusive new series. That by the way, the Bobiverse is an
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:41.680]   audible exclusive. It wasn't slated for an audiobook. So audible brought them in and record got Ray
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.960]   to do it and recorded it all four volumes, a fifth volumes on the way. Audible gives members a chance
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:51.200]   to listen to and discover new favorites and explore different formats. Part of what makes your
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.840]   membership so much more valuable, things like the exclusive words plus music series or maybe a
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:01.440]   podcast you never thought of or consider before even theatrical performances. Now, as an audible
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.000]   member, you could choose a title a month to keep from there and to keep, I should say, I should
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.680]   emphasize to keep, I have been a member for 22 years. I have more than I think I'm up to 600 in my
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:16.320]   library. And I go back when Dune came out, I thought, I'm gonna relisten a Dune. I'll go back
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:23.280]   and listen to him again. They're yours as long as you're a member to keep in your catalog the best
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.840]   sellers, the new releases. You can download them. You can stream them. You can listen anywhere on
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.600]   any time on any device. I even listen on my Amazon Echo. I just say Echo read to me and it'll pick
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.880]   up where I left off, which is awesome. I'm listening in the car. I get home. I say read to me. It'll
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:44.240]   pick up right where I left off. 2022 is all about celebrating our newfound self awareness,
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.600]   making positive change. Audible helps make space for what matters to you. It's a destination,
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.840]   not just for entertainment, but for wellness, whether you're looking to soul search, be inspired,
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.720]   work toward new goals, unwind or simply be entertained. Audible can make you happy. It'll
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:07.120]   certainly make you smile or cry or sigh. It's got it all. You'll find the best of what you love or
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.160]   something new to discover. If you want to try it, new members can try Audible for 30 days free,
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:19.760]   which by the way, with the new Audible originals means lots of listening, hundreds and hundreds of

[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.920]   big Neil Stevenson fan and I'm really excited about that. Father Robert, you still listen to
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:04.320]   audiobooks? I have to ask you this, Leo. Do you re-listen to audiobooks?
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:10.160]   Sometimes, like I said, I like Dune. I re-listen to. I've got three authors.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.440]   I've always listened to. Dan Realy Taylor, Andy Weir, and Daniel Suarez.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:22.640]   Roger Hail Mary is incredible. Highly recommend that. Of course, Daniel is a friend of the,
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.960]   both all three of them. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:30.480]   Dancy Taylor yet. I hope to make a friend of him, but both Andy Weir and Daniel Suarez have been on
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:38.080]   the show. And Ray Porter reads "Project Hail Mary" in that same kind of great style. Wonderful,
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:43.920]   wonderful. Or you get in Spanish and then Raul Lawrence will read it for you. So either way,
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:52.880]   Pojekto Hail Mary. All right, here it comes, the round pixel watch. Now,
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:18:00.000]   Lisa, tell me, Google filing a trademark application for the words pixel watch. Does that confirm
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.880]   this watch? Or is it, I mean, maybe they don't want anybody else to call it a pixel watch.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:12.000]   Yeah, I mean, I think you're right. It doesn't confirm anything yet. They could just be doing
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.080]   it because they don't want anyone else using that branding, although I don't think anyone would,
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.440]   because it would probably make things really confusing. But I don't think it confirms anything,
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.480]   but we've been hearing so many reports that Google, for years, not even just recently,
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.440]   but for years, we've been hearing that Google has been working on its own smartwatch. And by we,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:36.800]   I'm talking about the collective news cycle and the rumors and reports that have been floating
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   around for years, not anything that I'm specifically aware of or anything like that. But we have been
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:49.520]   hearing more reports recently, and one of which I think one of the most detailed ones came from
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:54.880]   Insider, I believe it might have been December, I'd have to double check. But that report had a lot
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:01.520]   of details actually written by one of my former colleagues, since I used to work there. You
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.480]   Langley, my former colleague at Insider, wrote this great report about how Google was working on a
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:12.640]   pixel watch and it'll probably have, I think that report mentioned things like the design
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:18.240]   possibly being round, which wouldn't be very surprising because I think all android wear watches
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.000]   are round, I'd have to double check that, but I'm pretty sure they all have that round design.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.360]   I think you're right. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't seen a square one, but again, I could be missing
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.400]   a number of things. Fossil might make one, but I, you know, I think they're round, yeah.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.360]   Yeah. And you know, that report mentioned a bunch of things that we would expect,
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.800]   like health tracking features and things like that. But you know, I wouldn't be, there's also a
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:46.800]   bunch of things that you can kind of assume would be on a Google smartwatch. If Google did make a
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.040]   smartwatch, like integration with Fitbit seems pretty logical, you know, the latest version of
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:59.360]   WearOS. But I think to me, what would stand out the most is, you know, Google has done a really
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:04.560]   great thing with its pixel phones and that it kind of has a lot of software features that
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:11.120]   make it stand out. And, you know, that's a hard thing to do in, you know, a space like the smart
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.440]   phone market that's already pretty crowded and pretty dominated by Apple and Samsung.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.880]   But I really like the way Google thinks about, you know, taking care of some of those
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.320]   inconveniences that we experience on our phones sometimes, like, you know,
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:30.240]   having the Google Assistant screen calls for you and things like that or estimating wait times
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:34.240]   how long you'll be on hold, things like that. So I'm personally hoping that we see
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:39.040]   some version of that in a Google smartwatch. I don't know what it would be, but like really
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:45.360]   thinking about how to improve the way we use these devices. And I think that's one thing that
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.480]   we've seen from Google that is pretty unique. So I hope that carries over to the pixel watch.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.000]   If it is, in fact, real, of course.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.040]   One of the things you told me in your article, and I was, I've forgotten this.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.320]   Google's never made a watch.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:04.160]   Yeah, they don't have their own consumer watch yet. And that's the thing. It's kind of similar to
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.560]   what the smart phone market was like for Google before it came out with its pixel phones. I mean,
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:13.440]   it had its Nexus phones for a while, but those weren't really as popular, but Google was still
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:19.920]   so influential, obviously, because it's the operator of Android. So it has this really huge,
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:26.240]   you know, presence in the mobile space, but it's also a competitor. You know, it's weird in that it
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:31.680]   has to partner with the companies that it competes with. And that would be the case for smart watches
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.560]   too. And I think that would be a challenge for Google, you know, having, if it does release a pixel
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:43.040]   watch, it will have to, you know, obviously promote that while also working with Samsung,
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.840]   which would then be one of its competitors, and then also differentiate its own watch from FitBits
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:53.440]   watches. So it's, it would, you know, there's a lot going on there. So it could cause some confusion.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.920]   It kind of makes sense because Google bought FitBits that they, you know,
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:05.440]   they still release FitBits, but they're not under the Google brand that they might want to brand a
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:11.120]   watch, a pixel watch. Do you think that this is the pixel watch, the one that was left behind in a
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:19.440]   restaurant? You know, I actually haven't seen that. I don't know. It looks like the renders.
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:25.040]   It does look like the renders, but who knows if that's even legitimate, who knows how old it is,
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.600]   or if that was even meant to be something that would even be a final version of it,
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.880]   there's a lot of questions we won't really know until Google comes out and says it.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:38.480]   Yeah. Whoever left at the restaurant apparently took the band with them.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.160]   Yeah. There isn't a band.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.640]   Oh, maybe it's a pocket watch. I would get that.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.120]   That would be pretty cool.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.120]   I would buy a Google pocket watch.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.480]   Put a chain on that thing and have a monocle at the end. I'm in.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.000]   A Google.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.480]   That's not real.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:00.800]   Here's the thing though. Google's pixel strategy from the phone to the, to the,
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:06.080]   the pixel book has always been to inspire their partners to make something better.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:10.320]   That's what the first one was the Moto 360, right? And that was a great watch.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.840]   It was round. I really exactly.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.520]   Yeah. Actually, I, I, you had it. You bought it.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.520]   Yes. And then you gave it away. And I got it. I wore it for six months.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.960]   Is that where that was? Oh, it wasn't really waterproof.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.400]   Oh, no. Yeah. It's kind of a bummer.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.760]   No, I really loved it.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.840]   The problem is if you are an Apple user, you're going to end up using an Apple watch.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.040]   Correct.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.520]   And if you're an Android user, you're probably a Samsung user.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.840]   So you're going to use a Samsung watch.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:45.680]   I think that's the thing here too, is that there is, you know,
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.360]   the Android space is more fragmented. You know, there is no,
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:55.760]   just like you kind of mentioned right now, there is no, just one answer to the Apple watch on the
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:59.920]   Android side of things. There's choice, right? There's Samsung, there's Fitbit, which works across
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:05.440]   both. There's fossil. So I think Google has an opportunity. Like, we were just
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.520]   talking about to say, hey, this is the ideal Android smartwatch experience.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:15.760]   You know, just like the Pixel has kind of become a blueprint for what Android smartphones could be,
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:22.160]   a Pixel watch might do that for Android smartwatches. So I'm very interested to see what Google does
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.160]   with this, especially since it's pretty late to the game at this point compared to the rest of the
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:33.040]   industry. Question to you, which is so with the other Pixel products, Google has always tried to
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:38.000]   fill in something that they feel is missing. Like the products don't get right. So with the phones,
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.840]   it was, look, you need to have better screens and faster processors. With the Chromebooks,
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.800]   it was, you need a premium Chromebook, no more of this $50 to $200 stuff. And they proved that
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:55.040]   that could work. So what does Google think is missing in the Android watch arena? What are the
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.120]   features that it wants to include and inspire the other manufacturers to put in?
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:05.280]   Yeah, I think that's what we're hoping to see. I mean, it's hard. I can't answer that question
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:12.160]   for Google. But what I'm hoping to see is, I guess, I think a lot of it's going to come down to the
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.440]   software, honestly. But again, that's a tricky question because how much of it is going to be
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.720]   specific to the Pixel watch if there is a Pixel watch and how much of that is just going to be
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.080]   part of whatever the next version of where OS is that, you know, would come to Samsung smartwatches
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:33.280]   and Fossil smartwatches and presumably, you know, other companies that partner with Google.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.880]   So I think that's going to continue to be the challenge is again, like having Google say, like,
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.200]   hey, this is what we feel like needs to be done better. And we're doing that on our product
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:48.320]   versus how much does it, you know, also share with the rest of the industry. So I'm curious to see
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:55.600]   how they strike that balance. It's a tough job because Apple is so dominant. And then if they're
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:02.240]   not, like I said, Samsung is what could you do that Apple and Samsung don't do? Well, good battery
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.840]   life might be something. Yeah, absolutely. More than one day battery life.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   But Fitbit already does that really well, too, at least compared to Apple and Samsung. So I
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:21.680]   I hope that Google, you know, get some inspiration from Fitbit, which they now own. But yeah, I mean,
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.560]   battery life is definitely a big part of that for sure.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.160]   There's so much parody. I have both the Samsung Galaxy watch for
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.240]   and an Apple watch series six. And there's so much parody between them for
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:39.760]   activity, heart rate, sleep monitoring. I mean, it's hard to imagine what you what you're missing,
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.280]   except the things that Apple has historically not been able to do. No one's been able to do
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:48.720]   things like blood sugar monitoring and blood pressure, which is both of which are very hard to do.
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.600]   Some watches claim blood pressure. I wonder.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.800]   I think a lot of it. Yeah, I think a lot of it's going to come down to how
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.520]   they decide to show that information. And I mean, Google, you know, you were asking,
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.680]   what can they possibly do differently? What can they bring to this that Apple and Samsung haven't
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.320]   already done yet? You know, one thing that I would personally like to see is, you know,
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.160]   we have so many health metrics now that can be measured on our wrist. And you just mentioned
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.960]   some of the ones that we can't measure yet, which is probably a good thing because, you know,
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.640]   I think having I have a lot of opinions on having access to that kind of data from home. And on one
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.280]   side, it's great that you can learn more about your health. On the other side, without the context
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:34.000]   of a doctor, I kind of worry about having all that information at our fingertips. But I honestly
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.880]   think that companies can be doing a lot more to make this data useful to us.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:43.920]   Samsung's not Samsung promised the Google Assistant on their watch. They still haven't done it.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.120]   Maybe that's something I mean, I guess.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:54.080]   I hope so. I mean, I think there's a big opportunity for, you know, Google to really prove how useful
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:00.160]   the assistant can be on smart watches because, theoretically, you know, it's, you know, that is
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.240]   the, you know, the Google Assistant is in so many different products. I don't find myself using it
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:09.760]   that often on phones. But I use Siri on my Apple watch all the time because it's such a small screen.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.960]   I don't really want to type on it. I don't want to really navigate the watch that much using
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:21.280]   swipes, like for short things and short interactions, absolutely. But if I want to quickly set a timer
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.520]   or check the weather or something like that, I use Siri all the time for things like that.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.480]   So I think Google has a big opportunity to really show what the assistant can do on a pixel watch.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:39.600]   Interesting. Yeah, you're right. That's that we don't have the assistant on any of these
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.800]   watches yet, do we? Does Mone do it? Does Fossil do it?
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:50.480]   It is on some smart watches, I believe. But I do think that it was promised to come to the Samsung
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:54.640]   Galaxy Watch 4. And I don't think it's come out yet. I'd have to double check, but I don't think
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.760]   it has. In fact, I think Samsung's, if they're not putting it off forever, they're delaying it
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:05.760]   significantly. Yeah. All right. I mean, it shows you that Google still has some mind share that
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.720]   people are even talking about this. Somebody in the chat room says, "Any Google Watch should have
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.120]   the feature that Google releases it then kills it a month later." They'd be competing with the
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:24.400]   Kin and Qibby and CNN+ for the quickest death. Quibi, that's what I was trying to think of earlier.
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.680]   Quibi, yeah. Yeah.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:32.080]   Comparison I could have pulled out, then the Kin. No, I liked the Kin. No, no, I liked it.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:38.400]   I loved it. Palm Zion. The Palm Zion. I don't even know that one.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.800]   It was the product that was manufactured, marketed, and then destroyed before it was ever released.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.360]   Oh. That is definitely the shortest product ever.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:51.280]   Million. No, wait a minute. Microsoft says, "Hold my beer." Didn't they do a surface
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:57.200]   tablet, lightweight surface tablet? Oh, the two-screen. Yeah. No, the courier they never did. But they
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:03.200]   also did a no-or-the-do-oh. There's a lot of bad products out there. Come to think of it.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.440]   But remember, was the first thing such an Intella did when he took over his CEO and said,
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.040]   "We're not releasing that." And there was a warehouse full of them.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:15.040]   That's right. That's right. There was a -- not the mini.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:22.160]   I can't remember what it was called, but it was kind of -- Oh. What about the three-come Audrey?
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:28.880]   Oh, the Audrey, which is the kitchen computer. That's right. For all you gals who like to work
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:37.440]   in the kitchen, you'll love the Audrey kitchen computer. Yeah, that was a long time ago.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.880]   That was ancient history. Yeah, we're digging back now.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:48.400]   Would they announce it? So Google I/O's coming up. It's a weird, non -- it's not exactly hybrid,
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.840]   slightly hybrid event, mostly online. But there'll be a few people at the event,
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.920]   mostly developers and Google employees. Would that be where they would announce it?
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:03.040]   Prosser, who said they would announce it in May, is now backtracking and saying,
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.920]   "He's one of the big Google Pixel rumors." Rumor, guys, he actually does Apple rumors too.
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:12.560]   He's now saying they'll show it or talk about it at Google I/O, but won't release it until
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:18.320]   October. That seems like a stupid plan. No, I'm pretty sure that Google is just going to
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:23.840]   release another messaging app. Yeah. That's the killer. There it is, the killer app for the
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:30.560]   Pixel Watch messaging. Brilliant. Because you've always trusted Google with your messages.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:37.120]   All right, maybe not. Let's see. Speaking of Google,
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:47.280]   Vice had a great article on Google's AI-powered inclusive warnings feature. This is part of kind
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:53.040]   of a grammar checker that's rolling out this month for Google Docs. And of course,
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:59.920]   Vice having some fun with it. For instance, one of their motherboard senior staff writers typed
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:07.280]   "annoyed." Google suggested "angry or upset," which is not a good replacement for "annoyed."
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:13.040]   Then, "Social editor Emily Lipstein typed in "motherboard," as in the name of this website,"
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:20.800]   into a document. Google said, "You're being insensitive. Using the word motherboard."
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:26.400]   Some of these words may not be inclusive to all readers. Consider using different words.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:31.360]   Then another person, a journalist Rebecca Baird Remba,
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:38.480]   tweeted that she got the warning on the word "landlord," which Google said, "You should say
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:45.680]   "property owner or proprietor." Maybe this isn't going to be. Well, they're working on it.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:53.120]   Let's say they're working on it. I am not so much interested in the whole inclusive language
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:58.320]   grammar check. As I am in the technology that they're using to do this, my understanding is this
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:05.520]   isn't just a find and trigger type of thing. Is it GPT? This is actual context analysis.
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.880]   And if it is that, that would be a great hook because right now I'm paying Amazon for context
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.360]   analysis. That's expensive. If Google could give me a product, I would definitely try it.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:22.480]   That is interesting. I've used that on not this and not for quite some time now,
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:32.240]   but a script that picked out language in job specs and in adverts for jobs to try and make
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:39.680]   sure that you weren't using language and keywords and phrasing that could put off a more diverse
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:44.320]   pool of candidates for a position. There was a really interesting study done,
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:49.200]   which I don't have to hand because it's only just come back to my mind. I'm sure it can be
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:55.120]   Googled. A study done about inclusive language within the world of job applications. And actually,
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:03.360]   you get a much rich or can get a much richer workforce by tuning the language used in your job
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:10.080]   specs. And I've used that before. How effective that is long term is hard to measure, at least
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:16.240]   from my perspective. But I do think that there's a kernel of validity in some of these things that
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:21.280]   can be helpful, perhaps not quite to this level, but sometimes.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.680]   Yeah, well, we have a sponsor Grammarly and I use Grammarly. My wife needs Grammarly because
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:33.600]   she can sometimes she's the boss. She runs the place. And as she's got a lot of stuff to do,
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:37.920]   sometimes she'll remind me, "Well, seem curt because she's just giving you the information."
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:43.280]   And Grammarly will say, "Maybe just you know, please thank you." And I think that that's appropriate.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:46.880]   And she appreciates it when they when they reminds her, you know, "You got to be nice."
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:54.240]   Sometimes you got to be nice. Craziness going on in the world of travel after a judge in Florida
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:35:02.720]   lifted the CDC's requirement for masks on airplanes and on buses and on trains. Uber went along and
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.320]   lifted the mask mandate for drivers and riders. I'm curious since we've got people all over the
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.360]   world here, you know, here in California, I just went yesterday. We had our big,
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:20.000]   for the first time since the pandemic, our big parade and celebration. It's called Butter and
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.960]   Eggs Day and it's a heart attack in the making. But it's a lot of fun. And I went downtown and
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:34.160]   we watched the parade in the cutest little chicken town contest. No masks, no social distancing.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:41.520]   People were so happy to get outside and party and have fun and it was as if it was like two years
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:47.280]   ago. And I'm just curious, Nate, what's it like in the UK right now? Here in the United States,
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:53.120]   there seems to be a growing, regardless of what's happening with COVID, a growing desire to say,
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:36:00.960]   "chuck it all" and go back to the way it used to be. We haven't had masks enforced for quite some
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:08.720]   time now. So Uber dropped it when the law said it was no longer mandated. I can't remember exactly
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:15.040]   when that was, but it was a little while ago. And the numbers have been very, very high,
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.880]   but the number of hospitalizations were relatively low. So they just stuck to it now and now infection
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:27.040]   rates are falling again. But it's been a long time since I've felt pressure to wear a mask. I've
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:34.000]   done it out of courtesy on occasion, but it's very much not expected here right now.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.360]   Apple has ended the mask mandate in retail stores in the US. Amazon made masks optional
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.400]   last month for warehouse workers. Big tech companies are starting to bring their workers back,
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:49.040]   by the way, kicking and screaming because the workers don't want to come back. What's it like
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:57.360]   in Italy right now? Everyone's right. Really? Well, not everyone. I mean, outside, it's still
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:01.360]   pretty much everyone takes it down and puts it over their nose. But in the Vatican, you're still
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:08.240]   required to wear a mask. And in the areas, the main areas of Rome, people understand what happens
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.960]   if the rates start going back up. Right. And so out of Italy got hit so hard.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.600]   So hard. Early on. Right. We were the first in the Western world to get hit. And we got hit so
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:24.160]   hard. And people learned from that. And also, I mean, everyone in my house, we wear masks.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.040]   None of us had a flu or a cold for two years. That's the other reason to keep it on. Yeah.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:32.640]   Yeah. I don't want to get cold. That's a good reason.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:37.600]   I didn't ask you, Lisa, are you on the east coast of the West Coast?
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.600]   Yeah. I'm on the east coast in New York. Where there have been
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:50.560]   spiking happening. Yeah. And you see, for the most part, I feel like it's kind of mixed. I do
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:56.320]   see people with masks, but especially outside, I also see people not wearing them. The one place
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.120]   you definitely continue to see them a lot is the subway, of course.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.880]   Every pretty much everyone on the subway is wearing a mask. There'll be a couple of people
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.600]   that might not have one, but I feel like that's usually the exception for the most part. Good.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:15.280]   But I mean, indoors restaurants, things like that. People used to at least kind of walk in with
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.680]   their mask on and then take it down. But now I think people are for the most part, just
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:25.200]   not really wearing them as much indoors in restaurants, at least from what I've observed.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.400]   I think I wanted there to be like a day where everybody said it's over.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:34.960]   That's not going to be that way. In fact, if there are places I will continue to wear a mask.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:42.640]   I've got a pretty good supply of them now. It should be okay to do either, I think.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:48.000]   One of the things that's happened over the last couple of days that's got a lot of people very
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:58.000]   annoyed here is the emphasis on a certain lawmaker in our conservative government here, who so badly
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:06.800]   wants every civil servant to be back in the office, that he printed out a very, very passive
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:13.360]   aggressive letter and left it on their desk saying, "Sorry, I missed you. I have to see you back
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:21.280]   at your desk." The gentleman who does this, his name is Jacob Reesmog. I will bite my tongue in the
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:28.880]   interest of not making a fool out of myself, but just Google it, have a look at it.
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:34.480]   He is the sort of person you would expect to do, something like this. The fact that he's done
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:40.800]   something like this has made a lot of people just face palm so hard, but it goes back, and
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.800]   the tech angle here is about working from home, and about how effective can people be when your
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.240]   office job is a desk job, how effective can you still be having two years of experience doing
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:58.080]   those jobs remotely? The answer is for, I think, many people, very effective. These kind of passive
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.040]   aggressive ways of trying to get people back into the office when they're very happy and very
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:08.480]   potentially efficient doing their jobs from home one or two days a week, it's very offensive,
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:14.000]   and a lot of people in the public over the weekend have been really quite angry about this.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.280]   Here's the note featuring the great seal at the top. Sorry you were out when I visited. I
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.840]   looked forward to seeing you in the office very soon with every good wish, the right honorable
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:34.240]   Jacob Reesmog, MP, Minister for Brexit opportunities. There's a title, and I think it's very nice that
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:41.520]   it's pinned to green bays, which is nice. It's very British. Very nice. It looks like he had these
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:50.080]   printed up. Please think before printing this passive aggressive email, that's what they should
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.000]   be adding into Google Docs. Yes, do you really realize you sound like a twit?
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:03.040]   There's a balance that we have to strike. There are definitely some
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:08.480]   work spaces that need at least a minimum of interaction between people. It does help in the
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:14.400]   creative process. It helps in sorting things out quickly. However, office managers have to come to
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.560]   grips with the fact that we've proven that they're useless in many situations, that employees work
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.320]   much better when they don't have an office manager hovering over their shoulder, that they'll get
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:30.720]   as much or more done on their own. Now the question becomes, all right, what are we paying people for?
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.400]   Are we paying them to fill a space at a desk? Are we paying them for productivity? Are we paying
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:38.880]   them to be part of a team in which they collaborate and cooperate with their fellow workers?
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.200]   I think this is a big issue. I think there are some managers who don't get it,
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:48.960]   but I think the vast majority of managers will, if they're not by themselves or forced by their
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.680]   employees, one or the other. It's going to in the long run have a beneficial effect that this industrial
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:59.520]   era mentality of sitting at a desk nine to five Monday through Friday, I think that's almost over.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.000]   California is actually considering a four-day work week, a 36-hour work week.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.640]   I think that we need grants. They pass laws to ban you from being forced to check emails
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:17.360]   after hours. You can go pretty heavy-handed. I love that. You know why you have to do that?
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:21.840]   You get fined, right? Yeah, because their bosses will say, I sent you an email at 2am. Why did you
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:28.560]   not respond? Yep. That was the other thing. Go ahead. No, go ahead. Listen.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.000]   Yeah, I was going to mention, aside from more flexibility in terms of where you're working,
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.720]   I do feel like the pandemic has raised awareness about burnout and the culture around burnout.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.640]   Because I think at first, when we all started working from home, the opposite was happening.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:50.480]   You're home. There's not much else to do because you can't really go anywhere. I think a lot of
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.600]   people probably ended up working more in the early days of the pandemic, especially us in the news
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:59.840]   industry for sure, because there was so much going on that we needed to be covering. But
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:08.480]   I do think that it has brought up a good conversation around burnout and having managers be aware of
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.280]   burnout and drawing that line between your personal and your work life when it all starts to kind of
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:20.240]   blend together as it has over the past couple of years. I love it. I follow the anti-work subreddit,
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:26.160]   which has really actually helped open my eyes to how awful some workplaces are. I'm glad
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.760]   workers are standing up and saying, "Yeah, that's not okay. We're not going to stand for this."
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:38.080]   I feel bad for the younger generation now, faced with jobs that are so pitifully paid and
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:43.440]   mark so many hours that all they can basically do is work, eat, sleep. They'll never own a home.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:47.920]   They'll never be able to put any money aside. That's not right. That's not how this is supposed to be.
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:53.440]   I, for one, would like to blame the oligarchs because they're doing just fine.
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:59.600]   Just fine. These last two years have been fantastic for the wealthy.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:07.280]   Remember, the first time in the history of our country, the top 1% of wealth is concentrated
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:14.080]   into people who own more than the next 60%. Income inequalities can be a massive problem in the US.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:23.600]   COVID lockdowns in Shanghai, however, proceed apace. They are now starting to fence in people.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:31.680]   39 fatalities yesterday bringing the total number of virus-related deaths to 87 since late February.
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:38.000]   That doesn't sound like a lot, but the Chinese Communist Party's policy is zero COVID.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:46.560]   They are anxious to have no COVID. They are sealing up buildings, locking people in.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:53.840]   There's been food insecurity due to that. From our point of view, one of the concerns is,
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:59.600]   many of the factories in Shanghai are shut down. Some are saying the supply chain shortages
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.680]   we're currently experiencing will get nothing but worse to shut down.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:13.200]   I don't know whether it's merited. The Chinese government had up to not done a very good job
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:18.640]   fighting COVID, but it is a real problem right now for workers.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:25.520]   We have had guests from China, from Hong Kong, from Shanghai, from Shenzhen, come into Rome.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:32.080]   The actual numbers are way, way higher. They're not reporting all the deaths.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.680]   They're not reporting. Of course not.
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:42.320]   Now they're fencing people in. These green fences from the BBC, of course, green fences
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.760]   being installed outside of buildings to keep people inside.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:56.960]   25 million people in Shanghai all shut inside in their homes to prevent the spread of COVID.
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:05.840]   Let's take a little break. I hope you and your loved ones are well and surviving.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:12.240]   Our show today brought to you by Noom. If you would like to start a healthier lifestyle,
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:21.040]   I know for me and Lisa, it's been a boon. We love Noom. Of course, one of the things I consider
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:27.680]   myself a diet expert. I knew them all, done them all. But what I hadn't really considered is the
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:34.080]   psychology of eating. That's what Noom was so great for. It's really not a diet.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:41.520]   Noom will head you on a path to a better health with a psychology-based approach.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:46.640]   Changes the way you think about food improves your understanding of why you eat when you eat.
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:52.160]   I, for example, and everybody's different, but I am a fog eater. I will eat unconsciously.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:57.920]   And Noom helped me become more conscious about my eating, chewing, putting down my fork, turning
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.640]   off the TV, turning off the phone while I eat to really enjoy my food. You know what? I enjoy it
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:08.880]   more and I eat less. Noom's psychological approach is based on scientific principles like cognitive
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:15.600]   behavioral therapy. CBT really works. It helps you understand your relationship with food and then
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.160]   build sustainable habits that last a lifetime. One of the things that surprised me about Noom
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.680]   when I first started and I've been doing it for about a year is they said there's no bad foods.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:31.920]   We don't demonize food. It's not about there's bad foods and good foods. That's not what this
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:38.720]   is all about. Noom doesn't believe in restricting what you can or cannot eat. It just helps you know
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:44.000]   better what you're doing. So you're doing it consciously and kind of almost magically,
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:50.640]   you lose weight, you get healthier, you get more fit. Noom understands that building these long-term
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:57.280]   positive habits is hard. It can be filled with ups and downs. They say it's not about perfection.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:02.800]   It's about progress. Everybody's journey looks different. With Noom, you get an app. You can track
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:07.760]   everything you're eating and drinking and all the exercise you're doing. You get coaching from
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:13.200]   Noom just a few minutes every day to learn these good habits. You also get a personal coach and
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:19.440]   you get a group that you're in it together and all of that really helps. Noom is grounded in
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.680]   science. It's the heart of everything they do. In fact, they take this so seriously, they've
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:30.400]   published more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific articles that inform users but also practitioners
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:36.080]   and scientists in the public about how the methods work and how well they work. And I can tell you,
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:42.720]   Lisa and I both love Noom. It's really changed our lifestyle. I started doing it and she said,
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.480]   "Oh, I'm going to do it to support you," which was really nice. We've been eating that way and
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:53.920]   eating really right for a year now. And it's been so great. Our son has lost weight too,
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:49:00.240]   joining us on this Noom journey. It's incredible. And you don't have to worry about things like,
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.520]   I always hate diets because you one bad day, one day off, and, "Oh, it's all over." And you throw
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:12.320]   it in, not with Noom. They help you get back on track. There are no bad days. You decide how
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.600]   Noom weight fits into your life, not the other way around. You can spend five, 10, 15 minutes a day
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:26.480]   reading. That's up to you. There's always extra if you want. It changes how I shop. It changes how
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:32.240]   I look at food, how I think about it. And the best thing for me is, and this is personal,
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:37.920]   this is about me, but if I saw food, I would eat it. If there's food on the counter,
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:44.240]   if there's food in our kitchen here at work, I will eat it. There's been treats sitting on that
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.800]   counter at work. There's always treats. There's candy, there's cakes. And I feel really good. I
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:53.280]   don't have to force myself. I just have the knowledge of, "Oh, yeah, you're going to foggy.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.840]   Go ahead. Put that in your mouth. Go ahead." So when I do eat it, it's conscious and it's a
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:03.360]   decision. It's incredible. Start building better habits today. We are huge fans of Noom.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.880]   It's been really good for us. Many of the people we know have started doing it as a result.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:12.400]   Sign up for your trial. Noomn-o-o-m.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.280]   .com/twit. When you first sign up, there's a questionnaire that is the beginning of the process.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:23.040]   You're going to really learn about what your relationship is to food. It's just even that by
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:28.240]   itself is great. N-o-o-m.com/twit to sign up for your trial.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:35.200]   Noomn-o-o-m.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:42.720]   Look better. Be more confident. And for me, the most important part was this struggle that I have
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:49.520]   always had with eating and dieting and weight just has disappeared. No more struggle. I love that.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.440]   If it were just that, that enough would be a lot. That alone would be enough.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:51:00.480]   Noomn-o-o-m.com/twit. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you, Noomn. And Lisa, thanks you too.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:08.320]   Okay. Let's get back to these stories. No, during that ad, I signed up for Noomn.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:13.280]   Did you really? I had all my information and it said I could hit my target weight by March 14th
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:16.960]   of next year. Wouldn't that feel good? That would be incredible.
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:21.360]   Wouldn't that feel good? Yeah. I think I had to cut off a leg.
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:28.000]   But no, no, no, no, no. The number one thing is you're logging. And I think just by itself
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.480]   logging, writing down everything you eat just completely changes it. You know, because you just
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:35.280]   don't unconsciously put something in your mouth. You have to write it down.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:42.160]   I have mixed feelings about this. I'm a great friend with Kevin Rose. I love Kevin Rose.
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:53.120]   He has gotten together with people, the digital artist, Gary Vaynerchuk. They created a company
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:52:02.080]   called the Proof Collective. And they designed 10,000 cartoon owls,
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:13.520]   a thousand NFT collectors, some of the biggest names in NFTs. They initially, and I, maybe I'm
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:18.560]   just mad at Kevin because he didn't tell me when they launched, I could have bought in at $7,900.
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:27.360]   The minimum price now for one of these owls. Remember, they, if you got in at the bottom, $7,900,
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:38.960]   $285,000 of the 10,000 moonbirds, 7,000 were given away from a raffle, 2,000 for members,
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:46.160]   and 125 for distribution by the moonbird team. They have sold hundreds of millions of dollars,
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:52.720]   $281 million in sales volume. And Kevin and company, the founders of Proof Collective,
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:59.440]   have taken home $50 million. And all they had to do was create some cartoon owls.
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:07.280]   So I'm just curious. Kevin made a video explaining, no, we're going to do something good with the
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:14.560]   money really. I'm just curious. And I bring this up a lot. No one has yet to convince me that this
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:21.600]   is anything but a speculative bubble. I like that the screenshot that you showed was dated April 1st.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:30.880]   It almost feels like it is, but it's not. Yeah, yeah, you could get a an owl with devil's horns or
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:36.240]   an angel's halo. You can get an owl in a space helmet. You can get a robot owl, an owl with
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:42.480]   the duck on its head. You know, there are some very needy owls in the world that could use your
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:49.360]   money in the form of a donation so they don't die than this. And I don't mean to bring the tone down,
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:54.720]   but give some of that money to do some good. Yeah, if they're going to do that, great. I hope
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:02.640]   they do. Otherwise, Kevin, I love Kevin trust him his podcast on DeFi and crypto is great. And
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:06.080]   I've learned a lot, including how NFTs work. I've yet to see
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:13.440]   anything that makes this anything other than a pyramid scheme. To be a tool of
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:18.720]   it's worse than a tool. Absolutely. It's worse than a tool because people are buying these not
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:24.480]   because they love these owls. Maybe some people do, but mostly because they think somebody's going
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:29.920]   to come along and pay more than they did. Right? What happened with with Jack Dorsey's first tweet.
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.040]   It can't sell. No, no, and it makes me happy because the guy who bought it is now out a couple
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:45.840]   of million dollars. Yeah. He spent what 2.9 million for again, it's an NFT. So you don't I mean,
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:57.120]   the tweet doesn't like go in your pocket. It doesn't become part of your physical possessions. You just
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:05.360]   have kind of some tenuous link to it. The guy who bought it 2.9 million hasn't been able to find
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:12.640]   a buyer for more than a few thousand. So he's out almost three million dollars. Of course,
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:16.880]   the guy who bought it. Anyone who's going to make a copy of it, anyone else can have it. I can tell
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:23.120]   you what it is. Yeah. You have a link. You have a tenuous grasp on the ownership of said thing,
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:29.520]   but no way to really enforce your ownership of said thing. I mean, okay, I get it. It is a
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.640]   speculative instrument, just like most everything in the financial world. And if you can make money
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:39.920]   on it, because someone else is willing to pay you for it, great. Awesome. But I'm like you, Leo.
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:44.720]   This is this is one of these things where everyone is just waiting for the music to stop and they
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:50.320]   want to be not there when it stops. It's a little telling the guy about Jack Dorsey's tweet when he
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:54.800]   bought it said, this is not just a tweet. I think years later, people will realize the true value
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:56:00.720]   of this tweet like the Mona Lisa painting. That's the guy who wants to sell it. Yeah. And then a
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:10.080]   year later, he puts it up for auction. Not a lot. Not a lot. The highest bid. I don't know, I think
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:14.960]   $13,000, but I think it's even less. And when you take out the gas fees, that's the other problem.
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.280]   The people who are really making money on this, the people who are generating the NFT.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:30.160]   All right. I don't want to pile on or anything. I love Kevin Rose, but I am skeptical of all this,
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:39.760]   and I will not be buying any board owls or board apes or zombies. Do you have any NFTs, Lisa? Did you
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:48.400]   buy buy in at the bottom? I don't. I am right there with you. I still kind of skeptical and
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:54.880]   personally trying to figure out what's going on with NFTs. It's not an area that I am very well
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:57:01.040]   versed in. Maybe I need to listen to Kevin's podcast a bit more about it. You should. It's the
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:06.240]   first episode of modern. It's called the Modern Finance Podcast. He has an NFC guy on, and he's
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:14.480]   probably why Kevin ended up doing the proof collective. At least with tulips, you got a bulb,
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:20.000]   right? You don't. This is out of sync in the chat room saying, no, no, crypto is tulip bulbs.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.960]   NFTs are pictures of tulip bulbs.
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:30.480]   And I wouldn't even say NFTs are pictures of tulip bulbs. I think NFTs are the description
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:34.480]   of a picture of a tulip bulb. That's getting closer.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:41.600]   Yeah. By the way, I should say Kevin bought advertising on Twit for Modern Finance,
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:48.640]   and by the way, I still agree with it. It's a great podcast. I think my problem is not if people who
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:56.160]   are in the crypto arena are buying this stuff fine. You know what you're doing. You're probably
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:02.000]   spending your doge coin that you only bought for pennies for it anyway, right? It's not like
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:07.680]   you're spending real money, but where I draw the lines would start to promote this to people who are
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:14.480]   not in the crypto sphere. And they have to because it's only worth something if they can get somebody
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:20.000]   to pay more for it. So all of this enthusiasm, all of this excitement, all these people saying,
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.800]   it's the next big thing. What they're really saying is, please buy this thing I bought.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:31.520]   It's worth anything unless you buy it for more than I paid for it. And that's what bothers me.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:37.600]   So I kind of want to keep hitting this because I want people who are on the fence or saying,
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:41.200]   well, that's interesting. Or maybe there's something there or being persuaded by all the
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:45.200]   crypto bros who say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread's got to change the world
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:51.680]   to think twice a little bit because there is no, I don't there's no inherent value. It's a.
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:56.720]   There's a difference between telling someone that they're gambling, which is what a financial
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:01.280]   advisor will do say this is a speculative instrument. It may make money. You may lose money.
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:05.920]   And telling people it is an investment. Those people who are telling others that NFTs are
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:10.160]   investments that will only go up in value. That's wrong morally ethically.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:13.440]   Well, now we know because we know that's not true. Yeah, it's not.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:24.160]   Yeah, there was some ads that ran on the London underground a little while ago about
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:27.360]   by investing in Bitcoin. And I think the wording was something like,
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:33.920]   if you're seeing ads for Bitcoin on the tube, it's time to buy. And they got in trouble for it and
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:40.800]   had to pull the ads. And it was really interesting because actually, if you're seeing ads for Bitcoin
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:50.320]   on the tube, chances are it's probably a good time to sell. And I don't think the irony of that
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:56.960]   was lost on the regulator who said you can't put this out on for that exact reason,
[01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:04.320]   because it's disingenuous at best. And it is repugnant at worst,
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:10.160]   getting people to think that it's an investment when it's speculation and it's gambling.
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:18.800]   Well, it's sort of like when your parents are on Facebook, it's time to get off on Facebook.
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:19.840]   Yeah. Yeah.
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:28.480]   I don't I is my is my are my mom and dad on Facebook. I'm not on Facebook.
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:34.560]   HBO creating a Minecraft movie.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:43.360]   Jason Aquaman with Aquaman, which is very confusing. Jason Momoa Aquaman will start,
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:48.480]   but starring quotes, no one knows. Is he going to play Steve? Who is he going to play?
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:55.360]   Is it I think it's a live action. They say live action Minecraft movie.
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:58.160]   Is it a blockbuster?
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:08.880]   I'll give you eight bits for a ticket. Yeah, I mean, Minecraft is huge. In December,
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:17.120]   Minecraft videos surpassed a trillion views on YouTube. In 2021, last year, there were over a
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:25.040]   140 million monthly active users playing Minecraft. So, you know, it makes sense to make a movie.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:34.800]   The director Jared Hess did Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. So you know, it's going to be good.
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:41.920]   That's that's quality. I just the only way I see this working is if it's it's a movie about like
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:46.240]   the Minecraft community, not actually a movie about what's happening in Minecraft. Yeah.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.720]   Yeah, and that would actually be interesting. I would like that. I would enjoy it. Oh, no,
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:56.560]   that's fascinating. Yeah, but I don't think it's that. Yeah, I mean, Minecraft is huge,
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.520]   so it'll probably make a lot of money. But I'm skeptical because I feel like there aren't many
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:07.920]   video game based movies that are actually good. I mean, there's been a lot of there was Sonic.
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:14.080]   Yeah, maybe Sonic. Super Mario Brothers was incredible. Okay. No, it wasn't. You lie. You lie.
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:21.200]   You're lying. You're lying. You're just lying now. How do you like your Oreos? Do you eat them all
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:26.720]   at once, Lisa? Or do you open them up and eat the cream first? Or you dunk them in milk? What's
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:32.960]   your Oreo strategy? I usually open them up. I flop back and forth though. Sometimes I just eat it
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:39.200]   like a regular cookie, but I don't know. You'll be interested in this. The study of why Oreo cream
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:48.560]   filling usually sticks to one side. They're calling it Oreology. And MIT has actually published a paper
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:58.400]   in the journal Physics of Fluid, the co-author, a graduate student at MIT, Crystal Owens,
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:07.440]   primarily studies 3D printing with comics. You got some Oreos there. Go ahead, twist it.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:18.160]   Oh, wow. You should mail that to her right now because that completely contradicts the
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:24.560]   conclusions. Did you warm that Oreo up? Had you pre spilled it? I literally just took it out of
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:29.680]   the package right now. I love it. My own research. You are not on noon. You have a package of Oreos
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:35.280]   right there. Oh boy. That is actually this could be a good test. Are you going to eat it or put it
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:41.120]   back in the box? It doesn't look garbage. I know you're into 3D printing. I don't know what 3D
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:47.760]   printing with complex fluid inks is, but complex fluids are all around us, she says.
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:56.800]   Many foods, sauces, condiments, yogurt, ice cream, and other products are complex fluids.
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:02.000]   You know, like near their solid nor liquid, I guess. I don't know. I think that's like some sort of
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.120]   fluid in suspension. Yeah. It's a complex. Yeah. Yeah. So she designed a tool
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:19.200]   to twist the Oreo. It's an Oreo stress
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:28.000]   reometer, R-H-E-O-M-E-T-E-R. It twists the fluid between parallel disks in order to measure its
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:35.280]   viscosity. She had a epiphany looking staring at her reometer, said, "Oh, wait a minute. I could use
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:45.600]   that to study Oreo breakage." So I proposed my idea to my research advisor and the project
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:51.600]   was born. Turns out Oreos are a canonical example of parallel plate
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:05:00.720]   geometry. The cookies are an everyday trilayer laminate composite. The cream is the fluid sample
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:05.760]   and the two wafers are the parallel plates counter rotating the wafers. That's what you just did,
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:13.680]   Robert, causes the cream to shear and flow before fracturing as the two wafers come apart. But your
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:20.560]   results, your results are completely contrary to the results of the study because- Shall we try again?
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:24.800]   Yeah, do another one. Okay, so counterclockwise, right? Well, any way you want-
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:27.360]   counter? No, you're allowed. Counterclockwise.
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:33.760]   They're like distributing a drum roll. That one? No, you have special Vatican Oreos. That's
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:38.960]   their speed. There's something she said, "I had in my mind if you twist the Oreos perfectly,
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:45.200]   as Robert just did, you should split the cream perfectly in the middle." But what actually happens,
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:53.200]   contrary to our own research, I might point out, is the cream almost always comes off on one side.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:59.200]   The cream distribution is not affected by rotation rate. The amount of cream filling
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:06.880]   or the flavor, they got double stuff. They got all kinds of flavors. They tried in all different
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:12.960]   ways with the reometer. She does say the rotation rate does play an important role in whether or not
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:18.720]   the cookies break apart cleanly. If you try to twist the Oreos faster, you can do another one,
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:26.960]   Robert. Try it fast. It's harder the faster you twist. So if you're stressed and desperate to
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:34.960]   open your cookie, do it a little slower. But- Oh, no. Jeez, Louise. These are defective Oreos.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:38.480]   These are defective- Actually, these might be counterfeit Oreos.
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:42.080]   Oh, that's what it is. You're not- Oh, they're hydrox. I can tell.
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:51.760]   Those are hydrox. Those ain't Oreos. Anyway, so you're just with your own empirical results.
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:58.160]   Just as the Vatican and the Jesuits have always been known to do, you have completely destroyed.
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:03.600]   It's what we do. That's what you do, the scientific paper, with your own investigation.
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:10.320]   But by the way, if you want to do the studies at home, they have open sourced their 3D printed
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:17.200]   Oreo meter. So you could use it at home or in the classroom. Oh, I am so printing that thing up.
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:20.800]   You should. Cookies can be mounted onto two clamps powered by rubber bands.
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:26.320]   Powered may not be the right word there. The next step is to load pennies one by one into either
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:32.560]   two symmetric penny castles. Thereby applying torque and precise increments use new pennies for
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:37.680]   the best results. When they tested their Oreometer in the lab, they achieved similar results.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:43.520]   Leo, I'm going to make you one of these, except I'm going to power it with a stepper motor and an
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:52.560]   Arduino. All right, baby. Let's make this real. I don't think I've ever had an Oreo. What?
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:08:00.000]   What? What? I mean, how does it anomaly it? That's- Wow. You eat some sort of weird British
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:09.760]   biscuit that tastes like malted barley. We have something called a custard cream. Custard cream.
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:16.160]   And a ball of biscuit. We admit they don't have Oreos in England. But we probably do.
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:18.960]   They've got Oreos. They've got Oreos. They've got Oreos.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:23.520]   Are you going to have Oreos in every country of the world? I'm sure we do. I've just never had one.
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:28.080]   But now I'm thinking, could you apply this to the custard cream or the ball from biscuit?
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:34.960]   Don't chat, room. I hate to tell you this, Nate, says that your drum skins look like open Oreos.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:45.360]   So you may have had Oreos. It just never knew it. Okay. You just never, never knew it.
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:50.320]   All right. One more break. Then we have more silly stories to wrap this up. Fabulous panel.
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.920]   Great to have all three of you. I would like to talk instead about our sponsor for this segment,
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:02.640]   Wealthfront. If you want to buy some silly owls, fine, go right ahead. Stock trading can be fun.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:07.040]   It's like, as you said, it's like gambling. But the thrill of risking all is best enjoyed in
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:12.800]   moderation, like casino gambling and eating street food. If you're playing the market,
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:18.720]   I hope for your sake, you're stashing some safer money in a place like Wealthfront.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:28.800]   Wealthfront is not day trading. Wealthfront is a way to invest using well researched,

[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:09.680]   Yeah, you can get in a crypto this way, but this is a little bit better way to get into crypto or
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:16.800]   clean energy or cannabis even emerging markets. You get to choose. But the point of it is that

[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:07.280]   so much for supporting this week and tech you support us to when you use the URLs our advertisers
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:14.480]   give you like this one wealthfront.com/twit. We had a fun week this week on Twit. We even made
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:21.280]   a little video for you to watch and enjoy. Mr. Jarvis, Mr. Bursh says that I was supposed to ask you
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:27.920]   about your appearance on moonlighting. Oh yeah, very famous. Everybody knows about that. I don't.
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:32.960]   I have right here a tape of last week's episode and I'll show you all the good parts. It won't take long.
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:42.080]   Previously on Twit, Mac Break Weekly. Apple is ready in several new Macs with next generation M2
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:49.840]   chips as many as nine Macs according to developer logs. That's something Apple tries to avoid because
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:54.400]   a lot of times people who are testing these devices they put apps on them and then the developer gets
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:59.200]   logs back and sometimes there's unique characteristics about future devices tech news weekly. I was
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:04.800]   talking last week about CNN Plus and how folks were a little bit concerned that CNN Plus was not
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:10.720]   doing so well that the subscribers were not doing well etc. It looks like things are a little bit
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:15.440]   more interesting than we thought. It appears that CNN Plus is going to be shut down.
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:20.800]   This week in Google. No good terrible day for Netflix yesterday. They had to announce for the
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:27.920]   first time ever a loss of subscribers. Netflix is saying we're going to start looking at ads
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:32.720]   supported. I don't want ads in my Netflix. I think that could go the other way for them, right?
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:38.640]   I always enjoy watching one time innovators. Now huge and successful pivot to turf protection.
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:43.840]   It always involves using all kinds of distorted logic to justify making their product worse to
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:52.080]   please investors to it. It keeps going and going and going and the great Jim Cutler. Thank you, Jim.
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:57.760]   Does all our voice announcing he's so he's been doing it since tech TV days. We love you Jim.
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:04.720]   Jim and Don are the best. Thank you. Thank you for that. It is now legal to watch TV
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:10.800]   behind the wheel of a self-driving vehicle in the UK. Congratulations Nate. Get on out there.
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:16.320]   Watch your movies. I don't even drive. Well that's good because there are currently no such
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:25.360]   vehicles available in the UK. There are some really interesting caveats to this. One is that it has
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:31.040]   to be or will have to be on a screen that is part of the vehicle. So it has to be on a built-in
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:37.760]   display. It will still be illegal to use your phone in a car. Wait a minute. You can watch TV
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:43.120]   but you can't use your phone? That's law today. It's illegal to use your phone if you're driving.
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:48.560]   Yeah but even having it in your hand. Yeah. It seems like watching TV would be equally distracting.
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:55.840]   Well I think the argument is that if the way that it's written is basically if you're stuck in
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:05.440]   traffic on a motorway, on a highway and you're going very very very slowly then it's okay or
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:10.240]   rather than it will be okay because they want to make sure that you're able to take the wheel if
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:15.120]   you need to really quickly and having a phone in your hand means you may be impaired at doing
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:19.920]   that quickly. I think also the argument is maybe that if you're looking at it on the screen then
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:24.000]   you're paying attention to something the car can alert you on as well. That's right. Obviously
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.800]   won't happen on a phone. So there is some logic to it and the other thing that came out as part of
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:36.960]   this same announcement though is that if a self-driving vehicle causes an accident then it is on the
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:45.520]   insurer to pay. Aha! Not the manufacturer. Interesting. Yeah so a lot of the questions are now going to
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:50.960]   be well what insurer is going to get to ensure a self-driving car if they know that if it has a
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:57.760]   problem it's on them to pay up. So it's quite interesting. So for example if say Tesla just
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:03.200]   ran into a multi-million dollar aircraft because someone used a summon feature. Oh did you see that
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:10.400]   video? In sure. Oh my god. Let me see if I can find that. It's amazing. Absolutely amazing. It was a
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:16.880]   nice jet too. It wasn't just a hit it. It hit it and then it obviously didn't know what was happening
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:21.920]   because it kept pushing it. It kept going right through it. It's kind of hard to see this. This is
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:27.840]   the tweet from or actually it's from the subreddit Flying. Let me start it. Let me start this over
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:35.120]   again. Let's see if I can make a little bit bigger on Reddit. So this was at an air show right and
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:42.560]   this is these are these vision jets I guess are personal jets. Here comes the car. Whoops.
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:51.040]   Oh he's actually turning the jet around and he doesn't stop until he maybe I had the
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:57.360]   owners coming along to stop it. He's using something I had on my Tesla for three years and never dared
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:04.640]   to use the summon feature where you press a button and the Tesla slowly drives to come and get you.
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:10.880]   I never trusted it and it turns out I was right although I don't have a lot of jets in my parking
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:17.520]   in my driveway but still still to be fair to be fair who trains the machine learning algorithm
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:23.280]   for a car on whether it can recognize a plane if you've got a plane you're feeling in your car
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:27.040]   you've got bigger problems. That's a good point. What did what did the car what did the car think?
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:33.040]   Oh I I'm imagining it. Oh no that can't really be there. The vision jets are three and a half
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:40.800]   million dollars. We don't know if the insurance covered the loss or not. Well they would hit
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:47.440]   actually yeah well but so you don't have any full self-driving vehicles there even the Teslas
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:53.520]   don't do FSD there. No they don't. They don't. No you can do like the lane assist stuff but we
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:57.920]   don't we don't have any here yet but also remember it's a pretty small country like loads of people
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:02.960]   don't drive here because we just don't need it. That's sensible. I you know I increasingly
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:08.320]   feel like it'd be nice if we just banned all personal vehicles in urban centers.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.840]   You know it's extremely expensive to take a car into London. Yeah as it should be.
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:19.360]   20, 25, 30 pounds a day just to take your car in so people are like I live here what's the point?
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:22.480]   Don't need a car. It's more than that in San Francisco. We have people trolling.
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:28.320]   We have people trolling Tesla just to be wrong right now. Oh you have to pay a fee to get in?
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:33.360]   Just to be just to just to get in. Yeah wow because they don't want you in there. If you want
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.720]   a park then yeah you're going to get in the war. Yeah so you have people doing what
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:45.760]   we're trolling Tesla so that you can buy shirts or jackets that have stop signs printed on the back
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:52.320]   than if you're walking in front of a Tesla it makes the Tesla stop. At least it stops.
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:56.480]   And I've seen it happen three or four times. It's actually kind of funny.
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:02.240]   Actually the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration is investigating now
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:10.560]   officially as of this week Tesla's autopilot software to see whether it's safe. They've actually
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:23.840]   launched two formal investigations into it. Let's see the... I don't have any more details than that
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:31.680]   but they are launching the investigation. We'll keep an eye on that. I don't know if I think
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:38.640]   honestly in this case it's the driver who's responsible if you're using FSD to keep his eyes
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:45.440]   out for any issues and to take control of their art issues right. It's not self-driving really.
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:53.840]   Well the name does say full self-driving. If you thought spam was getting better you are wrong.
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:01.760]   Spam Americans according to Axios are drowning in spam not just spam email but spam text messaging
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:12.880]   which is now outpaced spam robo calls as of last month there were 7.6 billion spam phone calls in
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:22.800]   the US. 11.7 billion spam text messages and I have to tell you I'm not surprised because I get calls
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:28.080]   all the time from very nice people usually older people saying why are they sending me text messages
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:34.880]   about porn all the time and how do I stop it? You know I wonder if I feel like a lot of this.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:40.320]   Oh no I was just going to say I feel like a lot of this is probably because a lot of the tech
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:45.680]   companies have made tools for filtering robo calls over the past few years like that technology
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:50.640]   has gotten better so I feel like a lot of these scammers are now turning to text messages to do
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:57.760]   that because it just hasn't caught up as much. Well and the FCC has kind of delayed the implementation
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:03.120]   of the technology that's supposed to stop spam texts and spam phone calls the shurka
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:10.560]   shurka stirred and shaken framework they allowed the big companies are all doing it but they can
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:18.160]   allow through calls from small companies until the end of I think it's the end of May companies
[02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:24.720]   small phone companies with no facilities will have to use stir and shaken to authenticate which
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:29.520]   means a phone company say hey if you don't say who this is from we're not going to take it that
[02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:34.720]   will do a lot to stop this and then I think at the end of the year small phone companies that have
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:40.720]   facilities like buildings will have to stop so I think what's also happening is this is a last
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:47.360]   I'm hoping anyway this is the last gasp for spam texts because as soon as stir and shaken is implemented
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:56.240]   uh AT&T T-Mobile uh Verizon can can and should legally say you know unless you say who you are
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:01.520]   and you can identify that authenticate that we're not going to accept that I think that'll solve it
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:06.720]   I hope I hope so I've been getting so many I mean like a lot of people have been getting so many of
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:12.160]   them especially in the last few months I feel like it's picked up a lot so I really hope that
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:20.880]   absolutely has yeah uh what do we do over here it that stops it I never get spam on my Italian
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:25.360]   number I get it all the time on my US number oh that's interesting I never get any either what
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:32.560]   really are we doing something different here uh literally I nothing that's bizarre because it's
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:38.720]   and it's non-stop right Lisa yeah it's like I wouldn't say it's daily for me but it's probably
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:45.440]   probably multiple times per week I would say yeah I get of course you get the calls for your
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:54.160]   auto warranties expired all of that uh you get the text messages you know just attack settlements
[02:21:54.160 --> 02:22:01.200]   tax settlements there's one yeah or I get a lot of fake banking ones yeah um it's fishing yeah
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:06.640]   yeah they're fishing scams yeah well your phone company's supposed to block it let's hope they
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:15.120]   start uh doing that soon and finally chopsticks to make your food saltier
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:22.160]   without I love this additional salt I think you got to make these researchers in Japan have
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:29.440]   developed a set of electric chopsticks they're attached to a wristband computer it uses electrical
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:35.760]   stimulation to transmit sodium ions from the food to the eater's mouth
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:44.720]   this is uh according to Meiji University professor home amia shita who developed the chopsticks with
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:53.280]   kirin who of course makes food uh soy sauce uh I think there's kirin beer by the way this is not
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:59.280]   his first time to this rodeo if that's what you call it he's the guy who designed the lickable
[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:07.520]   tv yes not great it would let you taste whatever you see on the screen the chopsticks do require
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:15.920]   you to wear at least in this first iteration uh a little wrist computer um researchers say the
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:23.280]   chopsticks can enhance the perceived saltiness of foods one and a half times so you know it could
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:31.120]   be a lifesaver it certainly is birth control so either way you're you're ahead
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:40.320]   uh and on that note I would be willing to test those I mean seriously I love salt I mean salt
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:44.000]   I'm not supposed to have it but I don't salt yep all right let's do it
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:51.840]   Lisa and a Chico you're the greatest thank you so much for being here spending your evening with us
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:56.640]   yeah thank you for having me anytime senior editor at cnet anything you want to plug
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:04.160]   um just keep checking out cnet we have a lot of great reviews and news coverage every day so
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:10.160]   just yeah keep checking it out thank you it's great to have you it's great to have you Nate Langson
[02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:16.720]   tech editor at Bloomberg you stayed up late for us what is it one in the morning it is I'm sorry
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:22.320]   thank you thank you we love having you on really appreciate it anything you
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:29.360]   oh I know we're gonna plug UK Tech show your podcast my podcast yeah text message which is at
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:36.160]   UK Tech show calm um I get it text message that's one message you won't want a block
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:43.520]   yeah and that's why the the URL is UK Tech show calm because it's a it's a play on words that
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:49.040]   works better written down than it does right and I got sick of saying t-e-c-h apostrophe s
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:54.640]   message oh I get it now I get it now so I just thought right script um but yeah we actually did
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:59.840]   talk a lot about the self-driving car stuff uh on the episode that went out earlier today um I
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:04.080]   think that's episode 272 so yeah I'd love people to check that out and give us a follow if you
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:10.960]   like what I say and how I say it great show tech goes down better with an English accent I
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:16.320]   just have to say it really does sounds smarter thank you posture yeah it does that's why I listen
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:22.880]   to the F1 racing as well oh you they have the best-announced series in F1 racing the lights
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:31.360]   are out in the molar you like crafty yeah he's so good I love him I love him uh so you're becoming
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:38.720]   F1 fan as well huh I've been I was I had been watching F1 for about eight years it's really high
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:45.440]   tech you stop this season oh this is because the way last season ended no I know that's why you
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:51.120]   got to watch this season they've made changes in the rules there's more overtaking it's much more
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:57.200]   balanced there's limits on what they can spend it's actually they've transformed the the sport
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:01.840]   says somebody's been watching it same same reason why stop watching the NFL you know if you don't
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:08.000]   care enough to to guard the integrity of your sport then why should I watch okay fair enough but
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.200]   yeah yeah father robber balancer the digital Jesuit padre's corner is back
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:22.480]   it is uh intermittently youtube.com/digitaljazuit or just go to twitter.com/padreistra you're always
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:28.880]   gonna find whatever I'm working on at the time a lot of stuff unfortunately I can't post because
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:35.040]   I don't really make my own content uh the majority of the time anymore but it's fun you get an
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:39.840]   inside look at what happens on this corner of the of the globe are they are they keeping you busy
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:48.160]   now doing like priest stuff uh the amount of priest the priest stuff that I do is actually
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:55.360]   it's pretty minimal because they need my other my other oh the technical skills yeah I do the
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:59.760]   priest stuff for me because I don't feel right if I'm not consistently going out there but they
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:03.600]   need the technical and the production and the content creation skills those are the things that
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:09.280]   are being used every day oh that's interesting so uh increased social presence and of course the
