[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this week in Tech. Episode 30 for November 12th, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   [music]
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   We're back in front of the live audience, but this is a special audience because about
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   three-quarters of its audience are these podcasters.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   How many of your podcasters?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Yeah!
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   What, the rest are pod listeners?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Pod listeners? How many of your pod listeners?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Yeah!
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   You know, pod listeners are every bit as important as podcasters, although I think there is soon
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   to be a one-to-one ratio.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Yep.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   A podcaster is to pod listeners. We're at the podcast Expo in beautiful Ontario, California.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Home of the truck stop.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Home of the freeway bypass.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Unbelievable place out in the inland empire.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   In the sanitation conference next door.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And we're right next door to the Port of San folks.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   You know, we're at the portable media expo.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I saw the portable sanitation expo. I almost went in and gave the keynote.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And I think it would have gone over really well, frankly.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Portable year passion.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   So this is a special edition of Twit because we are, as I said, at the podcast Expo.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   So we're going to talk to a lot of podcasters today on the show.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   But let me introduce our panel to begin.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Patrick was here yesterday and they had to go back home to make a dining room set for his wife
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   because they're having people for Thanksgiving.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Kevin was a no-show because he's got 2.8 million.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   What the hell does he need to come here for?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Well, he's in some strange country now, isn't he?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Is he?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Well, I'm in Europe.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I thought somewhere.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Yeah, de Vorex, ignoring my email again.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It happens.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Because he thought you were spam.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Maybe I'm spam.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   He gets no spam and he gets no Leo and he gets no email at all.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's a part of the spam thing.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   But there is a great cast of characters, including we're welcoming back Steve Gibson,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   grc.com.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   We love Steve.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Who happened to be in the neighborhood?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Happens to be next door, practically.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So that's really great.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Doug K of IT Conversations is back also.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Doug, it's great to have you.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It's fun to be here and only have one thing to say.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   What's that?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Light pen.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   He just remembers the light pen.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   The light pen I did for the Apple II.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That was Steve's first product.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And that's how I always remember Steve.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So this is the old side of the bench, right?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Here, me, Doug and Steve.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Right.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Where the old fathers.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   The founding fathers.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And then of course, to my left is Alex Lindsay, who's slightly younger of the Pixel Core.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We call it the Pimple Core.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   They're all so young.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   No.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Thanks to the Pixel Core for making this possible.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   We're going to do a video again.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   This is the first time we've done kind of like on the road video.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   With the new cameras and every else.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Did you drive all this down or did you drive it down?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Oh, yep.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It was fine.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It was five.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   With all the trucks.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And to begin kind of our roundtable of podcasters, digital bill from the Wizards of Technology,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   an old friend and a great friend.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And we're in a kilt in honor of Patrick Norton.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's right.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'll be playing the part of Patrick Norton today.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I think you do a pretty good job.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You got a sledgehammer with you?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I think Mark has it over there.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   How do you like my microphone?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   That is the best microphone I've heard.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Really good.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And the price was good for you.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   The price was right.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   This is a Hyle PR40.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And designed by, I didn't know this, the former sound guy for the Grateful Dead.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Hyle Sound does high-end audio.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And this was one of the prizes we won for being the People's Choice podcast for the show or whatever it is.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   The question will be, can it happen again?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Never.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I'm firmly of the opinion that the tech podcasts are on top now because that's who can get podcast.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   But I think by this time next year it'll be, I hope, it'll be a mainstream audience.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Don't you think Bill?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yeah, I do.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I mean, we've been walking around and the thing that was always amazing to me is how many people come up to us.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You know, as a tech podcast and they're like, "Oh, it's a Wizards of Technology.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We're not quite used to that."
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   But some of the guys that came up and talked to us are people who have their own podcast, the Raidercast,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   a guy that has a podcast about didgeridooze, right, the Australia?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I'd love that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   He says he knows both of the guys in San Francisco that play the didgeridoo.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's a small community, but powerful.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   They're way out on the long tail, right?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   These are the guys who are, but there's an interest for that.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And no matter what you have to talk about in podcasting, you have whatever your passion is,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   somebody's going to want to listen because you're not the only person that likes didgeridooze.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   There are other people that do.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Doug was telling a story about telling your knitting story.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Oh.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah, I was, when Odeo was first getting started, I was in their offices and we were joking about someday there'll be podcasts about knitting.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And Noah turned around and went to Google and put a knitting podcast and came up with two of them.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   One was, "Knitcast." I loved it because it was so perfect.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It was so tell me, how did you get started in knitting?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   There was a pearl one.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, "Knitcast" is good?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   You've listened to Leo?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   He's a closet knitted.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   No, I do knit.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I mean, I haven't knitted lately, but I know how to knit, and it's very soothing.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Well, I'm surprised you have time for knitting.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I don't have time for knitting.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   That's why I don't, you knit when you watch TV or you're doing something else, and when am I watching TV or doing something else?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Never anymore, so I could knit during Twit.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   You look very comfortable there Leo.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I am so comfortable with my high LPR-40 microphone.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I mean, I could do all sorts of things.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   The force is strong in this one.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   The mic is good too.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So, you said something, and I keep hearing at this conference digital bill, and I want to know what the hell is going on.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I know what the hell it means.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Long tail.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Oh, the long tail.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Everybody's talking about the frickin' long tail.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   You don't have one?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I don't...
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I had mine removed, actually.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It doesn't look good with the kill.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   You still have the bump though, I just...
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You noticed that.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Okay.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Okay.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   The long tail is the part of consumable stuff.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You can probably explain this better than me, Doug, but there's an initial high end of demand.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   The early adopters, you know, that are the first people to jump on to any...
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   So, what are the fat part of the tail?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   This whole audience is our early adopters.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So, it's kind of like a spermatozoa on the leading hedge.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It could be like that.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And then, you know, that demand tapers off in kind of this, you know, tail-shaped pattern.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But I think Amazon were the ones who kind of discovered it through all their data mining and so forth,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   is that they have a larger percentage of their total sales volume come from those small demand things,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   but there's just so many of them out there that it adds up to such a large volume there.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   So, the long tail really is important in an Internet sense when you have massive numbers.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Well, I remember that we all decided that the Internet is now not a fad.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Remember, the Internet itself was originally...
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Oh, that was just a fad.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   No, and I think also that the Netflix is a perfect example of someone who's like a full advantage of the long tail
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   where a lot of times what you think of is I can go get that at Netflix.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I can't get it anywhere else.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   A lot of their business, their whole business model is based on the ability to do that.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So, if Amazon didn't have every book or Netflix didn't have every movie, there'd be no long tail.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Yeah, I mean, it really came... It was coined by Chris Anderson at Wired Magazine.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And he did the first article and he's got a book coming out about the long tail, which I'm looking for.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   How to have a long tail?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   But it was literally Amazon was his first case and it said a physical bookstore has whatever the number is.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So many thousands of titles, period.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And if a book doesn't sell a certain number a month, you're out of there.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I know that.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And...
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   As do I.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But...
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   The other thing more depressing is there than seeing your book in the remainder bin.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   What I want to know is does every author go into the bookstore and look in the computer or on the structure of their own book?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Of course we do.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And I sign them, which is really lame because the bookstores have somebody who's defaced this book.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   They're right, Leo the Port in mind.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But the idea is that only something like Amazon can afford to service the long tail, if you will, to basically...
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   They can do it by having essentially zero inventory and supply the things that will sell one a year.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And that there is a whole economy.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And as Bill...
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Well, print-on demand will solve that really because then you don't even have to have a printed book.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   That's right.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   You print it when somebody orders it.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Probably some of those titles are print-on demand.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You have sort of two layers of it. Amazon doesn't even stock it and it's not even available in the...
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Those are the ones that will take a couple weeks to deliver.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Right.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   That's Lulu's model where they print everything on demand.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Nothing you buy a book in Lulu and it's good when you buy it.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Right.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And they have such fast printers that they can print instantly.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Well, and a lot of us, especially in the tech area, I think part of what makes podcasts so interesting is that a lot of us live in the long tail.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I mean, I don't even consider going half the time to the bookstore to buy the book that I was looking for because I know it's not going to be there.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I immediately just say, "Oh, I'm not going to find that. I just go to Amazon."
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   If I know what the name of the book is or if I know what the ISBN is that I want, I'm not going to even bother because I know that there's an 80% chance it's not going to be there.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So, I mean, we live in that area which I think is part of what helps fuel podcasting.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And a lot of the listening of the long tail because the information isn't...
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Podcasting really is all about the long tail. There's no fat head at the...
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Well, there are people who are trying to turn it into a star's and hit system as well.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   But they're playing the high end and look at Leo, you're in the fat head.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I was just...
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Is there no fat head here?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I have a fat head.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   I mean, if you look at iTunes and you look at the top 100, that's not the long tail.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   That's the fight podcast.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   But that's a problem is by normal standards, everything podcasting is onesies, twoies.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But it's going to have its own curve. It's a power law curve.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Well, and of course, the presence of Amazon and the creation of the long tail, it does change the demographics of the physical bookstore.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Because now there's less incentive for them to have any obscure books.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So it actually kills the long tail in brick and mortar.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Exactly.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   There's no more long tail.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   That's right.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Which could be a negative, I suppose.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I was just going to say, one of the things that I'm hoping that people...
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   that Apple sees from what Amazon's doing is the ability to really...
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   If you like this book, you might like this book. If you like this podcast, you might like this podcast.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   It is the cross-pollination that's really missing in iTunes.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   People who bought this also bought this.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Well, we're going to do that today, actually.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   That's one of the things we're going to do is cross-pollinate as many podcasts as we can by moving podcasters in and out.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   In fact, we'd like to thank you Digital Bill for joining us.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Absolutely.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Tell us where we can get Wizards of Technology.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's my pleasure and you can get it at WizardsOfTechnology.com.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   What do you do?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I mean, I know what you do.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   What do we do?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   We're basically geeks so that you don't have to be.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Our whole mission is to make technology simple for people.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   We look at the news and explain it in a way.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   The stories that we think affect people.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And we do the whole listener mail thing.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   People who have an issue or a problem with something.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   We try to solve it.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So we're doing call for help and we're doing...
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It's great. I know that.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   It's good all the time. It's great podcast.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Thank you. I appreciate that.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Thank you, Bill.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Why don't you stand up?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Darryl, why don't you get ready to come on in here and while we bring in another podcaster,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I want to ask, this is this week in tech.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   We should talk a little bit about this week's tech news.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And I think the big story is Sony caving.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Well, first of all, there's actually been a number of developments since last we talked about.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   The Sony root kit issue.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I have to say I was stunned in the USA Today yesterday.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   They finally mentioned it and they said Sony's CDs carry virus, which is completely wrong.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Because there is no self-reproducing behavior.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's a virus.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It's a security, potential security flaw, but it's not a virus.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Yeah, so basically they're lumping this problem into anything as bad as a virus.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Which of course, you know, those of us who are techy know that we have worms and viruses.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Well, what it underscored for me is that the general public has no idea.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I mean, all the tech community is up in arms about the root kit, but I think normal people don't even know.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Well, and it is a, I mean, a virus sounds a lot worse in many ways.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   How do you explain a root kit to USA Today audience?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Not going to happen.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   But imagine reading in USA Today that Sony discs have viruses on them.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I mean, that's a really bad thing.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Bad PR for Sony.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   So we knew that they phoned home last week.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   We found out that there was the first Trojan based on it.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Yes, there are actually now two.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   F-Secure has found a second variant of the first one.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Now we have two. The idea being that there's a backdoor Trojan that deliberately re-names itself
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   dollar-sciences, dollar-sci, drv.exe.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And there's now a second one.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   By doing so, it pretends to be one of the Sony installed files, which Sony's technology disappears from the system.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So the Trojan, I mean, a truly malicious backdoor Trojan is using the Sony technology to hide from scanners and traditional tools.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That didn't take long, did it?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   No, less than a week.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Hackers are getting so lazy.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   They didn't even bother writing their own root kit.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   They just used Sony's root kit.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Come on, guys.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   You don't have some pride in your work.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   So Sony's giving up.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So, well, then we heard, and this is unconfirmed two days ago, but I did see that the lame, the L-A-M-E-M-P3 copyright strings are in the code that Sony's installing, which is a breach of the Grand Hoffer copyright.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   So, also, and the GPL, because it's commercial software.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So they're stealing lame.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   They're stealing the lame MP3 technology and installing it in everyone's machine.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   How many people here hate Sony?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   No, no, no.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   I show a hands won't do.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   How many people here hate Sony?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Sony Baloney.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   So, is Sony giving up?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Are they going to do this stuff?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   The word in the newspaper today is that they've said, "Okay, we're removing all this technology from the CDs."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Now, "Sectree!"
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Yes!
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   We won!
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   The problem, of course, and the reason you and I are going to do this on Call for Health next week, is that it's still in all the CDs in the channel, in distribution on people's bookshelves.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I mean, so the problem is, like, permanently etched in history now.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And, of course, if end users don't know what a root kid is or that Sony's put one on there, they're certainly not going to go get service pack one and fix the problem.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   So, I mean, it's just basically a nightmare.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   No, but has the door been permanently opened for those projans?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Yes, right, forever.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   I mean, on any machine that runs one of these, now I know they're not going to do anymore, but one of these existing enhanced CDs.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   You can hide yourself for free.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And, you know, we don't know how many millions of machines it is, but it's presumably a large number.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I mean, it's really getting close to Sony needing to do a recall.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Now, the class action suit is on its way.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Yes, three, actually.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   There's the government of Italy is classifying this as breaking several of their laws.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   You don't mess with a pope.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   There's a firm.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I learned that in a couple of Twit kids to go.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   There's a firm in LA that is a major class action law suing firm, and they're suing also.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   The EFF is now examining this to see whether this qualifies for them to take some action.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   So, it's been a catastrophe and hopefully a good object lesson for the rest of the industry that's thinking,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   "Hey, we need to install DRM software, too."
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I think that's the best thing that could have happened, frankly.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   You can imagine that within the organization, there must have been some debate about this.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   So, somewhere there's at least one.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I don't think they're smart enough to have a debate over.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I really think a lot of them.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I mean, a lot of people just said, "Well, we're going to protect the CDs, but I don't think they got into how they were going to protect the CDs."
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   I think there was some handful of people that worked that out, but I think the people that said, "Yes, we're going to do it probably didn't think of it."
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   And this is a good wake-up call for the record industry to know that this causes a lot of damage.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   DRM good. Stealing bad.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Well, and you can imagine, too, it could have been worse.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Had this not come out and been discovered, other people would have done their own style of DRM.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And you'd have layers of this junk installing itself in the system.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   It's really destabilizing windows. I mean, it doesn't need any help being unstable.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I've got the Sony root kit. I've got the Warner's root kit. I've got the electric root kit. I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And there is a report that I have seen that we haven't tested that actually, there is an installer for OS X as well.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I mean, there is actually, there's an enhanced, it just came out yesterday.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   It's content enhanced.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   There's content enhanced installer for the OS X as well.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And some of the discs on a handful of discs, they don't know which one.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Now, Matt.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   That wasn't bad at this moment.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Yeah, PC users, you can stay away from my Mac.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Yeah, they have a huge deserve.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Wow. Well, the...
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So, there's an object lesson for record companies. There's also an object lesson for users.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   If you insert an audio CD or a DVD into your computer and it asks you to install something, don't do it.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Don't do it.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Yeah, because you do get the pop-up EULA, the end-user license agreement,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and if you decline, you won't get root-kitted.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Now, I wonder if there was ever discussion in the boardroom at Sony.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   We really have to pop this EULA.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I bet you anything they said that. Do we really have to tell them?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Do we're going to do this? We don't have to tell them that, do we?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   They bought the disc.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   There's a shrink-wrap license here. Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And Sony executives have specifically said, "There is no contact made by this software with Sony,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   but we know now it's confirmed that this stuff phones home.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Every disc that people play using this technology connects to Sony servers and reports what it is they're listening to.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Does it connect to Sony?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   So, it's a connector to the company that works for Sony.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I'll know that tomorrow because I bought one of these heinous things from Amazon,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and it's at home waiting for me to infect myself tomorrow.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Well, that's something to look forward to.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I want to introduce Daryl Shandro, who's sat down in the hot seat.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   We have a hot seat today.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And Daryl, it's great to have you. I met you earlier at the podcast Expo.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And you're blind, but not podcaster. Are you blind podcast listener?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Is that right?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I am a blind podcaster and podcaster listener.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Oh, you do a podcast. What's the podcast?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   It's called the Blind Access Journal, and I am an accessibility evangelist.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And it can be found at... Can I say where to find it?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Of course you can.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   We all plug. You might as well plug, too.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Blindaccessjournal.com.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Okay.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And one of the things Daryl wanted to come on is to talk a little bit about accessibility.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Now, podcasts are accessible for the most part, aren't they?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Correct. Yes. It's inherently accessible if you're using iPod or Lemon,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   which is now called the Juice Receiver.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   That's right. They had to drop the iPod or everybody's got the cease-to-desist order now.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Yeah. And that's just came out this morning. It's a JuiceReceiver.sourceForged.net.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   So if you're blind, you can use that as your pod-catching client to receive podcasts.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Unfortunately, iTunes is not yet accessible.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Yeah, iTunes is very bad, actually, at that.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Difficult to use because your screen reader won't handle it, or what's the...
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Right. What happens is there's a number of user interface elements
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   the way the program was designed. It's the way it's the attempts by screen readers to go ahead
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   and gain access to that software.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   There have been attempts in the past to ask Apple to fix it and no response to it.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I can see it. It's hard for me.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Yeah, I know. There's little letters.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   The whole interface is confused as that one.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   The computer industry basically doesn't consider anybody over 40 as existing.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   I mean, I can't read half the websites.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   I got a proposal for their web redesign, and these are young guys who are sending this to me.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Great company, archetype. But it's the font size must be eight point.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I can't read the dog thing. I'm thinking, "I hope they understand that you need to make some big fonts on the website
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   because if it looks like this, I'm not going to be able to read my own website."
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   So, you also were talking about captures and how much you hate captures, right?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Oh, captures are a killer right now because, you know, imagine that you would like to post a comment
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   to somebody's blog or podcast site, or you'd like to sign up for a podcast-related service on the web.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And you're going along through the sign up process, you know, enter a username, enter your email address,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   enter your password, confirm your password, someone and so forth.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   All of a sudden you come to type the characters you see in the picture.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Well, imagine what if you can't see the picture?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   You're stopped dead in your tracks right there.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   There's no sign up for you.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   I can't see the picture, and sometimes I can't figure out what those things are.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   It's like, wait, is this an H on steroids or is this a W?
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I find it helps to take acid right before you use this.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   It's clear as hell.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   No, so it's not.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   So, now I have seen some captures that have audible buttons.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   You know, you press listen to this capture.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Is that something?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   No kidding.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   That's great.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   I think that's a really good solution.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Very cool.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I am essentially, at this point, that is the state of the art in providing accessibility to captures.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   It doesn't mean everybody's needs, specifically somebody who is deafblind.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   So, I am asking industry to include the audio playback of the characters,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and go ahead and include a link to send somebody an email or call somebody and get some help.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Yeah, that's a great solution.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   So, if you can't do this, press this button or mail us an email.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   We'll help you get it.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Well, it shouldn't be and.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I need at least the audio playback.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   You don't want to waste time if you can do it.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Well, I would like to, unfortunately, say that Yahoo has such an alternative.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   You click a link and fill out a form and they promise to call you back,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   and about 90% of the time you never get a call back.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   It would work on that too.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Well, Darryl, I'm glad you came on.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   I know from doing radio for years that some of the most loyal radio fans are blind,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   and I know that that will be true for podcasting too.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   It's important for a podcaster to remember that.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I would also like to, I've been trying to get this done for a long time now.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   I'm a user of Blogger, Google's blogging service, and also a Gmail user.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I would, you know, please Google, fix your visual verification, add the audio link.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   We've been asking since February, and promises were made back in July on InternetNews.com
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   that this would be done in one to two months, and still not done,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   and there's no, the worst part that really kind of frustrates me is that there's nothing coming
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   from Google saying what actions they're in the process of taking to address the issue.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Thank you, Darryl. The podcast again is?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Blindaxisjournal.com.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   All right. Make sure you're so much.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Thank you, Darryl. Chuck Tamasi, why don't you come in here,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and you'll be next in our hot seat.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   While Chuck is getting us situated, I'll bring up another news story that I thought was very interesting.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   A deal between Yahoo and Tivo.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Did you see this story?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   No.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   What do you think of that, Doug?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   You know, I haven't deciphered it entirely, but I think anything that helps Tivo,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   I'm in favor of because I don't, I have two Tivo's that I bought the lifetime for,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   so I don't want to lose them.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I have to say, I think this makes Tivo the number one player out there,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   and I'm not in IPTV.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   So they already had the ability to program the thing remotely.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Yes.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   But now my understanding is, if I got it right, you can go to Yahoo's program listings
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and select a program that you want to record, and it will automatically program your Tivo to record it.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Do I get that right?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   That's right.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And the mainstream media is also focusing on this as turning a Tivo into kind of a web TV.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   So you'll have email, you'll have some internet capabilities, but I think that's missing the point.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Go ahead.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   What do you think, Alex?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I'm not sold.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I'm not sold.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   The problem is that I think that there are people who think that, you know,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   everyone wants to do the internet on their TV, and there are people who think that everyone wants to watch video on that.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   You're following the wrong trail here.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   The point of this is Yahoo becomes a television provider.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   In order for Yahoo to become a television provider, what do they need?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   They need something in the home that links up to Yahoo that allows you to record television programs,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   download television programs, and display them.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   What do they got?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   They got a Tivo box with an interface to Yahoo.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Now Yahoo can go along by television programming, offer it as IPTV.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   It is a key.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   So we're talking about a next generation Tivo that will have networking built in?
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   It's not really a next generation Tivo.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   It's a current generation Tivo.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   You've got ethernet, you've got a hard drive, you've got Linux, and now you have an interface to Yahoo.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Yeah, okay, right now you're clicking the Yahoo directory for existing television.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   For a firmware update.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   They can download TV.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Right now, a Tivo will download TV shows from the cable only, right, or from your television connection only.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   What if it could start downloading from the internet?
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   That's the ultimate.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   But forget about new content.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Think of what they've done to the value of their on-screen advertising because they can put up an advertisement for loss.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Click here to record on your Tivo.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Or when you're going through the broadcasting, say, "Oh look, there's Twit.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I know that's not a television broadcast, but I can download it and watch it."
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And then by the way, you have a little Domino's Pizza button pops up and says,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   "We would like to order a pizza while you're watching Twit today?"
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   You ordered pepperoni last time. Can we do that again for you?
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I think this is a major development.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   And I think people are underestimating what this means.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   It's very good for Tivo.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   It's very good for Yahoo.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   And I think it is a major blow for IPTV.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   But maybe I'm the only one who does because I don't see a lot of nods.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   I guess I look at it like I think that Tivo is, I mean, I don't know, what is the penetration of Tivo right now?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Well, it's not that big, but all of a sudden they might be...
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Well, financially, Tivo has been in trouble all along.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I think it's 2% of the general television audience.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   But it's in the... I think it's in the... I want to say 8 to 10.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Is that...
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   That'd be 10 million maybe, but the 2% is pretty small.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   That's one in 50 TVs.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Although that's not a verb.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   It's not a verb.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   But it's a... I guess for me, and I think a lot of people who use Tivo, you know, that's a bigger thing.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I think probably one of my problems is that I don't...
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Why do Tivo have a lot of people here?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   But Tivo now has a compelling way to sell Tivo's too.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I mean, this is... It's not based on the current install base.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   It's based on making Tivo even more desirable.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I guess I...
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Tivo with Yahoo TV.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   What's wrong with that?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I guess, you know, my issue is, is that I think it's on the other side.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   My issue is that...
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   That with... When we're looking at this, I'm looking at the installed base of the number of PCs and Macs and everything else.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And the fact that I don't really feel like I need a TV to do anything.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I mean, I plug my iPod into a T...
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   It's a good point. You don't.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   But the general mass... Let's get back to that long tail.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I still do.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   The long tail, which sure like this. Don't you think?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I mean, you're an advanced techy.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   But I would say Tivo in a lot of ways is still the long tail.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I mean, you know, the thing is...
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   It's easier than putting it on your device.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   But you can't get real TV without being a pirate, right?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Right now.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   IPTV requires you to break the law if you want the shows that are being broadcast.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Unless it's Desperate Housewives are lost.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Okay. All right.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   But as that starts to pick up, the big question is...
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I mean, if... And this puts... Maybe it puts Apple versus Yahoo.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   But I mean, the thing is, is that the iTunes model is, is that I don't need to...
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   You know, I don't need it at all. I can sit there and just click it.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And I am so happy. I have to say.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   I have... I've now had the video iPod for a couple of weeks.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   I don't need it to... I mean, I sit there and I walk to work and I watch my little thing.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   I don't need that.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Most people that are going to want to sit in the living room, watch their television,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   and if the fact that they have a set-top box that is a computer,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   but they don't know it's a computer that connects to Internet television from all over the world,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   I think that's a big deal.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   If the pizza is bigger than the screen, that's a problem.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   We'll make sure the pizza's small.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Chuck Tomasi is here. He is a podcaster with his own podcast, Chuck Chat.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   But also a member of Friends in Technology.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   And I wanted you to...
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Folks, I'm welcome to Twit.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Thank you. Welcome. Thank you.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   You had me on your show sometime ago and I'm glad to reciprocate.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Well, I appreciate it.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Tell me about Friends in Technology.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Friends in Technology is a oxymoron, actually.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   It's a tight-knit group of...
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Loosen it, Friends.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   There's no commitment other than to have fun.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   That's the primary objective.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And it is mostly podcasters, so yes.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Yes.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   How many different podcasts?
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Six.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Six.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And tell me what the names are.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   I have to look them up.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   We're good friends.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   You got to go.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Friends, but loose.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   And they're all here, by the way, and they're fit t-shirts.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   We're missing one.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Oh, all right.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   We're missing one.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   He couldn't make it to the X-ball.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Okay.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   We've got, behind me Kevin Devon from In the Trenches.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Love it.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And his co-host George Starcher is back in the...
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Hey George.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   ...wrong somewhere.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Yep.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Further back in a trench.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   We've got myself, Chachat.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Chachat.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   We do Technorama.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Craig Step is my co-host.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   We've got Victor Cajiao from the Typical PC User Podcast.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I like that because Victor's really aimed at the beginners and newbies and really helps them out.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Yes, they're a really great thing.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   They won't listen to Twip, but they can listen to you.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   We've got Douglas E. Welch from Career Opportunities, the High-Tech Career Handbook.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Excellent advice for those in the high-tech area.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Mike Tekshaw, Mike Smith was not able to make it.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And Steve Holden, who is the extremely tall gentleman in the back from Tech News Radio.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   There are a lot of little loosely affiliated groups like this.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Yes.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   I was talking to a 14-year-old kid who probably, I think he had to go home to his homework.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   But he has the teen podcasters in that work.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   And there's something like 40 or 50 teen podcasts.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I'm 70 teen podcasters.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   And I think it's...
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   The fact that the product's presentation will take place on the stage.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   My flight's leaving. I better go.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I don't think so. I didn't know we were doing this in the airport.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   I just think that this is one way the podcasters...
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   What is the benefit of getting together in a group like that?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Our objective is just to have fun.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   We found that we were...
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   You don't think...
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   ...being across marketing?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Yes. It's across promoting.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   We've got projects that are bigger than the sum of the parts.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   We did a server room of horrors.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   A Halloween special.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Horror.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I know you're talking about soccer girl.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   We'll be back later.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   We're working on a Christmas special.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   We've got a weekly look back at all of the shows that we do.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   The six of us.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   We splice them together, make a 15-minute promo.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   We call it retrofit.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Look back at the week.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   And just small projects along the way.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Fit tips.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   It's come across something that's along the group.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Adam Curry is apparently some sort of feud going on.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   I'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Chuck, thank you for being here.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   We appreciate it.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   All the best with fit and all the best with Chuck Chat.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I'm going to let you get up.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Don Katz is here from audible.com.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   We're going to talk to them a little bit about their plans for
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   podcasting and audible.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   I just wanted to mention that it was in-wired.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   I don't know how real it was.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   But apparently there was a little feud going on between the organizer of this
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   show, Tim Borkin and Adam Curry, the pod father.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Do you know anything about that, Doug?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   You can stay well away from this one.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   I may have to recuse myself being a pretty good friend of both of them.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   But let's put it this way.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Politics has made its way into podcasting.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   It's kind of unfortunate.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Didn't take long.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   No.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Well, and that's the problem.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Adam's got this pod show, which is a business.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And the model, although it's not completely obvious, seems to be
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   network of podcasts that will sell advertising as a network,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   support each other in creating new podcasts.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   So, I think it's a really good thing.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   I mean, the important thing there is that they've got funding from not
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   just any venture capitalist, but from Kleiner Perkins.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Not bad.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And Ray Lane and John Dor are actually on their board.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   So they have a plan?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   They have a real plan.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And I don't know what that plan is.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Well, that's the irony.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Obviously Ray and John do, but they haven't shared it with anybody else.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   My theory is that this is much bigger than any of us think, which is my
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   vision is they're going to be the next NBC.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   And that's why it scares the hell out of me.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I'm not sure I really want NBC or anything like it to be involved with.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Well, the challenge there is, you know, are they a fathead company?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Are they a long tail company?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Are they both?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I can see the advantage though, because if there is an NBC like thing,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   it's going to bring in people to, I mean, new listeners that we're not
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   going to be able to get otherwise.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And so people who are not affiliated with NBC, you know, all of the little
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   guys, you know, there's as much bet, you know, basically it broadens the
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   audience of listeners tremendously if something like that happens.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Well, but it's also divisive because that what Adam did was he set up
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   across the street, a little mini expo.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   And I mean, he did show up last night for the awards ceremony and he was
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   very gracious.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   But I have to wonder if we need that kind of divisiveness in this
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   baby community, this infant community.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Well, you know, money ruins everything.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Cindy Lauper.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Right.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   So I think it's inevitable.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   We could have seen it.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   You couldn't have said exactly where things have come from, but there are
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   competing interests.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   And I think we know that's going to be happening.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Hey, speaking of interests, I'm a big fan of Books on Tape.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   One of the things I do all the time is listen to Books on Tape.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   And for a long time, I rented them, like a set.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And then I longed and about 1997 comes a company called Audible.com,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   where you can download these things from the Internet.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And it's changed my life.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I love Audible.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   I've been an Audible member for years.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And Don Katz is here.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   He's the CEO, founder of Audible.com.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   It's great to have you, Don.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Good to have you.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Good to be here.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   What brings you to the podcast?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   They have you here.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Yes.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Good to have us here having you here.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   What brings you to podcast Expo?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   So Audible decided to open up our platform and try to be as helpful as
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   we could to podcasters by taking this 10 years of innovation, figuring
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   out what it takes in terms of the user experience of what the file
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   formats need to do to have a good experience when you're driving along
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   listening to your audio, as well as some of the other bells and whistles,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   which allow you to build businesses, build a rate card, have
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   verifiable measurement of who's listening, which as this industry
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   evolves, it could ever more important.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   You guys have credit for devising the first portable media player.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Before that was an I-plus.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   I give a talk here admitting how early we really were.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   But it was four years before the iPod came out.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   We were commercializing and we had a wonderful audio player that held
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   two hours of audio.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   It sounded as bad as audio.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Could it sound like an answering machine that has bad things done to it?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   But we still have people who think of that as the audible sound.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Oh, no, it sounds bad.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   You're essentially MP3 with digital rights management built into it, right?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   I mean, the type four is--
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   The type four is--
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   The type four is--
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   The type four is--
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   The type four is--
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   The type four is--
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   The type four is--
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   The type four is--
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   It's optimized, but we also have two other codecs that the consumer can choose that are--
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   You have up to four different codecs that you can choose.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Yeah, they know two, three, and four.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Basically, you can pick your quality level and some people are still up on dial up, so
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   it matters to optimize it or they have devices that don't have much memory.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   I use type four on all of the things and it's about a 32 kilobit MP3, but the quality is better
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   because you're optimizing for voice and so forth.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   That's right.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And it tends--
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   We don't get any complaints.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   It seems to do the trick.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Although, I have to say, in Germany in our operation, they must have different ears because
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   they're actually our consumer complaints about the level of quality.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   From where it came from, they know they're--
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   That's sad.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   I have a question, Don.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Is it true that you have perhaps the only independent Apple compatible codec for DRM
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   in terms of DRM that you can generate files for the iPod with their DRM that nobody else can
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   do?
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Is that right?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   The iPod is fully compatible with Auto.com and our subscription service and our RS delivered
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   content.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   That's how I use it.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And so you can also go to--
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   So basically, commercially, the iPod will go to iTunes where the provider of their spoken word
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   programming or it'll come to audible.com where you can get more of a subscription service
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   version of what you get at iTunes.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   They're also the only company that allows-- that can use iTunes with non-Apple players.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   I use my iTunes to move stuff to my palm, which I don't know how you got Apple to like.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   You can do that, but it works great and it's a really nice solution.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   I would have thought that you would be threatened, frankly, by podcasting.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   You know, one of the reasons I think podcasting is so successful is it's an niche that's not
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   very competitive.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   All podcasts are competing against is the radio.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   You know, maybe the cell phone and driving, paying attention to what you're doing.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Or books on tape, Audible Books.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And, I mean, did you not initially see this as a threat to you?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Now, actually, the original business plan, unrequited to some extent, had a world of produced
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   programming that was audio content.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   It was audio content.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   They're free.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   It was just anything.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And it was always sort of part of the dream to have this layer of productivity and we would
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   be able to kind of bring people up into a paid universe or help them.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   But you wouldn't require them to be paid.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   You could offer free content.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Right.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   I was always thought to be it would be a world of free stuff just because with the ubiquity
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   of usage and devices and people programming their own listening time, we would just do
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   better.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   So we all have been waiting for it, basically.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   And I think I want to embrace it.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   And the tools are a first step.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   But I'd like to see an environment where people can, in the realm of creating multiplicity
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   of revenue streams, use what Audible is as a premium service, as yet another channel for
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   the best stuff.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   And we're already seeing interesting hybrids where the American public media, you know,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   the old Minnesota public radio, their podcasts talk about and drive people to the full downloads
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   at Audible.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And we see huge spikes in their revenue because of their downloads because the podcasts are
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   making people, you know, they have value in and of themselves but they're driving people
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   to another layer which is premium.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   And with your stuff, Doug, there's no question.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   You know, you could conceivably branch out into the kinds of things that Jupiter and other
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   people are, you know, getting a lot of money for if you chose to.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   And then use the free channel for other things.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Now, there's also something new this week for podcasters.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Is that right?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Yeah, so Audible wordcast is this week.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Is this application where we'll host for you.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   You want to set up commercial services.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   We'll set it up for payment systems.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   You want to be able to build a rate card because you know exactly how many people are downloading
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   and listening.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   You want to qualify people.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   And actually, as a creator, you can actually, through a registration, find out where people
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   are, what they've actually listened to.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   There's a long form work better than short form.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   It's a pretty extensible tool that I think people will enjoy using.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And plus, it allows this variable risk structure which at some point the industry is just
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   going to need.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   I mean, at some point, you know, some of the things, the way it works now, if you have
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   millions of listeners and you're not prepared for that, the characteristics of the cost
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   can drive you out of business real quick.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   We were working with a magazine that we're about to do some podcasts with, some video podcasts.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   And they were like, "Okay, we're all ready to go."
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And I said, "Okay, so just so you know, we're talking about two to ten terabytes a week.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   We just want to make sure you're kind of in the ballpark."
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   And they were like, "We'll get back to you."
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   So, yeah, it's -- but the other thing is, is that it's starting to become less expensive to do as well.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   >> Fan with is getting cheaper.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   >> Yeah, now, how do you see the monetization of the revenue generation?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   How do you see that really entering the podcast arena from your point of view?
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   >> I'm guessing it's mostly ad supported for most people at first just because, you know,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   we found that, you know, we are introducing original programming all the time and because
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   we've built up the trust with hundreds of thousands of buyers of content, we can
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   consistently expose and degrade stuff.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Often we'll make it free at first and they'll get habituated to it.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   But it's not as easy, I think, to that as with podcasting to just have an audience that's growing
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   and have people, even if it's local, wanting to create advertising there.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   I'm guessing that that's the primary bill.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   >> When you're talking about advertising, is it something where someone's giving you a slot
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   and you're putting the advertising in or is it something that they're doing their own advertising?
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   >> In the case of Wordcast right now, it's really just a tool that allows for ad insertion elements.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   You get the ads and you build the business, we're just giving you the tool.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   >> What about a podcast like ours or maybe even like IT conversations that doesn't ever
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   want to put ads in it, but would like maybe to set up a subscriber system or something
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   like that, is that going to also be positive?
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   >> Yeah, well this tool, if you wanted to just basically start charging, it's ready for commerce.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   >> Do I have to put a DRM in it?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   >> You do have to use DRM.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   But DRM in our world, our world of users don't know anything about DRM.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   >> Well I have to authorize my device and authorize iTunes to use Autobi, I enter in the password.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   And you do have some limits, do you have a number of limits on number of machines you have?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   >> Yeah, it's basically a couple of computers, a couple of devices within different classes
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   and it's usage for a large family or teachers are using it in classrooms.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   >> It's a pretty big number.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   >> It's a pretty big number.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   >> It's a pretty big number.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   >> And you allow burning?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   >> We allow burning.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   >> Do you limit the number of burns?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   >> Yeah, theoretically it's 1.5 burns, so it allows for bad media, you know, every so often.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   >> I've got a whole bunch of disks that are half burned.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   >> Half burned?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   >> Half broke.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   >> Maybe.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   >> But you know what we do have a story in.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   >> We do what we have to do to make the traditional content community feel comfortable.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   >> We're in a funny position because I would like both to charge for it and not have DRM
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   and maybe to give it away.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   >> Don't forget one of the things with Audible's format is that one of the issues with most
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   DRMs is it plays on a very narrow band of devices.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   >> And we're really playing between the iPod and the POMs and most of the Microsoft-based
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   MP3 players, it's pretty much the market share at this point.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   So you're not really losing anything by using our format.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   >> I think our format is on more devices than anything but MP3 and MP3 isn't really commerce
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   ready in its native state.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   >> Well, we're just thrilled to have the support of Audible in the podcast community because
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   you're right, you've been doing it longer than anybody, you know more about it than anybody else.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   >> And for me it's about the unleashing and more creativity.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   I think that the next great creators are out there and starting to make this on their own.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   And the professional intermediaries do serve a really important purpose for the culture
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   and the industries they create, but God knows they're not, you know, to be all in end though.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   >> Well, and for knitting.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   >> And for knitting.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Somebody's got a support knitting.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   >> Nick Cast.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Thank you Don.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   We really appreciate it.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Don Cat, CEO, founder of Audible at Audible.com, and as a longtime subscriber to their books on tape,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   I have to agree that the DRM is not onerous, but I think it's more philosophical than anything
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   else for me.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   It's just I don't want to have DRM.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   >> And now that that's in his business model, he can't ever back away from it.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   >> He's stuck with it.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   >> Yes.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   >> He's stuck with it.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   >> As would Apple be.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   >> Right.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   >> In my speech this morning, you weren't there all bit.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   >> I was a little busy.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   >> Doing a radio show.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   >> I -- >> I would have been otherwise.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   >> I've got some issues with DRM and some other things.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Just fundamentally.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   And it came to me through an interview that one of our hosts did with make horror head,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   the blogger.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   When we talked about what it means to put content behind any kind of restriction whatsoever.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   This is something that's the choice of the creator, of course.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   When you make content hard to get to it anyway, you devalue the content.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   >> I agree.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   >> That's because you can't link to it anymore.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   You're not going to link to content that's only available through Audible.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   You're not going to link to something that requires registration.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Therefore, it's taken out of the conversation.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   You can't excerpt it.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   You can't do all these things.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   You've essentially ripped the value out of that content.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   >> One of the things that -- I mean, as you look at it from the software side of things,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   there's been a lot of -- there's a lot of different ways people do that protect their
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   software.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   They'll be protected in a certain way.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   And really, the reason that Photoshop is where it's at is because they shift it with every
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   scanner known to man.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   >> They gave it away.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   >> They gave it away.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   You know, and the -- I mean, they made some money on it as they moved through it.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   But it was essentially free for me when I bought my scanner.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   But the thing is, what's interesting is the companies who predictably were the best at
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   protecting their software.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   And there are some companies that it was almost never a good crack of that software.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Or gone.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   It was the ones that were actually fairly easy to pirate are the biggest.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   >> Isn't that interesting?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   >> They have the largest installed base.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   I mean, there were companies that were really --
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   >> Steelless, low.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   >> There were companies that were -- that would brag to me how they were -- they were, you
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   know, you know, electric image was a good example of 3D package that I used to use a long
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   time ago.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   >> You were a big pusher of it under the garage.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   >> Oh, big fan of it.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   >> You sold a lot of copies of it.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   >> And I was always a big proponent that one of the reasons that they had a hard time getting
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   into -- it was an incredibly great 3D app or still is.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   But they have -- they've had a hard time going where something like Maya or 3D studio is gone
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   in a lot of ways.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   And I believe part of it is because -- specifically because they were so good at protecting the
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   code.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   You know, Maya, you know, it's very, very easy, you know, to move that along.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And they know that eventually you're going to end up in a place where you're making money
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   or you're in a big company and you're going to have to buy it.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   You know, and a lot of people -- a lot of companies will not -- they won't say that in
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   public.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   But they'll be kind of like, you know, it's -- you know, that's what's going to happen.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   >> Ironically, Photoshop and CS2 has now put a very onerous copy protection system in.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   They've got -- you've got to do the thing that you do with windows.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   You've got to phone home and get it authorized.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   What do you think?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   >> Well, there's a bad move on their part.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   >> Well, the stuff that we've been talking about with, you know, Sony, you know, Toby's
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   been doing for about five years.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   >> Well, that's -- by the way, that's a good point.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Every time you run Photoshop, even the older versions, it would phone home.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   >> Right.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   >> And you can take it out.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   >> Now, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't prosecute anybody.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   They never pursued anybody.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   But it just gave them statistics about how many pirated software.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   >> Yeah, they just wanted to know what was going on.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   So they've never actually done anything with it.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   But it was there, and people noticed it, and you could take it out.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   I mean, you went in --
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   >> That's when I did those downloading a files.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   >> Yeah, it was --
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   >> Right.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   >> No information has been transferred.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   >> Right.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   >> Yeah, right.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   >> Just your IP.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   >> That's who you are.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   >> And the fact that you exist.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   >> Well, that's really, I think, what they were looking at.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   >> Well, is this a registered copy?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   No.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Or does this one serial number?
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   How many copies are registered this serial number?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   >> That's exactly.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   >> That's exactly.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   >> But the thing is, is that as they start to tighten that up, the real question is going
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   to be when they start tightening up and does that start to open a window?
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Because right now Photoshop is ubiquitous.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   I mean, when I talk about Photoshop on tech TV, I assume that everybody who's serious
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   about doing photos is going to have it because they can either buy it or they can find it.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   And so I just make the assumption that that's there.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   If I can no longer make that assumption, do I start showing GIMP on tech --
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   >> Something free.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   >> Do I show something free?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   >> Something free.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   >> Something easier or aperture or whatever it is.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   I mean, other things start to open up as they start to tighten it up.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   >> So Doug, you think we should always give away Twit without DRM and should always be
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   free?
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   >> I'm saying if you want your content to have the highest possible value in the
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   universe, you give it away.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   >> But that may not be what you're optimizing for.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   >> Well, I think in this, what about this model?
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   We always give away the audio for free.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   And then there's other versions, like a video version.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   >> Well, in fact, we do a new thing on IT conversations where if you want it fast, we'll sell it
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   to you.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   >> So if we do a conference, we might deliver all of the audio from a conference for $100
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   a week or two after the event.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Or it's going to come out for free one program a week over the next six months.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   >> You're doing that with this conference?
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   >> No.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   >> Something like that?
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   >> No.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   >> This one's going to be all free.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   >> Really?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   >> He's not charging for -- are you going to -- but you're not going to offer it all at once.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   You'll still read the weekly download.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   >> That's right.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   >> Okay.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   >> So if you do -- and there were some very good sessions at the podcast expo.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   If you want to get those, they will be available at IT conversations.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   >> They will be on IT conversations over the next six months.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   >> But we did -- it's been an experiment.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   We did accelerating change 2005, 24.99 for all 25 sessions.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Poptech, which was a major conference a couple of weeks ago.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   We rolled that out for $100 for all of them.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Or you can wait and get them one a week.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   >> And how are -- I mean, not exact numbers, but were the numbers reasonable?
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Were there a lot of people that reacted to that?
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Or was it a handful?
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   >> I can tell you.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   It's very low.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   I mean, it's an experiment for us.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   The only one we have numbers on is accelerating change.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   We got less than 100 purchases.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   But we didn't promote it very hard.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   In fact, we tried to downplay it because we weren't quite ready technologically with the
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   payment mechanism.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   So it's just happening.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Again, we're learning.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   >> I think it's a good model, though.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   I mean, it sounds very reasonable to me.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   People will pay a little bit for value at it.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   >> Well, that's why I think the New York Times is it backwards.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   They're charging for their archives.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   >> That's interesting, isn't it?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   >> Newspapers tend to charge for the archives.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   Today's stuff is free.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   >> So you think they should charge for today's stuff because it's more valuable?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   >> On that basis, they should be able to give me the newspaper for free.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   >> Right.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   >> Deliver the Times to be for free.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   >> And if you want an old newspaper, it'll cost you.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   >> Yeah, there you go.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   >> Yeah, they've got it backwards, don't they?
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   There must be some thinking behind that.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   >> No, it's -- there must be a reason they do it, though.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   I mean, you think of the Times as being sort of the paper of record for the nation, and
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   it's not any longer.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   It's the paper of record for your --
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   >> Consider it for this last two days.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   >> Your experience is that a link will go buzzing around the net with an article in the newspaper.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Well, you want to read it because it's Newsy right now.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   >> That's when it has value.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   >> If you're hit with a -- with like a forum saying, oh, no, you've got to log in and this
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   is the premium content.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   It's like, okay, I'll go find somewhere else.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   >> Forget it.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   I'll get the Reuters.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   >> So perhaps their logic is if they do let people get in on the new stuff.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   >> I think that's it.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   They get the promotional value.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   >> Then they get connected and it's like, oh, okay, you know, maybe this is a good thing.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   >> I have bought a few articles, but rarely will I buy an older article.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   I guess they don't see it really as a revenue stream.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   >> Don't people send you links, you know, there was an article about someone at the
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Times.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Here's a link, read it.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   You just go to the page that says, it's free, but just registrars.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Oh, God, I just can't be bothered.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   >> Bug me not.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   >> Bug me not, baby.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Speaking of Bug me not, Joseph Klein is here.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   >> A little biblical.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   I prefer Joe.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   >> Joe.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Joseph.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Joe.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   He's an interesting business model.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   He does voice work for podcasts.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   >> Tell me about that.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   >> I'm like you, Leo.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   I'm an old radio hound dog from the old school.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   >> Listen to him.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Give him the good mic.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   >> I'm jealous.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   I'm sitting here.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   >> Come here.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Sit over.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   This is the hile that I won.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   >> Play interstitial music now.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   >> Oh, I started doing Christmas.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   >> Give the man with the pipes, the microphone.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   >> Hello.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   >> Isn't that nice?
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   >> Oh my gosh.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   >> He sounds just like you.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   >> I was jealous.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   I was sitting behind you.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   He was so jealous.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   >> He sat me down and gave me that little thing.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   >> He's a great mic.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   >> Adam Curry has one.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   >> That's right.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   >> We'll see if he sounds better.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   >> I use a road microphone.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   The road NTK.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   It's a great tube mic made by an -- it's a tube they call it a valve now.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   It's a tube mic.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   >> Valve.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   >> Wow.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   >> It's a valve microphone.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   It's being made by an Australian company called road.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   I'm sure a lot of podcasters out there are familiar with this.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   >> Do people pay you money to do voice work for them?
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   >> Not anywhere near enough.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   >> No.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   >> They do.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   >> Give me an example of the kind of thing you would do.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   >> Welcome to this week in tech.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   >> There you go.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   You can use that.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   >> We were talking about this earlier.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   The guy who does -- you've got mail for America online.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Elwood Edwards does -- for ten bucks.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   I just bought it.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   I don't have it with me.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   You can drop it in.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   >> Here, I'll give you a better one.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   >> You've got mail.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   >> I had him record.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   >> You've got mail.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   >> You've got mail.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   >> You twitted.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   >> Anyway, our company, we started a new company.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   I'm an old radio hound dog, as I said.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Back in the '70s and '80s, I was the leading producer of commercials for record albums.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   >> I'm sure it did.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   >> I sure did.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   I won three or four -- three cleo awards and four international broadcasting awards.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Doing all that stuff.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   It was lots of fun.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   >> Summer is.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   >> We used Ernie Anderson on all those.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   >> Right.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   >> We passed away.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   >> The later he had.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   >> His son is called Thomas Anderson.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   >> As a matter of fact, next to ABC.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   >> I did more spots with Ernie for Casablanca.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   >> He was there house in the house.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   >> He was an amazing -- >> Any other production company.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   >> People probably don't know his name.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   Those of us in the business do.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   But they know his voice.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   >> Do you know who his son is?
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Paul Thomas Anderson?
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   >> That's what I just said.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   >> He's a pretty -- >> He's also the one who did the visa.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   It's everywhere you want to be.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   He did awesomely great.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   >> Lots of stuff.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   He was great.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   But I left that business.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   I got tired of it.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I dropped out of school.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   I got tired of it after doing 1200 commercials.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   I got tired of it.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   I was kind of an old school dropout until recently.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Late last year I discovered podcast.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   >> What does an old radio guy think of this new medium?
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   >> Absolutely fantastic.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   It woke me up.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   It sent me back to school.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   >> See, those of us who love audio.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   I know you're that way too, Doug.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Are excited about this.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   It's a renaissance of a medium that has really been
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   kind of left by the way.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   >> That's great.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   >> I'm hoping there are all these young people who are going to
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   start doing audio.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   >> I'm back in the bedroom studio with my computer.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   >> I don't know if I want to know that.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   >> Actually, you know, my house works in the bedroom.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   But my computer does more than a million-dollar recording
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   studio that I use at home.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   So what happened was I went back to school and I learned
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   digital audio.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   This was a few years ago.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   I was getting interested and excited about that.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Then this podcasting thing came along and I said to myself,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   "Well, you know, there's a need for some good voice work out
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   there."
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   And people are amateurs.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   They are doing their podcasts and their amateurs and they're
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   not too structured.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Nothing wrong with having a kind of a very professional voice
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   intro, very professional promo.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   >> It can make a big difference.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   >> So we started a company.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   I have a partner named Bill Fortune who is a voice guy and a
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   former news anchor person out of Chicago, Illinois, nationally
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   known just jockey and voice guy.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   And we formed the podcast voice guy.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   >> How much is this going to cost?
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   >> How much you got?
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   You know, that's a tough one.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   >> You pay by the word.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   >> You pay by the minute.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   >> You know, people are asking me that all the time.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   We're going to probably start with rates as low as $75.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   But if you need three or four pages read, of course it's going
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   to be higher than that.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   >> How do people -- where do people go?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   >> www.podcastvoiceguys.com.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   And our website is under construction.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   It will be up and running next week.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   >> Better hurry.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   >> Be patient.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   >> A few tweets might be visited.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   >> Looks like I'm going to probably need a completely different
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   server than the one I've signed up.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   >> Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   >> Oh, well, please don't go there yet.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   >> Joe, thanks for coming by.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   It's really interesting to see there are a number of models for
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   how this can work.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   The keynote address from Jason Caliconis who was the guy who
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   made $25 million selling web logs, Inc.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   To AOL was a series of business plans that won't work for
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   podcasting.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Did you see that?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   >> What do you think?
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   >> Well, I like the contrast between Jason's presentation and
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   yours.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   That was the best of all of them.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   >> We're going to swap seats right now.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   >> To give up this might.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   >> You have to give it up.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Sorry.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   >> Darn it.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   >> I have to give this one.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   >> Tell us.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   >> As much as -- you know, Jason is probably well-known,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   as the aggressive guy in our community.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   The guy who's --
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   >> He puts the money.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   >> He puts it out there and he does it.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   You sort of love him and you hate him all at once.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   >> His company Web Logs Inc started in gadget.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   That was the big -- that was, I think, what made him the most
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   when he was in gadget.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   But there were a number of other blogs associated with it.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   >> I think it's still the big one probably.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Although his auto blog is really popular, too.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   But what I liked about Jason's presentation was he didn't hold
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   back and he said some very --
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   >> Unpopular things.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   >> Yeah, but they were true.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   He's willing to say he points out, you know, you're not going
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   to make money doing this and you're not going to make money
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   doing that.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Get used to it.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   >> He's got 25 million.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   He can be unpopular.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   >> I kind of said the same thing, but in a little bit
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   different way, I don't think people should be worried about
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   making money.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   >> Well, I think he was saying this won't make money and
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   you're saying that's fine.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   This is what I want to do.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   >> Right.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   >> That's why you do it.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   >> For Twit.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   You know, we're not bringing in sponsors and we're proud of it.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   >> Right.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   >> How are we going to be able to listen to your keynote?
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   >> I think we're going to podcast.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   I have to ask Tim Berkman.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   He said they are recorded it and I think I'm going to be able to
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   put it up on the net.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Do you guys have it?
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   >> I will have it.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   >> We should do.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   >> Taylor has the video.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   >> Taylor went to a lot of the sessions.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   I respect him.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   A lot of organizers said no, you can't have independent
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   video and audio recording.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   I want to do something with these tapes.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   >> He gets it.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   >> Tim definitely gets it.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   >> Right.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   >> I think you're going to offer it.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   >> We'll have it.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   >> Well, we can do it.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   >> I have complete control over the sequence and releases.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   >> We don't have to do it.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   >> I will link to you.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   I will be glad to link to you.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   >> We'll work that out.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   I'll put it in the radio.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   >> Radio Leo feed contains everything that I do.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   It's sometimes often cross links to other podcasts.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   >> I'm going to do it.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   >> I'm going to do it.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   I'll do it.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   >> We'll talk about that.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   You just live down the road.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   >> Cool.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   >> Another interesting idea for podcasting.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Pod caching.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Have you ever heard of geocaching?
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   >> Geocaching.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   >> I love geocaching.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   You seem like you be a geocacher.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   >> My main tech support guy is like a fanatic.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   Wherever he is, he's called me on the phone and says, okay, put
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   in this code.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   I'm his interactive web guy on call.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   It's like, Greg, where the hell are you?
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   >> Tell us, in your word, Steve, what is geocaching?
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   >> It's a bizarre, serious community of people who, well, from my
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   standpoint, in my words, who hide random little boxes of things
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   like behind telephone polls and literally under rocks.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   And then they give the GPS coordinates and make puzzles out
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   of them.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   It's just sort of a strange outdoor hobby.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   >> Well, Sonny Portacio is here.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   He is from geocaching.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   I'm sorry, pod caching.com.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   >> Pod cache.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   >> Pod cache.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Kind of an unusual twist on this whole.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Hey, Sonny, welcome.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   My name is Sonny.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   My wife, Sandy and I have done a home grown podcast all about
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   geocaching.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   >> So you were geocachers before?
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   We're avid geocachers.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   >> I think it sounds really cool.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   It's a way to use a GPS device.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   You have a GPS device.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   It's a way to use it.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   You get outside.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Is it the settings where these things are hidden isn't always
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   urban?
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   Sometimes it's in the country.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   >> Oh, you know, it can be anywhere.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Actually, you're probably driving past geocaches all the time.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   They're out under bushes.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   They could be hidden in urban settings.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   >> You just walked on one.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   >> You didn't know it.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   >> Actually, there's one about 200 feet away outside the park.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   >> Is there really?
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   >> Oh, they're everywhere.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   There's 200,000 all over the world.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   >> Oh, so these don't disappear?
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   It's not like a treasure hunt where someone finds a treasure and
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   takes it away.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   >> No, the idea is anybody can hide one and then you post
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   the coordinates to a website and then once the coordinates are
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   posted, anybody can do a search.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   If you went to the website and did a search by your zip code,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   you'd find there hundreds around your home.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   So really, what our website is, our podcast is covering all
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   the things about geocaching.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   >> So is there any overlap between geocaching and flash mobs?
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   >> Flash mobs?
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   >> Flash mobs?
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   >> Oh, flash mobs is, you know, all of a sudden, you know,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   5,000 people show up at the same time in the same place because
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   they got it on an SMS.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   >> Oh, no.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   >> Oh, there's got to be--
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   >> What is-- what is--
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   >> What is-- what is--
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   >> Well, pod caching.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Our site, basically, we cover news, tips and tricks, tools of
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   the trade, and so we're-- we're avid geocachers and we--
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   >> Oh, so it's-- so it's--
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   >> Podcasting for the geocaching audience.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   We cover it for newbies and introduce people to the sport or
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   hobby, and we also do it for the veterans, too.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   We give them tips and tricks, but the--
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   >> But there's a twist.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   >> There is a twist.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   >> Go ahead, tell them.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   >> The one interesting thing that we've done and more people are
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   starting to do it is instead of hiding the pod caches and
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   having people find it using a GPS receiver, we're giving audio
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   clues.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   So now what people are doing is downloading our files and
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   then getting audio clues on how to find these secret hidden
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   caches.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   And the reason the caches don't disappear is because the rule is
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   once you find a cache, you're supposed to open it up, sign the
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   logbook, put it back in there, and then put it back so other
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   people can find it.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   >> That's a kind of nice twist that makes it--
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   really makes it work, because if they disappear, then it's no fun
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   at all.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   But this way, you look at the logbook and you see all the people
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   who found it.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   >> Exactly.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   >> And sometimes you put new stuff in.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   >> Well, yeah, the idea with the little treasures is you switch
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   the toys.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   So if you pick something out and you can put something in.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   >> And also, Greg will call me and he'll say, okay, go to this
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   page on geocaching.com.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   Okay, now read me the hints again.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   >> Because like, he can't-- he's like been wandering in a field
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   for like an hour.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   It's like, okay, wait, was the rock gray or white?
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   >> It's a good deal.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   >> Well, it says gray, Greg, and 1900 people have found it
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   already.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   I don't know what's your problem.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   >> Oh, so that's the other thing is that there's a list on
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   online of how many people have already been.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   >> Exactly.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   It's a sport that's really easy to get into because if you're
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   just new at it and want to do the easy ones you can, they rate
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   different levels, but the hard ones, they can be tough.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   >> And he'll say like, okay, when was the last person?
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   I said, well, let's see, two hours ago someone was there.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   >> So it's still warm.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   >> Sunny, what's an example of a hard one?
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   What makes it hard?
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   >> Well, you know, there are these things called multi-caches or
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   puzzle caches.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   Let me give you a contrast.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   An easy one would be where you just look at your GPS receiver
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   and it tells you this one's four miles away.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   So you get in your car, you drive to it, get out of your car,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   you realize it's 500 feet away, you track it down, you look,
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   you know, under a bush or whatever.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   >> And it says some fence.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   >> That's--
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   A difficult one, and there's two reasons why it might be
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   difficult, either because the cache itself is difficult to
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   find or the terrain is like really difficult, like underwater
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   on the side of a mountain, things like that.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   >> Under water.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   They have scuba ones.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   >> Scuba cat.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   >> They warn you beforehand.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   >> Yes, they do.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   And so you can see--
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   >> Oh, yeah, I forgot my aqua long.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   [laughter]
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   >> Bring wet suits.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   >> But a multi-cache or a puzzle cache is where you have to
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   figure out several stages and use, you know, different things
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   to finally get the final coordinates on it.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   >> So what do you need to get started?
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   >> Really, all you need is, you know, a GPS, which they're
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   about $100 now for the cheap ones, and a sense of adventure,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   and that's it.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   >> And, of course, podcaster.com.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   >> Podcaster.com.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   >> Because without that, you're not really podcaster.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   >> Yeah, with that, you've got everything you need.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   >> Hey, that's great.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   Well, congratulations on the success of the podcast, and I
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   think it's really-- it's like the knitting thing.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   It's a perfect example of how this is long-tail stuff.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   >> Yes, crossover.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   >> Yeah, and it's wonderful.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   >> Yeah, it's really great.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   >> Sunny, thanks.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   And where's your wife?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   >> She's right behind you there.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   >> Well done.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   >> Don't lose him.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   Okay, next time you're out there.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   How many people like the Twit logo?
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   >> I do.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   >> Yeah, you like that.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   It's a pretty good logo.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   >> The person who designed it is here, you know.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   >> All right.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   >> Would you like to meet her?
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   >> Yes.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   >> All right.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   Dorothy, come on over here.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   >> I was going to suggest that.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   >> Come on, Dorothy.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   >> Come on, Dorothy.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   >> Dorothy Yamamoto, now you know that we had a kind of-- it wasn't
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   an official competition, but it was-- we asked people to submit logos, and we got a lot of
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   logos, and I talked to a number of designers, including Lori Lobo Walsh, who was also here.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   I don't know if she's still here, but Lori told me now, make sure you consider when
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   you look at these logos that it might be in all forms and fashions, it might be a bumper
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   sticker, might be on a t-shirt, so don't make it too complicated.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   It has to be simple and have personality, and then all of a sudden I opened this file
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   from Dorothy Yamamoto of TigerBriteGraphics.com, and it's TigerBrite.com, right?
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   >> And I went crazy.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   >> I thought this is it.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   >> I added Dorothy on Thursday.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   >> She was at the podcast Academy, and Digital Bill and Mr. Mark were there, and they were
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   talking about great logos, and they singled out the Twit logo as being a great logo.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   And I said, you know, the creator that logo is here in the Academy today, and she was
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   trying to hide in the corner totally unexpected.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   >> She's also a member of Pixel Core.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   >> And I have to say that the other thing about it, for the logo, it's not just that it looks
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   cool, but it's well designed.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   We're having a lot of fun now that we got it in 3D.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   >> 3D, you can be all off.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   >> But the thing is, the design just continues to work, which is a good sign of a good logo.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   >> It's a good logo, very simple.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   Now tell me a little bit how it came about.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   >> Well, you know, initially you indicated you wanted just a simple design up on your
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   -- on the blog.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   >> Right.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   >> And so I listened to the client.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   And based on the theme of technology, I thought, well, what's very basic?
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Electronic symbols.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   So I googled and found the site that had all these symbols.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   And I thought, well, let's find something with sort of a face.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   And so this -- I don't know what you call it -- a bell gate or --
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   >> Oh, an AND gate.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   >> It's an AND gate.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   >> Is that one of those?
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   >> Yes.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   >> Oh, so it's inclusive.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   If I like it.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   >> And it had some association with sound.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   So I thought, okay, I'll go with that.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   >> And then we turn it on its side to make it a little twit.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   >> Well, that was your design.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   >> It worked.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   I thought, hey, a little bug, a little twit.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   >> I mean, I actually think of that as being a twit.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   >> It is a twit.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   >> That is what a twit is.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   >> And I'm hoping, thanks to the Pixel Core, that twit's going to come to life down the
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   road with little movements and its little feet are just scurrying around and
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   links and stuff.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   And you're going to see a lot of more stuff.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   I've also -- we're also going to start doing twit merchandising so people get -- I have
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   some great twit decals that you can put in your window.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   I sent them to you, Dorothy, so you'll be getting --
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   >> That box.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   >> Yeah, that box.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   It's coming, I promise.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   I sent it.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   I'm sure I did.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   There's a hat.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   There's -- I mean, it just really works in a lot.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   >> Well, you know, different bottles.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   >> The sound that a twit makes is a Twitter.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   It makes a Twitter.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   >> That's perfect.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   >> There you go.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   >> Some Dorothy.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   Are you a professional graphic artist?
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   >> Well, I'm trying to get into it.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   >> You're kidding.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   >> Well, I retired from my day job a few years ago.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   And then, you know, I could -- the recession came on, so I couldn't get in graphic design
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   works.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   >> Tigerbright.com.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   If you want the twit logo designer to do your logo, we thank you.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   So much.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   It is just the cutest little bug I just love it.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   And it fits us perfectly.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   >> Okay.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   >> All right.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   Now, let's bring in somebody -- I want to read you something.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   This is from Paul McCartney.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   You heard of him, yeah?
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   >> I went to the McCartney show.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   >> Who was that show?
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   >> It was conservative.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   >> Monday night in San Jose, I was there.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   >> Did you sing a lot of music?
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   >> I was in the seventh row.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   >> He's older than us.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   >> He's getting on.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   >> It was a low risk event.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   >> What he sang yesterday.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   >> And I told my wife, I said yesterday is going to be in the --
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   >> The lineup.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   >> No, what do you call it?
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   The end.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   >> Concorde.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   >> Sure enough.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   And they'll do live and let die with pyrotechnics.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   >> Sure enough.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   >> I've never seen -- I mean, one of the great concert moments of all time for me was seeing
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   Paul McCartney and the lights go down on the stage to bring out a stool, a single spot,
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   a guitar singing yesterday, and that's the guy who wrote it.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   I don't know.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Maybe low key to you.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   I didn't see this concert.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   This is why.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   >> I also saw him in 1965.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   >> Well, that's different.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   >> At the cow pose.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   >> Could you hear anything?
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   Are you still ringing from the screens?
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   >> Not screaming.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   Well, this is what Paul McCartney said about our next guest.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   He says, the band Steadman have the songs, the musicianship, the energy and the enthusiasm
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   to blow the top off any club arena or, if given a listen, have that rare ability, the
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   rare quality, the ability to deliver.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   I like this band.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   Paul McCartney said that about Simon Steadman and his band, Simon, welcome.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   >> Thank you.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   >> This is an example of -- you were a signed artist, right?
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   You had two records to your -- >> I've had it actually had two major
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   label deals and both imploded because of company mergers.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   >> So you decided to go to the indie route?
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   >> We went indie after the first major label deal went wrong and then we actually came
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   over to America and moved over to America and got another major label deal with the lecture,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   which seems to be the kiss of death for us and the major label deals because they then
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   -- the lecture doesn't exist anymore.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   Basically, we turned up to our label one morning and we were like, where is everybody?
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   They've been fired.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   We were like, what does that mean for us?
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Well, you're going to be going to Atlantic.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   We were like, well, they don't know who we are and they have nothing invested in us.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   So we want out.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   12 months later, we got out.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   And then now we've gone into again.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   And basically, I'm putting up our entire back catalog up to this point, which is basically
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   150 downloads.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   >> Free.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   >> Absolutely free for no reason.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   My philosophy is give before you take.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   And I want to just give as much music away free and then there's a donation set up at
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   the site, which is www.steadmanband.com.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   >> S-T-E-A-D-M-A-N.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   >> That's right.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   And you can go to the site, get anything you want for free, it's CC license, do what you
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   want with it.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   And we're getting so much, so many hits as a result.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   We've got Boing Boing, a couple of weeks ago, and that the hits at the site went through
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   the movie.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   We talked at the expo to several different artists, brother Love and some other people, who have
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   really found success through podcasting, through pod safe music, through giving away
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   music.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   It's really a model that works.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   >> Well, I think that for a new band, particularly, it's the only way to get your music out there
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   to people.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   Because, you know, who's making the biggest fuss at the moment about downloading?
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   It's the record companies because they're losing out money.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   But the new bands are getting listened to and are getting heard by people that probably
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   ordinarily wouldn't hear them.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   You know, so it's a -- the record companies need to wise up to the fact that giving away
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   music is not bad.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   And it's not about 30 second samples.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   It's not about one song.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   Give away a whole album.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   Because the band are going to make money.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   I mean, we as a band made all of our money from film licensing, TV licensing, touring,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   merchandise, but mostly film and TV.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   >> Really?
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   >> You need to sell 250,000 records before you see any money.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   >> And that's also the classic model anyway for musicians, right?
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   Even when they're signed to big labels, they're not making that much money from the label.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   >> You don't make any money from a record deal unless you're like Madonna, Coldplay or
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   U2.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   You know, that's the bottom line.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   >> And even they tour.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   Even they have to make more money.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   >> Well, I think it's just neat to see a band that's been signed.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   It has a major label to also go this room.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   Yeah, if you're young and there's no other way to do it, but you probably could have found another label.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   You decided not to.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   >> Absolutely.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   I mean, we could have, but you know, labels are in such a hole at the moment.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   I mean, they're not signing and they're not -- there's no such thing as a publishing deal anymore.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   People don't really get publishing deals.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   >> And that's the only way to really make money is if you own the publishing.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   >> Pretty much.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   You've got a very mind is publishing and real companies are pretty much loans.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   You're pretty much getting a loan now.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   And with a record company when you pay back that loan, you're still only earning a minor percentage of CD sales.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   So, you know, I was considering doing mic prepayments at the site, putting up new songs and doing like an iTunes just for myself.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   But I figured first things first, give away as much as you can free.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   I mean, 150 downloads is ridiculous, really.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   But we were like, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   Let's just do it.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   And so we gave all this stuff away free.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   >> Are you getting air play, radio, or play out of this?
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   >> We're getting podcasts going crazy.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   >> So I think radio no longer breaks music.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   But podcasts do.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   >> See, the thing about radio is it's all restricted by advertising, corporate, payola.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   You know, when we were starting, we were the number three most added in the country.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   And we were trying to get played on radio stations.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   I was traveling around radio stations, playing my guitar.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Basically, you know, you go into people you might not necessarily like and try and persuade them to play your music.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   Right?
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   And we were like, are you going to play?
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   And he said, well, Blondie played us $4,000 to pay their singles.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   So they're probably going to get played and you're not.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   >> And I used to -- I mean, I used to --
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   >> Old promo guy right here.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   >> Not only was I promo guy, I used to be a music director.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   >> Right.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   >> I'll turn it back to you.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   >> I have been a music director.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   >> So my job was to, you know, when Nirvana and Pearl Jam came out, and that was my job was to pick these bands.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   And there was an enormous amount of pressure.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   I mean, half the time you were picking songs because it was the right thing.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   But half the time we were looking at the charts.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   Like, who's going up?
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   Who should we make sure that we're playing?
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   Who are we going to be able to make a return?
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   >> It's self-reinforcing.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   If you're not in that group, you're out of the box.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   >> And it was all about hype because what we would do is we'd be sitting here and I'd be looking at --
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   if you saw something moving on the charts, if it had a bullet, you know, moving up the charts, you were like,
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   well, maybe I should put that in.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   And if you put it in and then reported that, then it would go faster.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   And it was all on the churn.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   And there were a lot of really bad songs that just got a lot of hype.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   >> That's the thing.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   It's a lot to answer for all the crap music that's out of the moment.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   That's getting air play, you know.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   And that's what's so great about podcasting is that people can play whatever the hell they want without any restrictions.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   >> It might be a crappy song, but at least you didn't pay for it.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   >> Exactly.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   And I think that also -- the thing is, is that I think that the record companies are shooting themselves in the fun.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   When they won't let anyone -- like, people in part want to do podcasts, I want to do radio podcasts.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   You can't.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   And that's the thing that's insane.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   And then you have the groundswell that's starting to start.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   Bands like yours starting to just say, you know, we're going to start bypassing that.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   Then you also have the MySpace.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   >> MySpace has been amazing for us as well.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   >> They're selling -- it's allowing the consumers to step in and actually start to choose what they want rather than being
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   told what we're going to buy later.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   >> Absolutely.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   And if a band loves you, they will support you.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   If someone just is a casual listener, they're probably not going to buy your record anyway.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   >> Right.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   >> And there's definitely a lot of bands that if I heard their music and I was listening to it, I'd send them a donation.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   I'd send them money going.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   >> I think it's going to be very good for Stedman.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   >> Thank you, Lee.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   >> Thank you for joining us.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   We really appreciate what you all the best.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   Go to Stedman.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   >> Stedmanband.com and it's S-T-E-A-D-M-A-N.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   >> Make sure you download all 150 songs.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   >> 100,000.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   >> Make copies for all your friends.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   Thank you, Simon.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   >> We take care.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   >> We have two minutes.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   We've been told that they're going to close the building.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   So we want to get Mac casts Adam Christensen sitting down here real quickly and say goodbye to him.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   And we also want to thank all of you in the audience for sticking around and being here.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   And also thank you so much for listening to Twid.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   We really, really appreciate the support.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   It really makes a difference to us.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   And thanks to the folks at AOL Radio who put our podcast on their podcast channel and also give us the bandwidth.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   Because otherwise, I don't know how I paid for this at AOLMusic.com.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   Mac cast is one of my favorite podcasts.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   Adam Christensen is here.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   He is the Mac cast Daddy.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   >> I love to hear that.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   >> Thank you so much.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   >> And in early podcast, you were one of the first few.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   >> I was in September.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   >> Pretty early.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   That December.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   So I was kind of in that second round, I would say.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   I wasn't right up there with the first round.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   >> One of the many podcast celebrities I've wanted to meet and have in that year.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   I was hoping Donna Drew would come by and it's just been really fun.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   This event is amazing.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   >> This has been an amazing, amazing expo.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   I'm just completely overwhelmed.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   And I've told so many people, you know, a year ago, this wouldn't have happened.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   >> To have this much capacity, you know, this much happened in a year, less than a year,
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   really.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   >> It's my fervent hope that all the people who came here will come back, go out, revitalize,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   energize, charge up about podcasting, spread the word, tell everybody about podcasts,
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   maybe even make their own podcasts.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   Because that's really what it's all about.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   We got to get it outside of the early adopters.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   >> Okay.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   >> And I think we're on the cusp of it right now.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   >> We're right on the edge.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   >> Lots of tools and technologies coming available.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   >> We've seen such growth in such a short period of time and I think we're about to see, I
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   think as fast and as crazy as it's been, we ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   >> That's for sure.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   >> That's what I think.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   Doug, it's so great to have you.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   >> Great to be here.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   >> Thanks, Mike.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   >> And we're going to talk about the conversations.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   Always welcome.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   >> And I've got to meet Mr. Gibson.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   >> Isn't he great?
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   >> What am I here with?
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   >> He's my name is Steve Gibson of grc.com.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   I'm glad we were in your neighborhood.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   We get you back on Twitch.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   We're going to figure it out, Alex, right, that we can get Steve on.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   We're going to use his new client, Steve's been writing his special IP television.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   It's going to give him full fidelity and we'll be able to have him in effect in our studio.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   >> It'll be free.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   I don't know when.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   >> Soon.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   He's working on it.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   >> I don't do deadlines.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   >> Written in assembler.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   It'll be small and fast.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   >> Better late than never is the name of his growth.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   >> I think Steve has never succeeded in learning any high-level language.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   >> That's what it is, isn't it?
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   >> I just can't figure those out.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   >> He writes in 1886 because that's all he can write in.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   >> I don't know.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   >> Alex Lindsay of the Pixelcore, thank you for driving all this way and bringing the crew
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   and the board and your brother Joe and the gang.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   Why don't we introduce the camera crew for change.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   We never let them get any credit.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   >> We've got Brent by.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   He's down here.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   >> Warren here who is actually a long-time listener.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   He does video encoding down here in LA.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   Is he a member of the Pixelcore or just decided to step in?
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   >> He just stepped in.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   >> We started talking.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   We were talking about compression.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   >> He's great.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   >> We got into this conversation.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   He stepped in here.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   And then we have Ken Geketa.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   >> Who is always on camera for us.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   Ken G's one of our stalwarts.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   >> He's one of our super techs within the Pixelcore.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   >> And he's got a big lens.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   >> I'm not going to say anything.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   >> Silence.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, another twit is in the can.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   >> This is weekend tech.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   [MUSIC]
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   >> This is a craps society.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   >> This is a crack generation.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   >> We do tech.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   >> Tech.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   >> Tech.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   >> My friends, my twits, are you ready?
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   >> Yeah, the Twitter army.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   >> I don't know what the answer is.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   I really don't.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   >> Let me introduce the table mates.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   John C. DeBore.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   Kevin Rose.

[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   David the Casper.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   >> The highest, no problem.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   David the Casper.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   >> David the Casper.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   >> It's a fool's paradise.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   >> David this one.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   >> This is amazing.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   >> I'm going to do it.
