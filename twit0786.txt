[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.400]   I'm very excited
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.840]   To say hello to my good dear friend Mike Elgin from Elgin calm used to be parapetetic now. He's locked down in place
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.240]   That's right. Well, I actually drove for 12 hours yesterday all the way from Washington in one trip with one stop Leo
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.480]   What and you never got out?
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   What what were you doing up there?
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.480]   Well, actually Amir and I just bought a forest in Washington come on
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.520]   Yeah, 17 acres and we're gonna build a little cabin or something there you're teasing me. Yeah, no. Oh, this is my dream
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.000]   we've been working on it for like six months. We found the perfect piece of land and
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.960]   We just been sort of hiking through it
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.360]   Oh, wait a while I check Lisa that you're doing that because this is our dream has been because basically the state is burning around us
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.800]   And we think maybe it's time to leave maybe this was shocking
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.840]   It the smoke went all the way to north of halfway up
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.200]   Oregon and that the California smoke is just blanketing the entire
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.080]   Area but by the time we got to Portland. It was like really nice air quality. I
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.920]   Might be visiting your forest
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.560]   Please do we're gonna build a little cabin and will you know
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.840]   You have you and Lisa up there and will will barbecue things are you gonna have actually internet electricity running water?
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.360]   What are you gonna have?
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.360]   It I do have a mobile broadband
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.360]   Activity, but I'm counting on Starlink. I'm counting on you. Me too. I must me too. Yeah, I can't wait for that
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   Yeah, if Elon Musk is gonna ruin the world at least he can do it to our benefit
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.000]   That yeah, exactly. Thank you Mike Elgin also with us. Oh
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.560]   JJ Stone we call him Oh
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.840]   Doctor
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.840]   Because he's been writing scripts since
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.880]   1920 what is that red cross?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.520]   So this is my logo, but I'm just letting Mike know that when you see this in the corner of your forest
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.520]   I'm only gonna take up about
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.240]   One in the corner acres. So just know that I'm gonna stake my flag on that little corner
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.280]   And I'm just gonna go back. Oh a shack just to hang out with just so you just see when you see this
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.560]   You know, it's me
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   You're always welcome. That's also effective when the bears come after you just show them that
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.960]   Well, I'm wondering because that logo does look a little like a red cross
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.280]   I'm wondering if this is to prevent you from being struck from above by
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.520]   Cruz missiles or something. I mean what I'm also wearing a shirt that says my life. It says dear police
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.520]   I am a white woman
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.720]   Named Karen name Karen. It's got a full name as possible in these streets. Yeah, I don't blame you
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.480]   here's Owens
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.120]   sheet music from the 1920s. Oh
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.840]   doctor
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.320]   Oh doctor. Oh doctor. This actually comes super excited about that fine. Whoever found it. Yeah, I think are one of our listeners
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.080]   Who sent this to me? I don't think this was the inspiration for your nickname, but nevertheless
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.720]   This was back during prohibition when doctors were a light allowed to write prescriptions for liquor
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.400]   And they were to send cocaine. Yeah. Yeah, man. Doctor should be your friend
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.160]   All the drugs are good back then basic of heroin stuff. Yeah, heron was invented by bear
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.560]   Yep
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.160]   It's a trademark from but they don't I don't think they're enforcing it
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.600]   And now I am so pleased to welcome back to our microphone somebody who hasn't been here in a while
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.280]   But he's got a new book and we're we're dragging him out of obscurity
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.480]   To welcome the wonderful the talented Corey doctor. Oh
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.720]   Good to see you Corey. Oh my god. It's been a long time not since strangulation has was it little brother?
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   I was talking to you about then
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:21.520]   Well, gosh, it might have been or or pirate cinema or home or maybe home line the sequel to little brother
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.360]   I think it was home remember. That's what it was. It was homeland and then now you have a new book just coming out in October
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.640]   Tell me about that
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.360]   Yeah, it's the third little brother book. So it's the sequel to homeland and
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.600]   It's an adult standalone novel that
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.680]   Follows the same characters, but from a different point of view
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.440]   So Masha who's the young woman who's at the beginning in the end of the first two books who works first for the DHS
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.240]   And then for a surveillance company that's modeled little on like Palantir or the NSO group
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:59.580]   It's her story and it's about how she spent her career building tech tools to put down democratic opposition movements as well as to like
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.240]   Hancha hotties things that she could tell herself. She was doing the right thing and
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.200]   Now she's moved back to Northern California
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.740]   And her best friend is a black lives matter activist who's being targeted with the same tools that she developed literally the same
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.980]   Tools that she developed and it's about her kind of understanding the role of tech and justice struggles and what it means to be an ally
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.980]   Rather than declaring yourself to be kind of the technologies are for a movement and start dictating how people are allowed to use stuff
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.380]   And and you know kind of digs into some pretty chewy questions about
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.060]   technology self-determination
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:40.380]   Personal ethics and and how people talk themselves into doing absolutely ghastly things and what it takes to bring them back from the bright from the brink
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.620]   very timely obviously
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.140]   Yeah, what's the name?
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.380]   It's called a tax surface. It comes out on October 13th
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.340]   There's an audiobook that is also coming out that Amber Benson from Buffy red. Oh nice
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.300]   Yeah, and I would point out you don't put your audiobooks on audible.com you like
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.740]   The and I've been I've been using it ever since you recommended it downpour
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.780]   Yeah, downpour is really good or Libra dot fms also really good you can nominate a
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.380]   Bookstore an independent bookstore where you go to window shop for books and then every time you buy an audiobook from them
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.220]   They tip your local bookstore. Oh, which is terrific
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:27.700]   Yeah, and they so I I retained my audiobook rights because you know publishers if you can't sell on audible
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.220]   They can't make any money, right?
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.440]   so I
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.700]   self-fund my own audiobooks and
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:40.220]   Use the same studios and the same talent as as I would you know if McMillan or or Random House audio we're doing the audio
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:47.780]   Literally like the last one I did McMillan did it and this one I did in the same studio with the same director nice and
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.660]   You know I sell them myself, but this one
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.980]   I'm also going to be kick-starting it to do presales as well as presales of the ebooks
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.340]   So that'll be up in about a week and a half
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.140]   And we're really hoping to show how
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.340]   Authors with traditional publishers can use crowdfunding platforms to make money for everybody
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.700]   You know if you buy an e-book from Kickstarter, I'm the retailer
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.260]   I get the 30% Amazon would normally get but then my publisher gets the rest they give me 25% back as a royalty
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.820]   My agent gets his share everybody wins in that situation
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.820]   The reader gets DRM free multi-format ebooks with no license no terms of service
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:32.060]   You know like the only terms of service are you bought it you own it don't violate copyright
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.140]   Law not like by being stupid enough to be my customer
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.580]   You agree that I'm allowed to come over to your house and punch your grandmother
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.580]   And we're doing to wear and make long-distance calls and so you know it's a good deal all around
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:50.020]   You get the same product only better and then we don't you know help a monopolist get richer. Yeah
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:58.540]   Always so inspired by Corey's willingness to kind of find new pathways
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.260]   For his art and his creativity and you've always been really kind of free with your stuff
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.340]   You know creative commencing it publishing it in your on your blog
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.660]   In fact you're doing someone comes to town someone leaves to town you're reading it on your blog right now
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.160]   You can listen to it chapter by chapter
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.780]   It's really it's really cool what you're doing. Thank you for doing all that. I appreciate that Leo. Thank you
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:28.580]   And you are you still at the EFF or what are you what are you doing these days besides writing a madman?
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:36.060]   I'm also my title is special consultant to EFF the major project I work on right now is is competition
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.140]   It's a new area for us
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.400]   But one that's become a lot more urgent a lot of the issues that we work on really boil down to competition issues
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.280]   Used to be that when tech was a little more diverse in terms of how many companies there were not in terms of the
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.480]   Makeup for the people who worked at those companies
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.580]   But when there was like more diversity in the sector when there were a lot more firms
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.900]   There was always be one company who'd be like, okay, whatever it is all the other companies are doing bad
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.780]   We're gonna push for the opposite not because we're good people
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.620]   But because we think we might steal some of their customers
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:12.100]   But you know like people look at that that photo of all the leaders of the tech companies sitting around a table with Donald Trump after the election
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.860]   And they're like oh my god
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.380]   How could they sit down with Donald Trump which you know fair enough?
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:22.700]   But like for me the real message is how is it that all of tech fits around a single leatherette table and Trump Tower right
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.220]   constant you know concentration of power yeah
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.780]   Yeah, so you know that's where we've ended up working and there's a lot of people thinking about this stuff
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.620]   But a lot of the stuff that they're proposing isn't great to be honest
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:40.100]   They've got their heart in the right place, but their ideas are not informed by a solid understanding of tech
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.460]   So you know for example like in Europe
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:49.740]   They just passed a law last year forcing all the tech companies to install copyright filters, right?
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.060]   So there's like you know Google spent a hundred million dollars on content ID
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.980]   So effectively like if you don't have a hundred million dollars to build a filter
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.780]   You can't operate in Europe anymore
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.700]   And then you know once you take all the competition that they might that might do to Google what Google did to say
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.700]   Altavista out of the marketplace
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.740]   You know it's not like Google is going to become easier to negotiate with or kinder to musicians
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.340]   So you know give it ten years and they'll be even stronger. They'll have even more dominant position
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.540]   The copyright filters will be taking down more innocent speech
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.180]   You know dolphins caught in the tune in it and musicians will still be getting a raw ordeal
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:33.540]   So you know the work that we're doing is about what a like a pro-competitive agenda for tech looks like that doesn't just cement their dominance
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.460]   But actually make space for like cooperatives non-profits
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:45.820]   nascent local competitors SMEs like to have a big weird web again not just like five giant websites phobis screenshots of the other four and
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:54.500]   You know that looks like stuff like interoperability mandates where you force companies to open up APIs and also like reform to laws
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.220]   That get in the way of other kinds of interoperability like the DMCA and the computer fraud and abuse act
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:06.580]   So if you want to like plug something new into something that exists right the way that like Apple did when they reverse engineered the Microsoft
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:13.180]   Office suite and made I work you know if you wanted to do that with iTunes and you reverse engineered the iTunes file format and made a player
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:20.700]   That could play the iTunes proprietary files they would you know sue you and probably swear out a criminal complaint against you under the DMCA
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:28.700]   So you know just restoring the kind of interoperability that used to be the source of dynamism in the industry where where people would
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.980]   You know rudely shoulder their way into markets rather than begging the incumbents for permission
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:40.820]   We call it like competitive compatibility right like adding compatibility without asking the companies for permission first
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.700]   And so you know we're working on that in a number of different fora
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:51.020]   Working on things like blanket licenses for music rather than rather than negotiated licenses because right now
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.900]   You know Facebook Google Spotify they can go out and get licenses for all the music
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:02.700]   But a small competitor can't and and all that means is that there are is less negotiating leverage for the musicians
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:10.300]   And so you know building a system that works a lot more like a nightclub where like one DJ doesn't get the exclusive right to play the top 40 signals
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:18.860]   Which means that no one club can become the only place where popular music is played and start to squeeze the musicians in order to you know
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.420]   Guarantee play like we want it we want to expand that
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:32.460]   Into the digital realms that we can have the same kind of competition and not allow these companies that don't really add anything to the music to serve as gatekeepers to it
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:39.100]   It's it's a challenge because while I think anybody paying attention can probably think of
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:46.980]   Clever ways to make the world a better place these days and can it's pretty easy to pinpoint the fractures in
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.660]   The world and where things are going wrong. It's a lot harder to think of a way to actually implement
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.220]   This stuff do you spend energy on that because well yeah, I want to I by the way
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.260]   I want to recommend people read the post went up this week on
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:07.260]   On one zero on medium one zero dot medium dot com how to destroy surveillance capitalism
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:13.300]   Which is a it's a prescription in effect for for how to how to fix this issue
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.820]   And it's easy for us to see that the dominance of a handful of companies is a problem
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.620]   It's a lot harder to think of how you how you fix that. They're not gonna go easily
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:27.260]   Government yeah our government at least in the United States is run by money
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.860]   And so of course the biggest companies like in fact, that's Larry Lessig remember wanted to very much wanted to eliminate
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.340]   DRM, but he realized he's not that's never gonna happen
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:43.260]   Unless you change how political financing works. So his you know, he changed his goals
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.260]   He said well first we got to fix we got to fix money the problem of money in government
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:53.400]   So there's an there's another copyright scholar a colleague of Larry's a guy named James Boyle
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:59.980]   From Duke University who has a really good riff about this which is that before the term ecology was coined
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.740]   There were people who cared about like owls and people who cared about the ozone layer and while they didn't like hate each other
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.380]   They didn't really see themselves as fighting in the same fight
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.100]   They were they were issue based campaigners and the term ecology said that like yes
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.260]   You're interested in owls and I'm interested in the ozone layer
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:23.820]   But what we're both fighting for is ecology and it took you know a thousand different issues and turned it into a movement with a thousand ways in and
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.340]   movements get stuff done and so in terms of monopoly and like it's opposite pluralism
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.620]   Which is why you know these days in the pluralistic dot net in terms of of monopoly
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.540]   There are people who are really worried about monopoly
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.380]   Even if they don't care about tech and they don't know it
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.540]   But they're all on the same side like you know
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:48.660]   I take off my glasses and it says made in Italy because they're all over people's glasses and all over peoples is a subsidiary of a company called
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:56.580]   Zautica which has bought every single eyewear brand you've ever heard of as well as lens crafters target optical Sears optical the
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.780]   major lens manufacturer and
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:06.100]   Sure some glass hot. Yeah, they own Oakley. They own every Versace. They own every brand you've ever heard of
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.860]   They've raised prices a thousand percent in ten years if you need prescription glasses
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.500]   You care about monopoly even if you don't know it yet and then like you know people who watch John
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.820]   It is really like the frog in the boiling water because yeah
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.620]   I pay 700 bucks for my glasses now when I only paid a hundred fifty ten years ago
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:28.540]   But it kind of went up gradually so I didn't really notice and I certainly didn't know it was like Zautica's fault
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.660]   But there's a lot of people who have more urgent causes right like if you're a pro wrestling fan
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:39.980]   Then you might have noticed in the last couple of years that all the wrestlers you love are begging on go fund me for money to pay
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.460]   Their medical bills so they can die with dignity in their 50s
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:48.620]   And they were related injuries and it's because Vince McMahon bought all the other wrestling leagues there used to be 30 now
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:54.740]   There's one he's he's reframed all of his workers as contractors and you took away their health insurance
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:01.940]   And so wrestling fans also have common cause and it's like it's like ozone layer and owls right there were people who cared about the ozone
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.340]   Layer they didn't really understand what was going on with the owls
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.900]   They knew that there was something really bad going on with the ozone layer when they heard about the hours
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:14.460]   They're like that's really alarming, but I'm focused on the ozone layer and it wasn't until we got into ecology rather than issues
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.580]   That people were able to say
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:22.940]   We're all fighting for the same thing and like even though the way I'm fighting for it is by working on the ozone layer
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:29.660]   I am going to support the ecology movement per se and we are on the brink of people who worried about
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.220]   You know concentration and meatpacking all of a sudden that became pretty salient this year
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:40.620]   Right as they as slaughterhouses also became charnel houses where meat packers were dying and sickening due to
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.220]   Massive concentration in the sector that allows them to treat their workers really badly
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.940]   Chicken farmers have some of the highest suicide rate in the country
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:56.300]   It's because there's there's only three major chicken packers left and there's a process that they use called chickenization for their labor force
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.420]   Where the farmers are technically independent workers
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:06.540]   But they have to buy the coop that the that perdue tells them to buy they have to buy the feed they have to use the medicine
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.180]   They have to put the chickens on the lighting schedule that produce specifies and then perdue
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.620]   Tells them how much they're going to pay at the very end and they get to calculate it
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.020]   So it's just enough to keep them growing chickens
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.940]   But not enough to let them go ahead and if that sounds familiar
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:27.980]   It's because it's the same thing that uber drivers have to do with so every sector is facing this kind of both monopoly and
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.540]   Opsony where you have a buyer who's concentrated all the power among their suppliers
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:38.340]   And you also have a seller who's concentrated all the power among the consumers and and it's like an hourglass
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.420]   And they're these people who are manning the pinch between the two bulbs
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.940]   And you know we like to think that those of us on this side of the bulb have nothing to come with those of us on that's out of the bulb
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.300]   It's not true. We're like we're all on the same side
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:54.580]   We're on the side of people who want to get rid of the people in the middle running the pinch and this is how we got trust busting
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.340]   You know a hundred years ago. This is how we got the new deal is that people woke up one day
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:05.980]   And they said standard oil is the same problem as the rail trust is the same problem as the electricity trust is same problem as AT&T
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.980]   It's the same problem as A&P and
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.700]   They got together and they made common cause and you know we're coming to that moment again or at least
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.840]   That's I how I think we can find our way out of it
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.540]   Cory I think if you successfully unite all of these causes into a single cause
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:27.140]   We should retain chickenization is the word that describes what happens to the victims. I
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:33.380]   Don't agree. I I learned that word from a Zephyr Teachout book that just came out called break him up
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.500]   But she got it from someone else and I forgot who it is someone who wrote a a big exposé on the meatpacking industry
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.900]   But you know like it's the same thing with farmers. It's the same thing with
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:49.820]   Hospitals right like the reason that hospitals are as brittle as they are the reason our medical system is as brittle as it is
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:55.520]   Is because private equity funds have been buying and merging hospitals and making them more and more
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.380]   Debt-loaded laying off primary staff and hiring them back as contractors doing all the stuff
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:06.700]   They did that made toys are us into a failing business except it's our entire health care system such as it is in this country
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.000]   So, you know, it's also one of JC JC penny went and
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.700]   Sears Sears. Yeah
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.560]   Yeah, it's an it what's happening
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:22.020]   What's actually the good thing about COVID-19 is all the fractures in society are being brought to the the surface because they are brittle and
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:28.680]   And all it took is was, you know a little crack and the whole thing is starting to shatter and it doesn't look good
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.040]   It's gonna I fear though that we're gonna it's gonna be a very disruptive
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:38.960]   Period of several decades as we work this all out and I'm not yeah
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.600]   I'm not at all convinced that your sides gonna win
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.840]   I feel like the pinch has a lot of power and and and you know, it's interesting how
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   You bring up the word ecology because the other thing that they do is they change the language
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:59.880]   So it used to be everybody was against pollution. Nobody's for pollution, but you change it to climate change. Well now we can have a debate and
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:08.160]   So there are all sorts of techniques that the the people in power used to keep us from
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.440]   Revolting against the chickenization of the world
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.800]   Very interesting. I call it the climate emergency instead of climate change. That's a better way. It's a good term for all of us to adopt
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.760]   Yeah, nobody's nobody's against pollution. Nobody's for pollution everybody's against pollution
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.760]   But climate change well who knows what that is maybe it's just a natural force
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.120]   It changes all around you. It's normal, right?
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:38.240]   All right, I do I think we should since you brought up monopsony where there is a big monopsony
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:45.200]   Right now fighting a giant battle and we're gonna talk about epic versus apple in just a second. I've got a suggestion
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:51.360]   Guy named rayjay, you know rayjay said I'm gonna create something a little bit better for a little bit less
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.160]   He invented raycon. These are great
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.520]   Wireless earbuds before you go dropping hundreds of dollars for a pair
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:06.120]   You got to check out these beautiful wireless earbuds from raycon about half the price of other premium wireless earbuds
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.640]   Not because their half is good, but because they don't mark up twice as much
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:15.240]   They sound just as amazing as the other top brands, you know, they are very very good. These are the everyday
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:22.320]   25 earbuds. These are their new models. They look beautiful. They sound great six hours of playtime
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.920]   That's just the buds themselves and of course, it's a battery case
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.360]   So you put them in and you charge them up and you get another six hours seamless Bluetooth pairing
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.360]   Very easy, you know just to pair it with your iPhone your Android phone anything that has Bluetooth
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   I do it with my laptop too the base
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:44.680]   Fantastic there's more base and it's a nice ice a compact design with a nice noise
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.960]   Isolating fit and that's really important not only so you don't hear the baby crying behind you oh
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:58.120]   My my books started right away talk about seamless Bluetooth pairing
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.800]   Listening to the the splinted in the vial. I thought put it in all of a sudden. I'm hearing it these sound so good
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:11.280]   Then they're very very comfortable. So if conference calls where you're gonna you know nowadays. We're wearing our earbuds all day

[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.520]   Apple voices epic the battle
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:27.440]   Rages on epic of course creators of fortnight a free game
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.840]   You will not find an update there. They got an update. They said on an email to everybody saying hey
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.360]   We're gonna be updating
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.960]   Fortnite with new Marvel characters, but you iPhone folks you won't be getting it because Apple is yanked our developer
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.760]   Permit they did go to court
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:51.520]   Epic seeking an injunction a restraining order from a judge in the ninth district of Northern California telling Apple you can't yank
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.640]   our developer
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:58.880]   Permit the judge said no Apple can you violated contract, but she did do the right thing judge Rogers said
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.560]   You cannot Apple
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.640]   Revoked the developer permissions for epic international sub separate arm
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:13.720]   Which does the unreal engine because that would affect a lot of bystanders people who are not involved in this
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:20.520]   It all comes down apples 30% big on everything sold in the app store. This is one. I don't know
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.400]   I'll be honest. I've heard the debate from both sides
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   Over and over again. I don't know where I come down on this and on the one hand Apple has created an environment
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:35.800]   Everybody wants to be a part of if you were in a best by selling software. You were giving them a lot more than 30%
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.280]   That's kind of the norm for distribution
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.920]   On the other hand if you're not in the app store on the iPhone you can't be installed on the iPhone
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.280]   So in that respect that's a monopsony apple controls
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.400]   all the buyers I
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:57.880]   I don't know. I think I think the problem is that I think it's the the app developers themselves who grant apple the monopoly
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.440]   monopsony
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.640]   And often I have to right to do it
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:12.840]   They feel like they have to be on the iOS platform, but there are lots and lots of disgruntled developers
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:19.400]   Like epic like facebook like you know lots of lots of them if they were to organize
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.240]   And collectively leave the platform
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.320]   Apple would be stuck with the same problem they had in the
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.000]   90s
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.120]   Back in the 90s most people didn't use apple operating systems because there were no games
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:43.720]   Right and so if you know the reason apple has this monopsony is because developers don't follow their principles
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:50.120]   They don't put their money where their mouth is they complain they sue they do all this kind of stuff
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.280]   But the only thing that's going to get apple to be more friendly toward
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.840]   developers is
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.880]   when
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:04.120]   Users don't buy iPhones because the games and social networks and other things that they want to use are not on the apple platform
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.680]   facebook actually
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.040]   had to
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.400]   Pull an update to the facebook app they were going to introduce this you know facebook marketplace
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.600]   Uh that allowed influencers and businesses to hold host virtual events
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.520]   Uh because it would be purchased through the iphone facebook
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.840]   said, uh look 30 you're going to get a 30 percent
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:33.000]   Loss on this because apple is going to take 30 percent. We just want to let you know you're only going to get 70
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.320]   of your earnings apple said uh
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.760]   You can't tell people that and facebook was forced to take that information out
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.720]   Uh apple says it's irrelevant
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.120]   Uh, oh doctor. Where do you stand on this one?
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.320]   This is like the 80th thousand time you've had to have this conversation
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.160]   It's non-stop folks it but it's never going to go away until we fix it right
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.120]   That might already made the example apple is just a bully right now
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.800]   Okay, so either everybody takes their ball and go home at the same time
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.960]   Or apple just going to keep slow rolling you and their make apple has a
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.480]   Shear plan of domination and it's it's impressive
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.040]   They're cutting out intel
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.840]   Intel's dead in the water. They're embarrassed themselves and off-rrucks
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.840]   Then they're going to turn everything into an ipad where you have to get everything through the app store
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:29.240]   You you are looking at complete domination if someone doesn't check them like a facebook a twitter
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.440]   Uh tik tok if i was facebook right now, i would go and buy tik tok
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.480]   And then go to jack and be like look let's just walk off of fate off apple for like one day
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:45.000]   Just shut everything now for a day. Yeah, you know how many grandmas and 12 year olds would be jumping out of windows
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.680]   Let me give you a cheap sam song for 15 dollars. It would happen immediately because
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.040]   Instagram alone, you're gonna do that would be the end of it
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   I I do have to say though epic is not the perfect poster child
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.880]   For us it's pretty clear that really what they're they're not worried about the 30
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.000]   percent
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.560]   What they really want to do is put a store on there and apple really won't let them do that a game store
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.040]   They want to do a steam style game store on ios and apples
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.720]   Maybe perhaps in this case apple's right because they said well
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.080]   But you can't you know
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.600]   One of the premises of the app store is we've carefully check everything on here to make sure it's safe
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.040]   If somebody else has a store within our store, we can't do that
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.480]   So that you know if that's if apple's aware of this strategy, maybe they're reasonable
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.560]   Of course apple then twists the knife because all week long
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.000]   They're promoting a fortnight competitor pub g
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:45.800]   On the app store a new era of pub g mobile's coming featuring an overhaul map and a bold new look
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:52.760]   There's like well, you don't need to play fortnight. You can play off player unknowns battleground. It's still a battle royale
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.240]   All right, cori
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:00.120]   You have to help me because I cannot figure it out. I don't know whose side i'm on here both sides
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.040]   seem to be
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:02.840]   You know
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.600]   Work in the angles a little bit here. It's clear epic planned this they had a movie
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.480]   You know a woman throwing her unicorn hammer through the apple screen and all that stuff
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:16.440]   They knew this was going to be a problem. They actually set it all up. They teed it up and launched it
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.000]   Uh, so they look a little cynical
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.320]   What's the answer here?
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.640]   Well, I think you need to tease apart some different issues
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:30.600]   So like one is this question of whether or not you should be able to choose what software you install on your device, right?
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.840]   So like that's not a question about um
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.240]   whether uh
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.600]   You know apple should have the right to decide which software they make available to you
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.640]   It's a separate question, right? The question of like should I be allowed to
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.760]   Find someone who makes software and for that person and me to privately agree
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.440]   That i'm going to run their software on a device that I gave apple a thousand dollars for even if apple doesn't like it
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.400]   And it's a pretty hard proposition to defend and you know when people are rather to oppose
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:08.680]   And when people do oppose it, it's this weird kind of culty no-true Scotsman argument where they're like apple users like
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:17.240]   Not having another store and i'm like who do you suppose it is that is is trying to do the sideloading if not apple users, right?
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.840]   It's not like
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.800]   Samsung users are the ones clamoring for the right to sideload on iphones, right?
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.720]   It's iphone owners that are doing it
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.680]   It's just it's just like the right to repair argument with apple where they're like apple users apple customers
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.000]   Love taking their phones to the genius bar and they don't want to use an independent repair place
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.680]   Well, if that were true
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.600]   We could have a million independent repair places and they they'd be like the maytag repair guy
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.960]   They'd just be like cobwebs and tumbleweeds because no apple customer would bring them a phone
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.760]   What they're saying is if you are the kind of apple customer who wants to bring your phone to an independent store
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:59.640]   You're doing it wrong and i don't count it was an actual apple customer and that's not how private property works
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.240]   Go ahead mike
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.440]   Oh, sorry
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:10.760]   Just to be clear about what this means and and you got it exactly right that you pull the thread out of the sweater and you end up with that
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.560]   Bear fact apple is both a monopoly and a monopsony right?
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.520]   That's why they're so successful. So this is the
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:23.720]   Dynamic that makes them a monopoly nobody can install another operating system on their phones
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.800]   They have a 100 they have the most perfect monopoly in history
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.200]   on apple hardware
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.800]   On all of their devices or even a storm alternate store right? Yeah, that's the thing
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:42.200]   Right and you know the apple has this argument that we we use this power that we've accrued to ourselves
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.840]   Wisely right we only use it to make sure that bad things aren't in there and only good things are in there
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.040]   And we know that like on the one hand they just sometimes make bad judgments
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.560]   So we could remember when they pulled a dictionary because it had swear words
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.280]   The years they spent blocking
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.280]   Apps that told you whenever an american drone killed a civilian overseas
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:08.040]   You know the time they blocked an app by by or a book rather by by
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:13.880]   Seth god gone because it had a link to amazon in the book
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:18.120]   It was a book about how to how to do digital publishing and it linked to amazon
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.280]   So sometimes their judgment isn't very good
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:27.240]   And you know like one of the things that that helps people have better judgment is the risk that if they make bad judgment people
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:32.360]   Might go somewhere else right like that that is the thing that disciplines are our conduct
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.360]   You know, it's like anyone who's who's ever raised a kid with a partner knows that um
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.240]   You know, sometimes if they don't like your answer, they'll go and ask your your wife or husband or partner
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.640]   For a different answer. It's called splitting. Yeah
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.240]   Yeah
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.920]   It's a Communist party. They say that our censorship protects you from pornography terrorism and democracy
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.480]   And we the poo it's actually much more it's sharper than that because
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.600]   When the Chinese government ordered apple to use that power that they'd accrued to themselves
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.560]   To remove all working vp ends from the app store
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:08.280]   So that the Chinese government could spy on their own people at a moment in which they had just put a million
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:16.040]   Weigers in concentration camps and a human rights tribunal had upheld the conclusion that they were arresting Falun Gong members to harvest their organs
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   Apple did it right so apple's statement that we only use this power to keep you safe is not true
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.080]   It's the only 30 percent on the organ sales
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:30.680]   Yeah, exactly. Yeah 30 percent of a kidney. So, you know, it's it's like we
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.760]   Only we only do this to keep you safe or to make ourselves money
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:41.160]   Sometimes making ourselves money and keeping you safe is on the same side, but when it's not we're going to take the money deal
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.600]   I have to point out though that google does
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.480]   Offer side loads on android
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:52.440]   Tim swinney when they first put fortnight on android said all right well
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.960]   We don't want to give them 30 percent of our downloadable content revenue
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:02.760]   So we're gonna make you side-loaded and instantly there was a problem and there was malware on uh, there was a
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.480]   malicious download instead of the
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:12.680]   Actual download they fixed that after a while of epic said yeah, you know what it's better in the google play store
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.680]   So we're gonna put it in the google play store now that has it stopped epic from also suing google
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.200]   Over the 30 percent big they take on the on the store
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.480]   So
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.120]   They have the same problem with google and google allows what you just said apple should allow
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.600]   So yeah, remember when I said this is multiple issues
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.400]   So one is this idea about whether
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:37.560]   You as the owner of a device should be allowed to decide what to do with it even if the manufacturer doesn't like it
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.000]   And and it's a pretty hard push to say no
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.840]   You should really arrange your your affairs to benefit shareholders right, uh, not yourself
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:55.720]   You owe it to hp to only buy first party ink, right, you know, you should only use k-curid k-cup cups in your in your k-cup coffee machine
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:01.240]   It's consumer hostel. It's customer hostel. It's it's stupid right and and it's offensive
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.280]   And then there's a separate legal question, which is very closely related
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.400]   Which is section 12 one of the digital name copyright act
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.600]   Which is a law that makes it a felony to provide a tool
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.920]   To jailbreak drm
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.000]   And it makes it a felony punishable by five-year prison sentence and a five hundred thousand dollar fine
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.240]   And it does so even when there's no copyright infringement
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.360]   And so this is this is where you start to see how this this
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:30.120]   Attitude of wanting to chicken eyes your customers and the law start to come together
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:36.200]   Because lots of vendors have figured out that if you design a device so that using it in ways that displays shareholders
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.000]   Requires that you bypass drm
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.640]   Then you can have felony contempt of business model right like doing a thing the shareholders don't like
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.320]   In order to do it, you have to break the drm to break the drm you commit a crime
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.720]   Therefore it displeasing the shareholders as a crime
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:55.960]   And that's why you see like abbot labs going after glucose monitors that people with diabetes use
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.960]   To make a closed loop with their with their insulin pumps
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:05.960]   Uh, so that they can they can automatically dose themselves with insulin and abbot labs is like you have to use our solution for that
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.560]   You can't use your solution and of course their solution requires that you buy their
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.840]   Insulin pump too. They're they're like chicken eyes in your organs
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.040]   right and and it's how you see
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.040]   uh
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.720]   Uh, metronic doing this with ventilators, right? There's hundreds of broken ventilators. There's a massive ventilator shortage
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.560]   Uh, they use drm that prevents you from taking a working screen
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.400]   From a dead ventilator and putting it in a working ventilator with a dead screen
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.440]   You need a little tool that synchronizes the two of them
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.120]   It just does a key handshake
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:42.200]   And they won't make that tool available to independent repair people to just buy junk ones on on ebay fix them and get them into hospitals
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:47.560]   To save people's lives and right now the way that those technicians do that job is there's a guy in poland
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.280]   Who did a metronic training course where they gave him a key generator, which he never gave back
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.520]   He embeds it in hardware and puts it in like old guitar pedals
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:02.120]   And mails them to us technicians so that they can fix ventilators and get them back in the marty
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.720]   Right god
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.440]   A kind of stabilization process. It's a deep chickenization involving guitar pedals
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.560]   Speaking as a cyberpunk author. It wasn't a suggestion people. It was a warning
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.760]   Right
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:19.560]   So that's the second issue right like that apple is abusing this that they develop the mechanism for abusing it
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:24.760]   They perfected it and it has spread it's an epidemic in every industry now. It's what's in tractors and cars
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:30.280]   Coffee makers everything but people put up with it. We're happy about it. Why is that?
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.720]   Uh, well, I don't think we are happy with it or say shouldn't be trying to fix their ventilators
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.840]   Yeah, the same people who are benefiting from this the shell shareholders the companies etc
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:46.040]   Are the ones who buy government and the government are the ones who make the rules and if you if you look at even the regulatory
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.480]   regime within the us government, it's all packed with
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:56.280]   Current or former members of the industries. They're supposed to be regulating so it all boils down to money and politics
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.600]   That's where this originates. It doesn't matter if the public likes it or doesn't like it
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.840]   What matters is that the people who make the rules?
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.720]   Depend on the people who benefit from these this kind of chickenization
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.760]   Although I'm going to put myself in the role of the common man here because it's just too overwhelming
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:18.520]   There's so many there's there's so live in a world of crap. Maybe that's why your site is called crap hound gory
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:24.360]   I don't know but we live in a world of crap. I just want to I just want to live my life
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.400]   I don't want to it's too hard to fix all this
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.960]   I just got to suffer with it
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.440]   and uh, so do you think people now need to stand up and get rid of their iPhones and
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.960]   I don't think boycotts like I don't think you can shop your way out of monopoly capitalism
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:43.000]   Right, that's kind of in the it's kind of in the nature of things right?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.440]   It's kind of like saying well, how much of a choice. I mean, I bought the well
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.600]   Linux phone, but that's not really a good alternative
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.520]   No, you're your your alternative is not an individual action
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.600]   The individual action that you need to take is to join a group that agitates for change
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.120]   Right, you need to like the like the question of market concentration
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.280]   Is really on a lot of people's uh radar right now
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.080]   This is like the most it's been since the reagan era that people have been talking about this
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.720]   um, even the right is talking about like, you know, uh, uh, uh, like the
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:24.120]   The feels like we have it feels like carlson being we have bigger problems right now. Well with coven 19
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   We have bigger fish to fry
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.040]   But to a certain extent, it's the same problem is and I think this is what what cori's been been driving at
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   It to a certain extent is the same problem. I mean, it's if you want to get to a core
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:44.600]   Cause it's money in politics if if if the people in congress actually reflected the interests of their constituents
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.840]   Uh, heard one comedian joke that maybe the american public should hire a lobbyist so they'd be representing your language
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:59.480]   Uh, the you know, then it just take the money out of politics and suddenly getting elected would require that you do what your constituents want you to do
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.360]   That would be like a an example of something that would help you with
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:07.240]   Uh, the environment with with with the chickenization process with all of this stuff
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.040]   But that's that's a core core issue that we could do
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.920]   It's just simply voting for candidates who are calling for the removal of money in politics
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:20.040]   Yeah, so I heard oh doc doc couple of times trying to break in there. I want to make sure you go ahead. Oh doctor. Yeah
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.680]   So, I mean, I really don't care about this conversation. Honestly, it's a moot point
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:29.000]   It's it's two things just the money in politics and then term limits
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.800]   I've got people in here telling me that they're gonna save me from donald trump and they've been in office for 40 years
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:39.160]   You didn't save me from bush. You didn't save me with bill clinton. You didn't save me with bush june
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.480]   You're senior like it's all the same sespool. So you got money, right?
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.320]   So take money out and you say look here you get 500 dollars go run your campaign
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.400]   And I have to stay and watch you on youtube every five seconds begging me for five cents change
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.600]   You have your stapler of money that you're allowed to do and you're allowed to have a six or eight-year run
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:01.560]   And that's it you can't do it anymore because what happens is they're in there for 40 years and by chance
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.600]   You get one of them out then they just go work
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.960]   To the company that's gonna come back and lobby the next guy and then get him to take the money because you said oh
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.040]   Well, I came and I don't need the money. Yeah, you do watch. I'm gonna go out here. I'm gonna come back
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.120]   And I'm gonna give you a hundred thousand dollars. You're gonna be like, oh wow free just to try the thing
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.160]   Okay, cool. So you need term limits any money out, but guess what?
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:28.680]   The same asylum is run by the same people and they're not gonna put themselves back in the cell. So
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.240]   Enjoy the conversation
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.160]   Well, look, I mean I have to believe that it's possible for us to have good governance
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.480]   Right like the fact that we're not all dead of listeria
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.280]   And that our roof didn't fall in on us today and that our anti-lock breaking works
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:49.400]   Means that we can actually like have a regulatory conversation about a technical question and come to an answer that is good
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.400]   right and and
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:57.640]   You know like the if you we were talking about pat and medicine before the show right before the fda started to regulate medicine
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.200]   People died all the time from taking crank remedies. It wasn't all just like hey
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.680]   This is cocaine and a suspension of whiskey go nuts
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.080]   It was like this is cocaine mercury and arsenic and a suspension of whiskey
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:16.120]   Why don't you give it to your children, right and we used to you know, there there there was a long run where the fda
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.160]   Had some bad calls, but mostly did the right thing
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.320]   But you know as the industry got a lot more concentrated as you know
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.520]   The number of farmer companies dwindled in the amount of power they had eventually you got stuff like the sakler family
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:34.440]   Cooking, you know, obviously bogus research about the safety of opioids to help mark at oxie cotton
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.480]   Co-opting their regulators
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.400]   kicking off an opioid epidemic that killed more americans than the vietnam war
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.920]   And you know who walked away from it richer than the rocket fellers literally richer than the rocket fellers
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:54.680]   So something did change right and it wasn't just that there was like yet clearly there's more money in politics, especially post citizens united
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   But citizens united arose out of a world in which there was more concentrated industry, right like it's when
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:07.480]   Industry is concentrated you have monopolies monopolies extract monopoly profits monopoly profits allow you to pay your shareholders
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   And still have enough left over to bribe lawmakers
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.360]   Industries that are running a marginal business
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:19.800]   Don't have leftovers to spend on regulatory entrepreneurship because they're trying to scratch out a better living relative to their
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.000]   So is that where we stopped to break down the concentration
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.480]   Yeah
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.960]   Ronald Reagan it was like his signature initiative was that he he brought in this guy Robert bork
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.720]   He was a disgrace nixon lawyer. You may have heard the phrase I got borked
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:39.560]   That that comes from bork being denied a seat on the supreme court because because of his complicity with nixon
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:46.520]   This is the senate wouldn't confirm him and bork was like a speaking as a like a professional fantasy writer bork was a fanticist
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:52.040]   He made up this fake history of how anti-trust law was intended to be operated in america
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:58.520]   Even though the people who actually wrote the statute had debates that got written down where they were like this is what we mean by this
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:06.440]   And what he said is that the only time we should ever use anti-trust law is when a company that does something anti-competitive then immediately raises prices
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:14.120]   And everything else is fair game and bork had like deep pocketed financial backers who are now way richer as a result of that
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:22.040]   And who continue to get richer every year since and every president since reagan has made our anti-trust enforcement weaker
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.680]   And you know it has
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.880]   Become to the point now where you even have people who are the traditional allies of that thinking
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:36.280]   You know like nazis like tucker karleson who are like why can't nazis like me get a fair hearing on social media
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.080]   The industry is too concentrated. We need to break them up
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.920]   You know and i'm not saying first they came for the nazis and i wasn't nazi
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.240]   i'm saying like
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:50.760]   First they came for the trans activists and the pipeline activists and the black lives matter activists
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:56.920]   And all of the other people who i agree with who've been de-platformed from the big social media platforms for forever
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.800]   And we did nothing now they're de-platforming nazis too. It's not time to start cheering
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.960]   It's time to start saying all right
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:09.800]   Finally, let's figure out how to take the power away because the problem with mark zuckerberg is not merely
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.200]   That he's uniquely unqualified to be in charge of the socialize of 2.6 billion people
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.600]   It's that nobody is qualified to be in charge of the socialize is 2.6 billion people
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.840]   Especially mark zuckerberg and and this brings it especially mark
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:29.160]   Yeah, this this is the this is the frustrating thing about all these things. We talked about money in politics being
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:34.520]   uh, you know eroding our democracy or sort of being an end run around our democracy in fact
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.880]   We do have a very well functioning democracy and that's why everybody's going after
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:46.920]   the world view of voters, right? That's why the Russians and the you know the haters and the
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.480]   and the people who want to get rich
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:54.680]   By exploiting the public they're all going after the social media fake news
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:48:01.560]   disinformation thing because they know that actually the people of the United States in this democracy do have the power
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.520]   so let's warp their world view so that they
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.440]   Uh toe the line in the way that we want them to and it's very frustrating and I and I think mark zuckerberg
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:15.000]   Uh, that's a perfect example why mark mark but zuckerberg is not qualified to run
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.520]   Facebook forget about the world just in the United States itself
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.240]   uh, the damage he's done to
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:26.680]   The public discourse of this country is uh is immeasurable
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.400]   I think that's pretty clear. Although
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:34.920]   There's also a case to be made that for instance the george floyd video first surfaced on facebook
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.880]   That these platforms have given a voice
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.680]   to black lives matter to uh, this arab spring that that that there
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.240]   By uh
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:49.080]   Eliminating the gatekeepers there has been some value as well
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.320]   Uh, should we ignore that or how do we how do we get?
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.880]   The the problem isn't like it's like with the iphone right the problem with the iphone
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:04.920]   Isn't that there's an easy way to install software or even an easy way to nominate someone you trust to sort good software from bad software
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.520]   The problem is that you don't have agency
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:12.680]   To change your decision if those people start to act badly
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.240]   Right like that it's a system that only works well. It fails really really badly
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:24.200]   And one of the reasons it fails badly is because they have lock-in and then the other reason it fails badly is because they don't have competition
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.560]   So there's no one else to go to and even if you go somewhere else
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:33.560]   Uh, you know that or even if you want to go somewhere else you can't leave because they've locked you in right?
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:38.520]   Right like when facebook started they had a tool that let you send messages to your myspace friends
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:43.000]   Right it was not a tool that myspace had approved. It was a tool that myspace tried to block
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.040]   But you know it was a little bot you could give it your login credentials
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:50.280]   It would log into myspace and say, you know, hi. I'm leo what mail is waiting for me
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.600]   Let me scrape that and put it in leo's facebook inbox
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.160]   What is in fit leo's facebook outbox? Let's push that out to myspace and they did that
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.160]   because
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.760]   Nobody ever just turns their back on something and walks away from it right?
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:07.400]   That's the problem with like well all the game companies just need to stop selling on the iphone
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:14.920]   It's it's really hard to make those kinds of clean breaks and people when you give them the choice to to kind of oo's
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.360]   out of a system instead of making a complete
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.520]   uh, binary flip from being within to without
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.280]   There it's easier for people to test the waters and make other choices
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.440]   You know my my grandmother was a soviet refugee
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:34.600]   And when she left the soviet union she didn't talk to or have any contact with her family for 15 years
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.800]   Right, it was a hard choice for her to make to leave the soviet union
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.720]   I am a grader from the uk to la five years ago. I got to take my appliances
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.640]   Right. I've got I've got a little um, you know, I've got like a little um, uh, uh,
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:50.840]   Therman over there with uh, with um, you know mains adapter that goes to 240 to to 110
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.840]   So that I could continue to use it
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.520]   We we Skype with my relatives in wales in london every week like
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.160]   You know letting people
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:05.080]   Have have one foot in and one foot out right? I trust apple but not when it comes to fortnite
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.280]   Or i'm a weager and i trust apple but not when it comes to vpn
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.960]   Right
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:13.480]   Right, that's like just saying like throw away your devices and do something new
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.360]   That's a big price to ask people to pay and you're right
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.280]   That they have to get to a point where they're really angry before they're willing to do it
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.400]   Which is why the companies want to raise the switching costs
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:27.480]   Because they know that the higher the switching costs are the worse they can behave. That's right
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:33.960]   Cora you were talking about this the line in antitrust enforcement over the years. I used to write a lot about
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.600]   uh, microsoft and antitrust in the 90s and that was a world
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:44.760]   You know the pc during the 90s you could just reform at your disc and install another operating system
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:49.960]   Uh, it would take you, you know 20 minutes or something like that and they were still
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:56.520]   Uh, they were still basically hammered over bundling a browser with their operating system
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.040]   And so it's like it's like imagine that now. I mean, it's like it's a completely different world
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.920]   So this is getting to the third question about apple
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.120]   So the first question is like are they a good curator?
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:14.840]   The second question is how do they abuse copyright law to lock you in like or the first question is should you have the right to refuse their curation?
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:19.400]   The second is what how do they abuse copyright law to stop you from exercising that right?
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.280]   And then the third one is is what they're doing anti-competitive
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:27.640]   And this is an area where I think we just like people's instincts are just really weird because we um
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.280]   It's been so long since we had
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:35.640]   Pro-competitive regulation that we just kind of forget that there was a moment when like, you know, the u.s
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:41.320]   Government reached into standard oil and said bam you are not standard oil anymore. You're like five companies
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:47.400]   Uh, and these are your conduct remedies. You can't do this that and the other you're no longer allowed to do this other thing
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.760]   You know, we still like we've said this thing called structural separation where we just like reach into all the railroad companies
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:57.560]   Which is the most powerful tech companies in the world and we'd say you're not allowed to have a freight company
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.760]   If you're gonna have rails you can't you can't run freight because then you're competing with the people who are using your rails
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:07.720]   So you're just not allowed like that's what the government says. So you're you're a creature of the government
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.960]   We live in a society of laws the government was democratically elected to keep things that are even keel
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.160]   This is the law
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:19.560]   And so people look at the remedy like with that that epic is asking for right force apple to let epic put it app in the store
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.920]   And they're like how can you force apple to do that? That's just not right
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.680]   And you know, we can argue about whether it's like a good call or a bad call
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.400]   But it is not beyond the pale at all in the american antitrust tradition
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:38.280]   For the us government to reach into a dominant firm and where dominance is defined as having as little as 7% of the market
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.840]   And just say like here's some rules he got to follow
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:45.480]   But they used to have a rule that like if after five years the same company was on the top of the market
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:51.640]   They would automatically open an investigation into them on the assumption that any company that managed to dominate for more than five years
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.320]   Was probably up to no good
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.600]   Right so like we're kind of a fallen civilization in that regard
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:04.360]   Let's take a little break. Corey dr. Oh is here. He's in the house. It's great to have him his next book is coming out in october
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:09.160]   Is there somewhere the kickstarter is not up yet, but at some point no
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:13.080]   Uh, we'll be looking for a kickstarter from uh, Corey
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.600]   So you can participate in the release of this book
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:20.760]   If you read a homeland and uh and little brother, you know, it's going to be
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:26.200]   A great is this a trilogy? Are we going to be uh, it's kind of a trilogy
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.400]   I mean this book stands alone
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:33.160]   I'm going to drop a link to the pre-order for the for the ebook and the print book now if you pre-order it and then send mcmillan
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:38.520]   Your receipt they'll they'll send you an audiobook and an ebook of a original short story. Oh nice
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:43.240]   So i'll drop that into the irc now. Okay, and we'll put that up in the show now. So you can pre-order it straight away. Yeah
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:48.920]   Mike yelgin also uh always a welcome voice of sanity
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:54.840]   Uh elgin.com and of course don't forget his newsletter which mics list which he's done since the year
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.320]   1904 or something forever
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.080]   2000 2000 practically since the previous century almost
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:08.040]   And oh dr. Oh and jj stone who's i've been bought through the apple store. So you're only getting 70
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.520]   Doctor
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:15.400]   We want a hundred percent. I think it's an interesting remedy
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:19.080]   Just say to apple look you got to have uh third party stores
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:25.880]   You got a lot of what somebody's gonna break up the mob sooner or later. I don't think that's a bad that doesn't ruin the iphone
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:32.600]   And even if they just came down and said look if again in the next 10 year or whatever
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.560]   It was gonna drop down. You have to do 20 percent do something right just to make some kind of change
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.360]   Right because I you either way like you said you could flip it either way you want to but something's got to change
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.520]   It is what it is. Yep america. Let's get to these ads. We got paid these bills a collio
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:52.440]   Actually, brought to you by last pass everybody loves last pass everybody uses it here
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:57.320]   We are on the beautiful last pass studios. Wait a minute. You don't use last pass. What are you nuts?
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.000]   What are you crazy?
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.520]   Especially maybe you didn't know maybe use last pass at home
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:08.280]   His last pass premium last pass for families, but you didn't know there was also last pass for business
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:13.640]   Last pass enterprise last pass surveyed global it decision makers
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.920]   Not so long ago and found almost all of them 96 said yeah
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:25.800]   Yeah, having people work from home is definitely impacted our identity and access management strategy in auto
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.040]   You've got people no longer under the safe umbrella of the workplace
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:39.080]   Out out there in the cold cruel world logging into your most precious vital resources your bank accounts your databases your websites
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.760]   you need to be able to
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:45.960]   promote good security behavior while your employees are remote manage identities and most importantly make sure
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:53.720]   The right people are accessing the right resources with last pass you can not only secure password storage
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.840]   By the way employees love last pass they get their own vault
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:03.320]   Store every app and web login in there and it automatically fills it in on the desktop on their mobile devices
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.800]   So it is easy to use
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:11.880]   It's also great for password sharing you don't want employees bad enough employees might write a password on a post-it note
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.120]   And give it to the person across the desk from them now. They're at home. What are they gonna do?
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:22.200]   They're gonna text it email a password. No you want to use the secure password sharing built in the last pass
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.560]   That makes it easy
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:27.640]   You also streamline logins because every credential is captured
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.840]   Anytime you use a new credential create a new password
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   It'll create great passwords for you and then automatically capture it and then fill it so your workflow is smooth is effortless
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:42.040]   And you get to completely control what's going on you can enforce policies
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:47.320]   We do for instance, we require two factor on the master password all our employees have to use two factor
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:52.600]   We have minimum password requirements so they can't use monkey one two three is their master password
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:58.040]   You also get actionable insights into employee password behavior at your admin dashboard
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.600]   So you always know exactly what's going on
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:09.080]   It also makes it really easy to add new employees subtract old employees automate user management by integrating it into your directory system
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.800]   And it's nice to know that
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:18.760]   When as long as user identities are centrally and securely managed you can ensure that the correct employees doing the right thing
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:25.480]   And as the right access and from and you know exactly from where their solutions help businesses improve the employee experience and
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:31.240]   Safeguard from cyber threats doesn't have to be one or the other convenience and security both are possible

[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.920]   Um
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.080]   So sad to see the pad. I just want to make a little program note
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:09.880]   Uh, the passing of Chadwick boseman who was really an incredible actor and the chat room just told me that abc
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.920]   Tonight at eight p.m. Eastern
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:17.400]   Will be broadcasting black panther and its entirety uninterrupted
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.600]   So, uh, that's awesome
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.560]   That's no uncle Leo
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.160]   Anybody who's watching this show anybody was listening to this show
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.120]   Just know that you're not doing anything important in your life
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.200]   Just know that you should be working a little bit harder your life
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:38.760]   This man had cancer for four years didn't say anything to anybody put himself in top physical condition
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:43.320]   Banged out movie after movie after movie and not just movies iconic movies
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:49.400]   Biopics where he's having to take on somebody else's life and their image and he did it with a smile on his face
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.600]   He did it with joy in his heart. He went out here and shook hands and had to deal with people
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:57.800]   Wakanda and him forever into the ground. He still kept a smile on his face. He praised god
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.880]   He praised his co-workers. He didn't know how for the culture and people not of his culture
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.600]   This guy did that with cancer and didn't cry complaints say it words to anybody
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.840]   So I know for a fact that you're not doing enough. I'm not doing enough. I know I felt
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   Sad I don't care about celebrities passing but that man that broke my heart
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.760]   So I just know that I should be doing
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.600]   Three times more than what I'm doing right now because if you could do all that and not play
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.280]   We could all do a little bit more. Let me play a little clip. This is
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.080]   This is Chadwick Bozeman
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.960]   And we didn't know at the time that he was he was very ill with colon cancer as he spoke these words
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.680]   and taylor who
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.600]   um
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.600]   recently passed
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.320]   from cancer
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.520]   and
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.880]   Throughout our filming I was communicating with them
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.040]   um
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.040]   Knowing that they were both terminal
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.160]   and
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.360]   and
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.680]   What they said to me is in their parents said they just they're trying to hold on
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.200]   Till this movie comes
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.480]   and
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.120]   I to a certain degree
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.360]   You hear them say that and you're like
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.520]   like wow
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.200]   that's
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.680]   Like I gotta get up and I gotta get up and go to the gym. I gotta get up and go to work
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.280]   Um
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.000]   You know, I gotta learn these lines. I gotta work on this accident
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.840]   Uh, you know
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.560]   Seeing how devoted all of my cast mates are
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:30.520]   And knowing that that that that will be something meaningful to them
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.720]   But it's to a certain degree that's it's a humbling experience because you like this can't mean that much
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.440]   to them, you know
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.280]   But seeing how
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.280]   the world has taken us on
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.440]   Seeing how the movement is how it's taken all the life of its own
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.400]   I realized that they anticipated
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.040]   something great and um
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.920]   And I think back now to a kid
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.840]   and just
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   you know, uh
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.320]   Waiting for christmas to come waiting for my birthday to come
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.960]   I'm waiting for a toy that was going to
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.160]   That I was going to get a chance to experience or a video game
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.280]   I did live a life waiting for those moments
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.560]   And so it put me back in the mind of being a kid
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.400]   Just just to experience those two little boys
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.960]   um anticipation of this movie
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.600]   And when I found out that they
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:35.640]   Take your time with it
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.120]   He's pretty he's pretty broken up at this point
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:47.000]   And by the way, he was already had a diagnosis of column cancer at this point
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:55.080]   Yeah, it's it's it's it's really uh really something Wakanda forever
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.720]   uh
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.720]   It's a great role model
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.400]   And by the way, the best marvel movie of them all I think
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.040]   My personal opinion
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.000]   Uh, all right. Let's uh, let's move on to something
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.640]   uh, a little uh more
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.360]   topical um
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:21.320]   Can I put a button on the apple thing just one last thing here sure which is which is to say that hard cases make bad law
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.920]   It's you know, like every almost every whistleblower i've ever seen or worked with or followed
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:32.200]   Was not didn't have clean hands right like people don't rat out their boss or their employer
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:38.120]   Just because their employer is shady. It's because their employer shady and they got passed up for a promotion or you know
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:42.360]   Some other thing that made them angry. That's that's what gets people moving and you know
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:48.280]   I see a lot of people in the chat talking about tim swiney and epic and epic running their own game store and not doing the best things
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:54.920]   It's fine. Right like we don't care like if we if we say that we're only going to make good law and saw and and
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:58.040]   write the right kind of decisions when
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.560]   Uh, the people who are arguing for them have clean hands
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:09.080]   Then we're never going to get good decisions because the people with clean hands often can't accumulate the power that it takes to run a campaign like this
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.280]   Yeah
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:16.120]   Yeah, it's the issues not not not tim swiney that we're uh, we're interested meanwhile. There's tick tock
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.000]   Oh, why not?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.760]   Let's go and let's go there too. This is a soap opera that just keeps on giving
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.840]   um
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.080]   Microsoft is now working with walmart on a tick tock deal
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:37.720]   Uh, the the amazing story. I think the backstory of this is very interesting apparently
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:43.320]   Uh, mark zuckerberg was lobbying hard against tick tock for the past month
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:49.960]   Saying you got to do something about this uh, chinese social network and it may well be that zuckerberg influenced
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:56.280]   The president in his ban of tick tock more than the department of commerce or the department of defense
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.160]   um
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.960]   This is this is a very challenging
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:07.000]   Topic because on the one hand I think tick tock is a great creative platform for its users
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   I don't think the information that gets exfiltrated
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.560]   Possibly even to the chinese government by your use of tick tock is particularly
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.040]   dangerous
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.400]   um
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.920]   I you know, I'm not sure exactly what the threat posed by tick tock is and to this date. No one has
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.720]   offered any evidence that they are somehow, uh, you know
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:36.680]   Undermining our great democracy. I'll take a crack at it leo. Yeah. What yeah, what's wrong with tick tock mic
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:42.520]   It's the greatest propaganda platform ever created. Yeah, but so is facebook, right?
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.880]   Uh, well, that's the pro that's that's the problem for for mark zuckerberg is better than facebook
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.440]   Uh at at at propaganda their algorithms are even better and in fact the chinese
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   Communist party the the chinese government
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.320]   Uh, may be putting tick tock on a list of it's almost like a munition
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.600]   Because they don't want an american company get their hands on the algorithmic secret sauce behind
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:11.560]   Tick tock that's the latest news is that china is is added tick tock to its tech export
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.400]   ban
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.320]   Yeah, so it may be an issue of an american company acquires tick tock
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.920]   They they may not get the secret sauce. They won't is what china's saying right in which case it won't be
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.680]   tick tock but I think that there's there's something to be said so we
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.960]   Uh, this conversation in some form or another happens
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:37.480]   Recently on many of uh twit shows and you can't turn that have you
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.320]   I have because it's it's actually one of the most interesting
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:47.000]   Tech topics around and it keeps shifting and morphing and changing and there's a lot to it
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.200]   um, but but the the the the problem
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.840]   with
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.840]   with this is the same problem with
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:07:02.120]   uh facebook and many other things we talk about harassment on twitter abuse, uh, you know disinformation all this stuff boils down to the use of
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.240]   secret algorithms fake algorithms. Yeah, yeah, people different people get different things
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:12.680]   Uh, and nobody can see who's getting what and nobody can get a complete picture
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.080]   And this is causing lots of havoc
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:21.000]   If the if the problem is the dominance of a handful of tech companies
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:25.640]   It seems to me that adding a new social media network would help
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.640]   Well, there's here's one part of the problem is that
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:37.160]   Some social network is going to be the world's dominant social network that that the entire world will
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.400]   Uh use
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.360]   It's not possible for any network except a chinese social network to be the global network
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.200]   Because they ban other social networks facebook is banned twitter is banned
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.560]   The the chinese government bans
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.960]   Non-chinese social networks for use inside china the world's most populous country
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:02.200]   And so in order for any social network to be truly global it has to be a chinese social network
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:07.640]   They've set the rule for that and so there has to be some sort of retaliatory retaliatory
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:12.600]   Action or we just say, you know, we welcome our our insect overlords type of deal
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.960]   Um, and so that that's one that's one reason
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.920]   That's one reason to argue against continued chinese ownership of tick tock
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.320]   but the the other problem is that
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:30.440]   Tick tock has already demonstrated levels of toxicity that arguably are up there with facebook
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:35.560]   Um, for example, they make these subtle little changes where they don't want to show any poverty
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:41.000]   They don't want to show anyone who's overweight. They don't want to show like there's plenty of fat people on tick tock
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.520]   Come on, right they change they change some of it and again. It's it's not
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.800]   Uh, everybody doesn't see the same thing. Everybody sees something different based on their their actions or whatever
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.320]   But the point is that the ability for them to go in and say, you know what?
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:58.360]   We don't want any and they've already done this as well. We don't want anybody talking about Tiananmen Square
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.600]   We don't want any mention of the weekers
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:06.680]   Yeah, of course. Yeah, and if and if and as this social network becomes the main way that
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.400]   People around the entire world interact
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:15.960]   It's another way that the chinese communist party is extending their censorship and control and manipulation
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:20.840]   Of public opinion globally outside the borders of china's bad enough inside china
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.160]   But they're doing it in multiple ways
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:28.280]   They own a dozen radio stations in the united states lots of people don't know this by dance china
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.680]   The chinese government. Oh
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:36.040]   Is playing radio in the united states and you know, maybe we should do something about that instead of tick tock
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:43.000]   Well, I think I think we need to do something about the entire problem of of of not just china
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   But russia and other governments even the united states where a single
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.080]   government can
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:55.640]   Propaganda and shape public opinion globally or in other countries and and I think tick tock is a very very powerful
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.320]   tool
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:03.400]   Potentially for yeah, and then all the I do think that all this stuff about spying and stuff is a bit of a red herring
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:09.000]   It's a bit of a distraction. The real problem is this subtle algorithmically determined
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:17.720]   Ability to shape public opinion in favor of the chinese communist party, which absolutely it's a it's a brilliant tool for doing exactly
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.720]   Oh, and do you tick tock?
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:26.920]   So I don't tick tock, but my daughter tick tocks very very uh, why don't you forbid that
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.440]   Why don't I forbid that because my daughter says she wants to start gaming. I said, okay
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:38.120]   I gave her the tools and the strategies and within a week she went from having zero followers on tick tock to
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.360]   100 000 views and wow
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:45.960]   Thousands followers to like that because it's very simple my algorithmic rhythm works very finely
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.720]   Which you just said just sounds so insane to me and just the general complaint
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:55.560]   So it's okay for americans and nasa and everybody to spy on me, but i'm worried about china not showing fat people
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:02.040]   I see gay transhees he's every pronoun available on tick tock. They're very expressive they talk about
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:08.600]   All kinds of topics that just are censored other places are not even used by the youth, okay
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:14.520]   So the problem is greed mark zucker birds over here running his mouth because it's like oh my god more people are signing up for tick tock
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.800]   How can I fix this? Oh, let me start reels on instagram so I can get some of his money back. That's the problem
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:25.560]   Trump is just a moron and he walks around like a little dog and he bought a whistle and he started jumping
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:31.880]   They went on tick tock they bought up a little fake tickets to his little rally and nobody showed up and he cried when he got off the helicopter
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.000]   What is tie undone? He looked like a bag of junk, okay?
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.320]   So now he's all anti-tick-tock. It's really easy to wind up a dog with a bone
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.840]   Here's my conflict because I know what I agree with what you said mike
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.840]   I also agree with Owen said I feel like tick tock is a really fantastic medium for creation
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.520]   So
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.680]   And I don't think the absence of things about weakers. Yeah, they're not I mean
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:12:00.200]   I don't think the absence of information about weakers or hong kong or tianim and square
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:06.920]   By itself is is a reason to keep I don't agree with you. Oh, and I see a lot of diversity
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:12.840]   On the tick tock hate now on facebook popping up every day. Yeah, ashless groups nazi groups
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.840]   Join now, you know
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.600]   I'm not even gonna say because I don't want anybody to go to it
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:22.360]   But I I saw someone come across my feet today with a very racist website with a guy selling these t-shirts and has
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.000]   Facebook is made
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.200]   People in the group they left that connoceum guard militia page up
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.440]   even after
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.000]   The kid is killing people at the protests
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.520]   Mark Zuckerberg says it was an operational error
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.440]   So of the russians and the chinese and the oh the god
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.640]   I gotta worry about america. Okay, and if kids right here shaking their butt and dancing singing songs
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.800]   It's not really that big a deal to me
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.720]   It's not what they're saying it is because again
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:57.000]   We got people spying on us every which way but lose but i'm supposed to be really upset about what's going on here
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.080]   You're talking about radio stays own
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.240]   China they own property here they probably own like 20 percent of land in america
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.880]   By the way as far as I can tell all the all the radio stations
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.800]   I'm calling in the debt
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:13.400]   All the radio stations owned by the chinese government in the us are in china chinese language right mike. They're not america
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.640]   They're not English. No, no, no, they're they're in english
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:21.480]   They're in english that one of them is in washington dc are are you know people working for government listen to it
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.720]   Uh coming in to work and don't know this is like radio free china is that
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:30.600]   It's it's something along those lines, but but the point is and first of all
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.080]   uh, oh and um
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.320]   There's no way you're more anti-facebook than I am
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.960]   Let's put that out there. I also
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:43.560]   My facebook I just know that everything's trash and I use it importantly to my will to do what I need to get done
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.960]   It's a tool my point my point is my point is that china is a is a geopolitical rival
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:52.280]   That is but has been preparing for decades for a coming
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.520]   Conflict with the united states. They want to make sure that when that conflict comes
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:05.800]   They own the five g routers. They have control over uh, the you know some control over public opinion in the united states
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.680]   They want all these sorts of things. So the the concern about russia and china
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:14.520]   The concern about china
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:19.720]   Is more about the certain coming conflict now what the nature of that conflict is not clear
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.240]   Is it going to be a cyber war is it going to be a hot war is it going to be a whole war?
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.200]   Is it going to be a device we buy from there and they could just turn everything off
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.000]   Everything you know everything i'm looking at on my counter right now this keyboard my phone my monitor
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.080]   This road bike this mouse my air conditioner. It wasn't made here in american
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:40.520]   No, I know why mike just bought 17 acres in uh, washington state fire log cabin
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.920]   Yeah, it's no it's so there are things that
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.720]   Yeah, there are things that that um
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.800]   Like you mentioned a lot of manufacturing china. I think that's going to change a bit
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.800]   I think there's gonna be a lot more mexico, etc
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.840]   But even if it's not I mean the the the ability to implant chips and all that stuff is very limited
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.920]   You can find them if you look for them
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.520]   Things like five g routers and social networks like tick tock
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.880]   These are areas and we have to be really smart about this. I think
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.360]   Where you could throw a switch and change entirely how it works
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.760]   And there's no evidence beforehand
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.440]   That this will happen this is especially true of five g routers you could just suddenly throw a switch and
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:25.000]   And suddenly every five g router is just brought you know grabbing
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:32.440]   Terabytes information per second and shipping back for processing and so on so again. I'm not you know
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.240]   I certainly don't think tick tock is
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:41.320]   Worse or better than facebook they're both awful and in fact to a very large extent tick tock's existence
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.760]   Is a testament to facebook's success because they spent a billion dollars in advertising on facebook
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.840]   And that's where they got where they are today
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.160]   The other part is that they they follow the facebook
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:58.200]   Playbook to the letter which is that you do all these nasty horrible things until you get caught then you apologize and you change
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.440]   So the reason you're seeing the some of the things that I said that they were blocking
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:08.040]   Now on tick tock is because they got caught and they changed it right because they just they just want to
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.280]   They need the market share before they can start really uh doing all this stuff
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:16.120]   But again, I my only point is that the problem with tick knock
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:22.440]   Don't let the politics confuse you the problem with with with tick tock is not spying
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.080]   It's information warfare
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   And the potential for for for that to to work against
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:35.240]   US interest that's all kori doctor. Oh, can I yeah? I I wanted to jump in because I I think that like uh
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.040]   There are ways in which I I vigorously agree with both of you and some in which which I disagree
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.240]   But I I also think that I can suggest maybe a way through that that we could all be happy with so, you know
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.280]   Oh, and I I completely agree that like there is not one bad thing in the world with
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:55.160]   Kids doing creative stuff on tick tock. I have a 12 year old who uses tick tock
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.240]   I worry a lot about the privacy dimension
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:03.480]   But I cannot deny that the kind of remix culture that she's doing is the stuff that i've championed for my whole professional life
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   And it warms my heart to see or do it
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:10.680]   Um, I'm also not going to say that you know the parts of facebook that work right the
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:14.600]   Communities of people with rare diseases who lend support to one another
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:21.400]   The people who form positive social movements there the families that are you know spread out around the world who can stay in touch that way
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:26.280]   That there's something wrong with that. The problem is the lack of self-determination
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.960]   Right, it's it's that you can't use tick tock without having your data non-consensually harvested
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.960]   And the reason for that is we don't have a federal privacy statute with a private right of action
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.640]   And the reason for that is that every time it's come up facebook and google have killed it
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   Is the california
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.800]   Privacy california's got a pretty good one. Yeah
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.760]   Yeah, so we'll see if that actually starts to discipline it because as we saw with with california
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:53.560]   Automotive laws the whole nation changed the way that it's right cars once california started changing
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.640]   It's a big enough economy that if california says you can't do it that might be enough
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.960]   And you know, I also worry about things like
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.840]   information security
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.800]   warfare
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:06.920]   in
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.880]   using
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.920]   Technological our technological infrastructure telecoms infrastructure
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:14.360]   And I think that we should worry both about deliberately design defects
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:20.360]   The the kind of thing you're talking about implants and so on and also accidental defects that get exploited when you look at nsa
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:25.800]   And the leaks that snoting did you know they spent a quarter million dollars a year on a thing called
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:31.640]   Bull run which was actually creating new defects in software, you know sabotaging elliptic curve
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.920]   At nist and so on but most of what they did was just identify zero days, right?
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.680]   Not defects that the chinese government had put in 5g routers
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.720]   Defects that were the result of like the halting state problem and the fact that we cannot
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.280]   Ever demonstrate that software is perfect
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.600]   All we can demonstrate is that no one has figured out where the imperfections are yet
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.920]   And so for that we could have a bunch of rules that are common sense rules, right?
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:00.920]   If you build a hospital today and you say i'm going to put in a 15 story atrium
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:06.120]   But i'm not going to tell you what math i'm using to figure out why it doesn't fall in and kill everyone in the hospital
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.720]   We'd say get the hell out of here you are required to show your work
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:15.560]   If you're doing civil engineering well as we saw during the ransomware epidemic if you take all the computers out of a hospital
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:22.760]   It becomes a morgue every bit as it does if the ceiling falls in and yet you can install computers and hospitals without ever telling anyone
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:29.080]   How they work in fact you get rights of action as a manufacturer to sue people who describe how that equipment works
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.600]   We should not have a single telecom switch in use in this country
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:40.200]   whose source code is an escrowed whose dies aren't available for for public inspection that that isn't subject to random inspections
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:47.160]   The same way that we don't have a bridge in this country who's uh, who's who's you know concrete and aggregate mix is a trade secret
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.640]   You know the fact that it will make it harder for some firms to make money is neither here nor there
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.800]   We should not be relying on secret math to decide whether we live or die
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:02.280]   So, you know get a private rate of action allow interoperability so people can use tick-tock and other services through
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:08.040]   Uh third party services that they trust so they can they can proxy them and and not expose their data
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.600]   Allow that kind of robust marketplace that was once characteristic of tech
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:17.720]   And a lot of the problems we're worried about go away pretty quickly or at least have a chance of being mitigated
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   The the second issue about information warfare i'm worried about information warfare
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.880]   But I think it's primarily a monopoly problem and not a manipulation problem
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:31.400]   I think that you know is the book that i've just that i've just published this week the surveillance capitalism book on one zero
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:38.280]   This is so good. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Yeah, it takes aim at this this idea that algorithms are really good at persuading us
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.960]   And it notes that you know the actual like science on this is not great
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:45.240]   You know the big five personality type science doesn't replicate
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:54.280]   Expression detection doesn't replicate that giant facebook voter manipulation study where they subject to 20 million people to uh get out the vote messages
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.760]   Saw an effect size of 0.4
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.640]   percent
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.280]   Now, yeah, like some elections are close enough that 0.4
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:07.160]   Matters, but you know like it's not mind control and everyone who's ever claimed that they had mind control turned out to be lying
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:13.800]   That was kind of on the other show shana needed that final point she did because otherwise so what?
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:20.280]   Yeah, well, otherwise it's monopolies and she doesn't she doesn't want to call it monopolies because she's a business school professor
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:27.720]   And she wants to say that capitalism mostly works and that tech is a rogue capitalism that has figured out how to how to take away our right to choose
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:34.280]   Right, but you know like being able to be the only place where people get their information is a really good way to change what they believe
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:39.000]   But if someone already knows something and you can show them a bunch of other information
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.320]   It's really hard to change their minds, right? Like, you know, it look at look at gerbils
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:49.960]   Who probably had the best information control of any dictator in our history who had mandatory three-hour radio
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:57.880]   National radio broadcasts about Nazism that were aimed at convincing people that Nazism was the one true ideology and five years after the
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:02.120]   The bunker was was taken over in burlin fell
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:07.640]   Most people had repudiated Nazism and it wasn't through like deep programming exercises
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:12.680]   It was through like truth and reconciliation trials. So, you know, like you can get people to do stuff
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:17.560]   You can terrorize them into doing it. You can get distracted people to not really understand what's going on
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.120]   But i'm less worried about this information warfare
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.000]   But even if even if we should be worried about information warfare
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.640]   The the way to solve it is not to stop people from talking to each other
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:32.120]   It's to give them control over the media that they use where they talk to each other
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.520]   But it's free so you can't have control
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.800]   You're not paying me to use tiktok or facebook or twitter if you'd like to pay me three dollars a month
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.880]   I'll give you all the privacy you want
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.360]   And I don't I don't buy it
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:49.000]   Every weager who used an iphone spent a thousand bucks on their iphone and apple sold them out, right?
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.960]   Every farmer has spent 600 thousand dollars and a jondere tractor can't fix it even though they bought it
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.800]   Right, like if you're not paying for the product or the product works under conditions of competition
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:02.280]   But under monopoly, I don't care if you're paying for the product. How about cash in both ways
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.360]   Why not why not do both take your money and spy on you
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.480]   Yeah, why not what's gonna stop me?
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:14.680]   What is so this is by the way everybody should read this. It's a fairly long piece. It's actually a whole book
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:23.160]   Uh, it's uh, it's a free for reading at uh, one zero dot medium dot com how to destroy surveillance capitalism
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.000]   and
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.800]   I haven't finished it because I only discovered this morning. So
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.680]   I read as much as I could over my coffee, but
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.200]   Essentially the idea is the concentration of power
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:37.080]   In these handful of companies is really the issue
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.840]   And if if you can diversity is your friend
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.480]   in effect
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.080]   Yes
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:49.800]   Yeah, yeah, that's right that like it's just that you know like conspiracies are hard
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:55.560]   Because there's a collective action problem, right? Like here's four of us trying to agree on one thing
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.640]   We can't we're struggling right? Yeah
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.600]   Like what if there's a hundred companies in a sector
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.800]   Someone's always gonna why is q and on why is q and q and on as an example?
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:12.680]   So persuasive and has done so well it really looks like without facebook q and on might not have the look
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.760]   We've always had conspiracy theories
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:17.800]   Uh from the very first days of our country, but
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:23.560]   Without facebook q and on wouldn't have the spread and the currency and the power it has right
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.560]   So I think that like just like we can sometimes well
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.400]   Every issue is easier to explore with the simplest case and then we can work to the complicated case
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.240]   So let's just start with the flat earth
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:38.840]   Okay, because the flat earth is not a conspiracy anyone should believe in 2020 and yet it's on the rise, right?
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.280]   There's never been a moment at which like flat eartherism
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.120]   Was a harder sell as you point out in the article
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:51.400]   You could put a go pro on a balloon and go high enough to see the curvature of the earth
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.760]   It's middle school classes around america did that last year before the lockdown. Yeah, right? So
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:02.040]   And and yet it's on the rise and when you look at what the underlying theory of the flat earth is
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.600]   It's not merely that the earth is flat
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.320]   That's actually the secondary part of the flat earth theory
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:11.800]   The primary part of the theory is that you can't trust authorities because they are so they are captured
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:17.560]   And they're in it for themselves and they're lying to us and they lie whenever it's convenient for them
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:24.440]   Uh and pocket the money. Well, that's the central tenant of adyvaxxers. That's the central tenant of all of these right?
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.040]   Absolutely. You cannot trust authority. Everyone on this program has already said
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:34.200]   Themselves so we probably like we don't disagree on this, you know, most people I think agree on this point
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.000]   But the problem is that in a very high tech world
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.840]   You cannot answer all the technical questions for yourself, right?
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:47.240]   Like even if you go and figure out whether or not you can trust the regulation that determine the structural integrity of your ceiling
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:52.120]   Can you then go and get a microbiology degree and decide whether or not you trust vaccine science?
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:56.040]   And when you're done with that, can you figure out whether the 737 max is safe to fly?
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:00.200]   Right, we have to delegate our trust to neutral adjudicators
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:06.440]   Regulators and the regulators have become less and less trustworthy over time and it's made us
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:11.000]   Uh prone to believing theories that start from the premise
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.280]   That the truth. Yeah, you can't trust the process by which the truth is known
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.240]   Right and so what you have to do is find someone who sounds like they know what they're talking about and get them
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:26.040]   To sort the truth from the false and so it's flatter. There's they're all over this
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.320]   Yeah, so it's I mean one way to look at this because I know some people I think we all do who
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.040]   Are conspiracy oriented and so on you know that feeling you have when
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:45.480]   You were informed that the consensus was xyz and then you you believe that because it was the consensus because the experts said it was true
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.440]   And and and so on that that is probably true that feeling that's a field
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.120]   That's the personality trait that most people have
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.720]   And likewise the opposite exists as a personality trait
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:02.440]   If the conventional wisdom is x x cannot possibly be true
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.280]   Like that that's where a lot of people start and that's what drives
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.160]   The conspiracy theories the flat earthers the reading of the national choir and so on
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.600]   And those probably I think that's probably true, but it doesn't explain why there's more of them
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.240]   Right. Unless we underwent a genetic shift
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.600]   I don't you know, there is more of them something in the water
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.120]   I think they're vocal more vocal now
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:27.960]   There used to be a source of shame to to to say that you believe certain things and
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:34.200]   Because because the the sources of information the you know the nine o'clock news or whatever it was
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:40.120]   Uh didn't tote a line, but nowadays you can find like-minded people on facebook groups
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.440]   And you can just really indulge these things and also learn by the way learn about more
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.480]   I was I was uh and facebook adds to this
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.680]   actively, I mean a recent uh report and I'm sorry. I don't have the details
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.360]   um
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:01.480]   In front of me, but recent reports showed that the majority of people who went down rabbit holes or went to conspiracy
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.720]   Groups
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.840]   Did so because facebook actually recommended them
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:12.120]   Sure, you know, and I think it doesn't tell you why they believed it. I'm sorry. Go ahead
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.960]   It's just the same thing of how everything works right now
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.600]   the social networks of the world and just
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.600]   the media of the world when kyrie Irving a basketball player says
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.240]   the world is flat
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.120]   and
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:32.520]   He's got a huge audience not just social media just in tv in networking. He sells shoes. So
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:35.000]   Kids listen to him and they're like, oh
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.240]   My hero said the earth is flat and he had to go and apologize because he had like 2 000 teachers like bro
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:45.080]   I got six year olds seven year olds coming to tell him he'd you said world flat
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.600]   And i'm trying to teach him in school because he shut up and he had to backtrack it
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:51.640]   So did he believe the world was flat or he just said it
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:57.560]   The way he said it he believed it he only backtracked because he got destroyed
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:02.440]   on social on he got destroyed the world the media had ripped him everybody ripped him
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:06.600]   But teachers were coming at him and droves on all his social platforms
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:13.320]   So he walked that back had to do an interview and explain himself and just saying, you know, I'm just I meant just to say to open your mind
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.320]   to possibilities
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.200]   Possibility of the world being flat
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.640]   educated guy
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:28.120]   Who has millions of dollars who has million why why do more people believe why why why are we so vulnerable to this today?
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:31.160]   Because it's a site
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.560]   Finish a doctor and then i'll call you next you're next
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.320]   I know
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.200]   Yeah, ever because it's a conversation I have all the time
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.800]   I was talking last week about a guy who told me that it's okay that amazon doesn't pay there for your taxes
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.360]   That apple doesn't pay there for your taxes and I said
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.680]   So you make $27,000 a year. I know you're broke
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.200]   And you're here defending to what these billionaires make and what they don't pay out
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.760]   Tell me the good that they're doing with the tax minute. They're saving you've got to pay your taxes
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:04.680]   Which a little measly check but you're going to go and defend them like you went to school learn nothing average education
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:10.360]   But you're now defending rich people because marketing branding and putting to your mind the things that you hear
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:16.200]   You'll go out there and go defend anybody because you love your iphone because you love two-day prime
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.680]   And you think that they innovated the world on shipping. I'm like bro. They had two-day shipping since the 70s
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:25.400]   You're on the team. You've been it. That's a because that's a team sport now. It's a lot easier to say
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:28.200]   Well, i'm on team apple or i'm on yep team amazon
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:34.520]   So whatever they do and we see a lot of that in politics i'm on team republican or i'm on team democrat
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.520]   Whatever they do that's right
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:41.560]   But why it's only true that we that we take some identity from these beliefs
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:47.080]   But it doesn't it doesn't explain why we what we used to have that fill that void like that the
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:54.120]   Why it is we feel so alienated why it is we're so in dire need of of these alternative explanations
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:59.080]   Anna merlin wrote a really good book last year called republic of lies that's
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:04.040]   ethnographies of conspiracists and and uh kind of social theory of conspiracism
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:07.000]   And you know one of the things that she talks about is that
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.560]   Being a conspiracist is hard work, right?
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.160]   We tend to think of it as being very lazy like how could you believe the earth is flat?
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.680]   Everyone knows it's round well to maintain a belief in the flat earth
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:25.320]   You have to do a lot of reading about bogus science right to like anti-vaxxers are not people who are lazy
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:29.560]   They're people who are lavishly wrong like wrong in this very detailed
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:36.120]   energetic way that requires a heroic effort to keep up and
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.640]   One of the things that merlin says is that it's not enough
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:47.400]   For you to distrust authority for you to become a conspiracist that the the cocktail that makes
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:54.680]   Conspiricism is both a distrust of authority and trauma resulting from bad authority actions
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.080]   Right from from the authorities doing something bad
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:02.120]   So, you know, we know a lot like people know a lot about aerospace conspiracies in the ufo world
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:06.040]   And aerospace is full of like actual conspiracies not imaginary ones
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:10.600]   But ones were like there was that time they accidentally dropped a nuclear bomb on the midwest
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:15.240]   It didn't tell anyone about it until they got busted for it because it fell out of a usaf
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:21.000]   airplane, right like people who have been directly traumatized by the opioid epidemic
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:26.040]   Find it very easy and compelling to believe anti-vaxx because the anti-vaxx story is
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.440]   Pharma companies don't care if they kill you
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:32.840]   The regulators aren't keeping them honest the science behind it is junk
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:40.200]   Um, and you can't trust anything that anyone tells you about health like that part's not wrong
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:45.560]   And you know, I think that all of us who are down on conspiracism and I include myself
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.240]   Need to
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:51.000]   Ask yourself what you are going to do when you rub up against something like this
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.840]   Right like when say the cdc who I think most of us trust most of the time
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.560]   Suddenly turns around and says well
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:02.280]   We've decided to go with the department of health and human services recommendation and nobody should get tested
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:08.120]   Uh, merely because they came into contact with some with covid by the way that also supports the president's agenda
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.200]   But that's totally not why we're doing it, right?
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:15.880]   Like what do we do we become conspiracist then like how do we then sort the next claim the cdc makes
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.040]   Right from this existing one
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.440]   Just to be cleared
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.080]   Did a bomb fall in the midwest? Yeah, there was a nuke that there was a there was a broken arrow in the west
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:28.760]   I forgot what it's supposed to explode though, right? No, but they dropped a nuke. Okay
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.520]   Yeah
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:35.720]   They lost they lost a bomb over the midwest. We lost one of our bombs is missing. That's okay. That's not so good
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.480]   Yeah, I've mentioned that was that
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.480]   Epidemic and brought it into the
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.920]   Hood in america
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:43.640]   Just gave it the black people's flag. If we call it crack
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.520]   Well, you know, I mean, you know, if you look at like so mr
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.080]   Lin has a whole chapter on um katrina levi
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.400]   Conspiracies right the belief that the levies were dynamited in in katrina
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.960]   Which is a widely held belief among some people interesting. I don't think it's it's true
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:03.240]   But I but I think it could be true and the reason I think it could be true is because in 1928
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:08.040]   They did dynamite the levies in Tupelo to drown black neighborhoods in spare white neighborhoods
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.920]   Right, so like it's a thing that actually high up all the property and so it which is what they did
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.440]   They went down there. They bought up all the people's property for like two dollars
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.880]   That's the only place they had to live. They displaced people all over the country
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:24.200]   They got they sat there. They dropped a bomb in phil del phio and some guys in 1985
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:27.080]   Nobody went to jail for the septo only survivor in the bombing
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:28.600]   Uh, the tisty gairman
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.560]   Oh, they would never do that to america people the people to fall for this country in their nation the government loves you
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.880]   So again, i'm not anti-conspiracy because sometimes i'm such a my
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.560]   Matter of stuff like the spears. Yeah, I got like a list of like 12. Yeah, that's not real
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.120]   They don't do that, you know if I heard one more person
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.680]   Tell me I never thought that a police officer would do that and i've been telling you this since I was 10 years old
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.080]   But now we got camera phones so you see it now you have to believe it because you're looking right at it
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.400]   So I mean some conspiracy theories
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.840]   They're not all from russia. Some of them are just good old aficion american history
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:09.000]   I think trauma is a good word because it's not merely the trauma of being lied to by
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.960]   Authority or being misled by authority. It's true
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:19.160]   There's a lot there's a lot of trauma in just in general these days and that combined that
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:27.080]   You know, that's the goal of propaganda is not to make you believe something but make you not believe anything
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:34.360]   and I think that's right. Yeah, well that that certainly the the um the the aim of of
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:40.680]   Russian desert from matt cia, I think it's called which was developed by the so union and the kgb
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:45.240]   And the during the co-war which is now in full force and it's deliberately to make you
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:49.880]   Distrust all sorts of information. I also think that their conspiracy
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:55.720]   Thinking comes from the fact that our lived experience gives us a world view
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:59.880]   And there are many things that are below that world view where we don't believe
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:04.040]   That something could be that evil or something could be that great
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.640]   So one example would be lots of people don't believe in the moon landing
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:15.640]   Because that's a level of greatness and achievement that is so great that it's so far beyond what people could imagine as possible
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.560]   That they just say can't be yeah
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:22.360]   I'm gonna believe that it was has done in a hollywood studio or whatever and then and then the you know
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.480]   Black people have been telling everyone else for decades
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.200]   About how the police treat them
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:35.160]   With a lot of violence of trampling the rights and so on and I think a lot of people there's a lot of racism behind that
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:42.280]   But there's also a lot of people who just couldn't believe that couldn't because of their lived experience at that level of evil that sort of
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:45.000]   Darkness existed all around them
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.160]   uh, and and so
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.080]   You know, I actually think
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:55.320]   This is one case in which ubiquitous video technology personal technology is actually shattering
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.640]   uh, something that people couldn't bring themselves to believe in the past and
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:05.560]   Uh, unfortunately, that's not going to work for the space program, but again. I think people have a I lived experience
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.480]   that
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.640]   Doesn't allow them to believe things that are that far outside of their lived experience
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:16.440]   Well, and you know if you if you've ever worked with someone who got called
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.480]   All that as a sexual abuser
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.360]   And you you may have found that they were very good to you, right that like oftentimes
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.920]   As a man when I when I when when other men get out it as being sexual abusers by women
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.760]   I trust and who I believe
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:34.840]   The the thing is that they have never displayed abusive behavior in my presence
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.280]   because
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:41.560]   They knew that if they did there would be some social consequence because of our relative social power
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.200]   and so they can find their bad acts to
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.880]   um
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:50.200]   Only doing it in the presence of people who wouldn't be believed and I think that there's a strong analysis
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.400]   of technology
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:57.160]   to the conduct of police around high status and low status people that that they are respectful and
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:02.920]   Generally good to higher status people and there's you know, it is the combination of
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:10.840]   Systemic disbelieving and and erasure of other people's experience and as you say your lived experience of never never seeing it in person
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:17.080]   Harvey Weinstein was a perfect gentleman to me. Yeah, right, right
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.000]   Uh, let's take a little break. What a panel. Well, I'm so thrilled to have all three of you here

[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:52.680]   You know it's funny until I saw the watchmen. I had no idea about the greenwood massacre. That's it's just an amazing story
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:59.160]   Uh, and uh, thank goodness the watchman kind of brought it to light for a lot of people and now it's well worth learning
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.160]   It's and again talk about conspiracy. I live in the northeast area
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.280]   Obviously and people would talk about it and people say that's impossible that can't happen right like
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:14.040]   Again, I'm like how could that happen? They they brushed it under they swept it under the news like they covered it up
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.000]   Yep
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.520]   And again, they locked up the only survivor in jail so she couldn't talk to anybody. Yeah, so you know some some conspiracy theories like you when you say it out loud
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:28.440]   So the police bombed the whole block and killed they wouldn't do that. How can they get away with that?
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.560]   Sounds so preposterous when you say it out loud, but you're like, oh, yeah, they did that and it so
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:40.200]   And that boldens other people's crazy conspiracies. Well, yeah, the world is flat because they bombed Philadelphia. I believe world flat
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.880]   So and and let's not forget that was 35 years ago
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:50.280]   You know, yeah, uh, this is not this is not recent. It's been going on for a long time. Yeah
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.800]   Thank you, doctor always a thrill to have you on to our show today
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:00.360]   Uh brought to you by our friends at monday.com nowadays
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.720]   When your team is distributed all over the place
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:07.640]   It's hard to keep everybody on track to know where people are working
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:11.560]   You can't have the stand up meetings you might have had when everybody was in the office
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.720]   But you know, I prefer monday.com. This is one of those habits. That's going to last
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:21.960]   After we come back to work. It is incredible. Let's teams plan manage and track work
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:25.000]   In one centralized website
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.640]   One single source of truth where everybody can go
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.920]   I want to say right up front though. You don't have to abandon your existing tools because
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:39.000]   monday.com has no code automations that will bring all of your workflow into monday.com
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.960]   Whether you're using zoom slack email calendar spreadsheets google docs, whatever it is you use
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:49.720]   You continue to use but monday.com makes effective teamwork possible by bringing all of that
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:54.120]   Into one single place whether your team is five people are 5 000

[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:10.280]   What their progress is what their status is and depending on how you like to look at it
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.560]   You can have a gantt chart or a timeline you can add can band board
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.400]   You can have tables like spreadsheets. You can have it look exactly like you want
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:22.040]   They have ready-made templates for every situation including remote work

[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:38.200]   I wish we'd had this when I was in high school
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.280]   I guess in this and the had you know you have to do a team to do the science project
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:47.720]   And you know there's always one person on the team is yeah. Yeah, I'm working on that. I'm working on the if we'd had money.com
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.960]   I would know he's not working on it
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:54.520]   About to get working on that monday.com
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:44:02.120]   Slash to it. We thank him so much. I wish monday.com would like buy zoom and make it more official. Oh, I wish somebody buy zoom
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.960]   I swear
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.880]   It's hard to live in zoom in zoom land. We're all living there now
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:11.880]   Uh leo I would have thought you'd be unnatural for this
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:17.080]   I mean like you know as I try to cope with being on camera for seven hours a day or whatever
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:19.160]   I'm like, this is what it must feel like to be leo
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:22.760]   Yeah, I guess it is
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:25.320]   You know there's something different. I don't know what it is
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:30.360]   Well, I have some theories, but what i'm doing right now what we're doing right now is a little different
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:36.120]   Than trying to be on a zoom call where you're sitting at your desk at your computer. The screen is right there
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:42.120]   You got 10 people there there it's you it's like working through murk. I don't know why it's
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:49.800]   You think right and and yet I get zoom exhaustion just like anybody else give me a couple hours in a zoom call and I just want to die
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:54.840]   I just I've yet to be on a zoom call and i'm trying to make it the rest of my life without doing so
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:59.640]   Oh my god, you're my hair. How do you do that? Yeah, I do audio call-ins
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:02.840]   I refuse to get on zoom and I just want to one with somebody else type
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:07.240]   I don't even care somebody records a conversation so it's gonna be later. I haven't opened it up yet
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.480]   Is your daughter
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:16.440]   Going to classes. She must be doing zoom school, right? So let me let me tell you something my daughter like if you ask her
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:22.680]   And she's been captain. We're not going anywhere dad. We're not doing anything. You know, I mean coval good. Yeah, well, good
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:29.240]   She wants to protect you. She's not protecting herself. She's protecting you. Oh, and definitely i'm overweight national treasure
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:33.080]   And I must be protected at all costs, but if you ask her like
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:41.000]   Ask her last podcast like do you want to go back to school? She's visceral about wanting to be back in the classroom because of course a lot of the teachers took it
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.800]   I mean, it seems to be great people. But all that good stuff
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.160]   But a lot of teachers took it as a vacation to where they just didn't want to do their job
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:51.080]   They're sitting at home in their robes and they're not helping kids. I have to say though
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.080]   Go ask another kid
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:57.320]   I have to say like they weren't doing their job. My daughter is one of those people that
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.800]   Needs to be shown something. She's not right
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.160]   She doesn't learn mostly by reading. She understands by different layers of education. But I
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:13.640]   I was a nightmare. I do want to give credit because there are teachers who are taking this as an opportunity to rise to the occasion and are doing amazing
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:21.240]   Work and my son who's a senior in high school has had some really engaged teachers who've really and some terrible ones
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:27.560]   But some really engaged teachers and I get calls on the radio show. I got a couple today from teachers who are really one is a
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.080]   Teachers the introductory psychology course at Cornell
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.240]   And he says I feel so bad for these kids because
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:40.920]   They're paying 50 grand a year for a college education. Yeah, and they're in their jammies at home
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:47.560]   And so he is he's spending his own money really trying to make this an engaging
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:52.920]   He's got 700 kids in that introduction to psychology course at Cornell
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.320]   And like I said, teachers are the greatest blah blah blah blah
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.600]   Like she had a math teacher her math teacher went above and beyond to help her
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:04.440]   So it is an individual basis thing. That's why I said like that some are teachers in general. Yep all deserve a raise
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:10.200]   Well, and very and no teacher has received any training right this area
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:15.080]   Right. That's not what they signed up for right. I mean, uh, as you know, leo, uh, kevin has chatterbox
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.440]   He's been doing like chatterbox camps. So he's essentially been a school teacher for all these kids who were out of school
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:24.120]   For a limited period of time and keeping all these kids engaging
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:28.760]   But his whole his whole product is something that's hands-on and lends itself to that
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:34.360]   You throw teachers into a scenario where they're supposed to be teaching science math this that the other thing they just don't
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:39.800]   It's it's a rare quality to be able to function in this entirely different world
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:45.160]   When you've been trained and your experience is a stand in front of class interact face to face
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:48.920]   It's so different and it's such a problem for so many students
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.880]   Don't make it easy either. I've seen I've seen kids get rowdy on a teacher where the teacher
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:58.760]   The teacher I still understand that plus it's hard for a kid
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:02.760]   Or even a college student to keep focused
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:10.200]   During this process right you're at home. How's your daughter doing? Cory? Is she is she going to school online? What's she doing? She's yeah?
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:13.080]   I mean burbank was smart. They they
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:18.600]   You know briefly mooted half days and then as soon as our caseloads sort of go up there like forget it
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:21.560]   Everyone's learning from home. She goes to a title nine school
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.920]   So there was an issue about whether they could do all distance ed because you know, they're not allowed to require
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:32.520]   That parents buy additional equipment, but they were able to locate some some extra computers
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:39.480]   We we rehabilitated like four chrome books and a couple of purism laptops and stuck chrome OS on them and brought them down there and
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.640]   And got them to other families as well. But you know, it's been okay. It's pretty it's just started
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.040]   The stuff that I'm much more worried about is college age kids who are being proctored
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:55.560]   And being forced to do these high stakes exams using this proctoring software that's basically spyware
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.560]   Right, and it's there's so many terrible issues like some of them allow you to
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.600]   Record a panorama of the students work environments you've got like students who are
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:12.440]   Maybe living in one room apartments with their parents and their parents privacy is being compromised or small children's privacy is being compromised this way
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:18.840]   And then you know, like i'm not a real teacher. I I sometimes teach and i've like got these, you know, honorary teaching appointments
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:25.080]   But my parents both have PhDs and education and no one who is a real teacher believes in high stakes testing
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:32.440]   High-staste testing it's only pedagogical purpose is to allow us to pretend that people have money to pay for test prep or smart
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.840]   Right, it's a way to pretend that we have a meritocracy
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:37.960]   spell pedagogical
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:40.040]   Teachers
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:44.920]   Teaching good i got i got i'm trying to google it. He's an expert in teaching
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:49.160]   I related to education had a god like related to learning. Okay, all right
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:52.120]   Thanks for the definition because i was going to google it but i really couldn't spell it
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:50:00.120]   No, you're good. So i had like this. It's just like karae karae likes to use this karae likes to use this sesquipidalian words don't don't don't fall for it
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:03.240]   They're perfectly chromium
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.800]   Sesquipidalian entirely
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.920]   but you know like that
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:12.600]   There you so you've got this like double tragedy right where we're you know
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:18.280]   There's no reason for them to be doing these tests and then in order to do the tests you subject them to these incredible indignities
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.040]   and so
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:28.120]   There's like just no reason for it at all and some of the companies that do this stuff are not the kind of companies you want to trust with spyware for your kids computer
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:33.080]   Proctorio there's their cOO. I believe or maybe ceo docked
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:37.880]   A student in a reddit forum who was complaining about the software and he was like well
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:41.400]   I think you'll find that what you said in your private chat to our support people was different
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:43.880]   He said it in with his
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:48.920]   Like great dude. You are the person i trust to be installing root kits on every computer in america
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:56.360]   I mean like you know we're worried about tick tock and the ccp having insight into kids devices and these guys are just sociopaths
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:01.160]   Well, let me give you a plug mike actually your son
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:06.520]   A plug because uh chatterbox is really awesome and they have a whole section
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:09.160]   for educators
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:14.120]   So this is this is uh, this is to it's a privacy focused
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.520]   voice assistant
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:19.480]   That really and the kids build which is awesome
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:23.400]   Yeah, it's like an amazon echo except you build it yourself
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:28.280]   So you understand what the parts are and what goes into it and then it's a hundred percent private
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:33.480]   And secure and then the best part during this pandemic lockdown
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.600]   Is that building the skill doesn't do anything until kids teach it what to do and it can do
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:40.920]   Far more than an amazon echo can do
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:46.440]   Yeah, but they have to teach each individual thing and doing so they learn about language they learn about programming learn about all this stuff
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.440]   it's and and
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:51.160]   It's an infinite source of creative
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:55.640]   activity during a lockdown so there are lots of kids using chatterbox right now
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:00.920]   Who who are using it six eight hours a day because they love it so much they're having so much fun
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:03.640]   Day after day. There's just an endless
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:08.440]   Number of things you can do with it. So it's it's really a fantastic creative tool that really does
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:14.360]   Prepare kids of it for the future because in the future we're going to be interacting with computers through voice
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:19.320]   And so this teaches kids exactly how that works how apis work etc
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:23.960]   So it's it's really doing some a whole bunch of kids a lot of good right now during the lockdown
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:29.480]   And I love it that uh, it's kevin and his wife nadia who are the
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:33.960]   founders and nadia's the brand matador and princess squishy face
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:40.520]   Your three-year-old granddaughter is the that's right. It's the real-life chatterbox behind the chatterbox
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:46.280]   That's really really awesome the youngest chatterbox user. Isn't that cute? Isn't that sweet? It is. Yeah
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:53.480]   Uh, yeah, my it's a tough time right now for everybody and you know, I um our our 17-year-old is kind of going
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:58.360]   a little stir crazy uh stuck with me and his mom
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:04.200]   And uh, you know, I just I just say we're all suffering not this isn't good for anybody
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.360]   And it's just a tight tough time
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:10.440]   But we will make it through. I've been really enjoying I mentioned this before reading
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:19.800]   The uh, the splendid in the vial which is eric larsons latest book about the bombing of uh, london the battle of britain
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:26.360]   And how they went through uh an equal a more tough probably tougher time really, uh, and could you imagine?
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.640]   Yeah, and uh, and I've just I read it intentionally during
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.160]   during the
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:35.960]   Quarantine just to remind me that this is humans are you know, we're we can get through it. We can do it
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:39.400]   Uh, we've got this this hasn't bothered to be really one bit though
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:41.720]   The my least income my most thing can be a thing
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:45.240]   Is not being able to go to movies every other day. Otherwise I can really care less
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:47.560]   I love talking to people like a plane
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:52.680]   And I just say to them. I wonder how people got along in jail or concentration of kids
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:55.880]   I wonder how long you could pick cotton in the alabama sun
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:01.400]   Knowing that your livelihood and meal and food dependent on the end of the day. This oppression must be killing you
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:05.880]   The tyranny wearing up the mask. I just I don't know how you could do it living
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:08.920]   The education your kids aren't getting their good education
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:13.480]   I wonder how people in the inner cities feel about this when they've been living with it for the last 40 years
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:19.560]   And you've only been dealing with for three months. Oh my the the the tear you must be living in well. Thank god
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:23.800]   Thank god. Can I put it in a bid for for a
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:29.240]   Slightly more compassionate version of that. So I have like I I have a direct experience with this
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:32.760]   So my my grandparents were both refugees my grandmother was
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.560]   A child soldier in the siege of London grads that she was inducted in civil defense corps when she was 12
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:40.200]   And she witnessed
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:45.320]   Cannibalism and she was hauling corpses and hauling you know ammo up to the front and so on
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.560]   And my grandfather also had a tough time
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.720]   He left poland when he was 15
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:55.960]   And uh started bicycling to keev to get away from the nazis when they marched on poland who's picked up by a red army patrol
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:01.240]   And drafted and he met my grandmother in Siberia after they evacuated the women and children from leningrad
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.160]   And knocked her up. She got pregnant at 15. He was 17
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:09.240]   Uh, and then they ended up in azar by john they deserted from the red army
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:12.760]   They made their way to canada on a refugee boat and they ended up divorced
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:16.520]   Uh, and my grandfather had a lot of problems. He was um
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:23.000]   uh chronically depressed probably had an anxiety disorder and he self-medicated with booze and he had an addiction disorder
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.000]   And he was he was never able to get over the trauma
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.040]   Of what he went through and my grandmother whose trauma was much more intense
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:38.040]   I mean far more intense than anything my grandfather went through. I mean she literally watched people eating other humans
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:44.200]   Right during the siege of leningrad people there wasn't a rat left in leningrad after the siege because every rat had been eaten
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:49.880]   Is the largest uh death toll in any city and any time in human history?
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:55.080]   It was a million people. It was some huge. Yeah, one one point six. I think a million people died
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:59.480]   So she she bounced back. I mean she wasn't she there was she would have her dark moments
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:06.360]   She had missed over one time. We went to st. Petersburg in 2006 and we walked around and she talked about the places she'd seen
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:09.720]   She went with terrible things. Yeah. Yeah, oh my god
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:15.800]   For the most part she was a happy and well-balanced individual. Whereas my grandfather used to call us up in tears
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:23.240]   Just just for no reason he'd be drunk and crying and alone. He never formed lasting relationships after after his divorce
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:29.000]   And I think that people's trauma is the intersection of their resilience
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.480]   And their circumstances
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:35.400]   And I think that there are people who are experiencing this in very acute ways
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.160]   Even though it's not as bad as being in a concentration camp
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:42.680]   Who are nevertheless not gonna get over it, right?
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:46.440]   And I think that like and I know you were just kidding around and I know things
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:51.560]   I'm not really can't get my basic point was the people that aren't suffering are the ones complaining
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:54.600]   There's people that are homeless right now. There's people that don't have food right now
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:59.480]   But when somebody's going into a store waiting in line at best buy to buy a $700 tv
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:02.680]   Are complaining because they have to wear a mask those are the people I'm talking about
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:09.160]   Don't have any reason right now to even complain about excuse there's really no excuse
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.000]   For that
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.720]   Saying everyone is a blanket statement of things because there's a lot of people right now who are suffering things are
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:20.440]   Are going to traumatize them. They are getting evicted. They are trying to fight food banks for food
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:23.480]   They don't have insurance. They can't see their doctor their kids
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.240]   Don't even have Wi-Fi to get on a free laptop to do their school
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.240]   So I'm not talking about those people
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.560]   I'm talking about the people that complain walking into a store for three minutes about wearing a mask
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:35.960]   Those would be my
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:41.240]   And like you mentioned Wi-Fi and it's an important point here and to bring it back all the way around to competition
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:46.280]   You know frontiers went bankrupt at the start of the crisis and because they went bankrupt
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:49.560]   We got to see their their papers right because they had to do bankruptcy filings
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:53.640]   And one of the things that we learned from frontier who were the worst ISP in America
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:58:00.600]   Was that there were three million households that they could have profitably connected to 100 gigabit fiber
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:05.080]   But the amortization period for that investment was 10 years
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:09.960]   So they would have put a billion dollars in and they would have gotten 1.9 billion dollars out over 10 years
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:14.280]   And that they chose not to make $900 million
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:19.960]   Because the analysts who dominate the share prices of telecoms companies
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:24.600]   Downrate any company that makes an investment that takes more than five years to pay out
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:27.880]   And the executive suite at frontier are paid in stock
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:31.400]   Right and so to preserve their paycheck, right
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:36.760]   There are three million households in america right now on copper on 20th century copper infrastructure
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:41.080]   Whose kids are trying to learn whose parents are trying to do their jobs who are trying to get their
[01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:47.480]   Telemedicine who are trying to stay in touch with family and friends who are on this absolutely garbage
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:51.800]   You know like like just bailing wire and spit telecoms infrastructure
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:54.280]   Not because it wasn't profitable to connect them
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:58.040]   But because the 800 million dollars they would have made over 10 years
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:03.320]   Would not account for the two or three million dollars the ceo and the rest of the ceas we would have lost in their
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:06.840]   Stock compensation because of the actions of a few
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:12.680]   Uh analysts and you know that's where competition is the rubber that meets the road
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:18.200]   That's a shocking story. I did not know that story. That's true. That's oh yeah. The frontier thing is so gross
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:22.360]   I knew they were awful because when when they took over big swaths of l.a
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:27.560]   I don't know if you you're a frontier customer, but I heard nothing but but horror stories from the people
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:33.160]   Just brutal they booked one million households as an asset on the grounds that there was no other provider
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:37.880]   So they weren't even in a duopoly. They were in a pyramid opally. There wasn't like there was a cable operator in a telco
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:43.480]   And they booked those as an asset and in there in their accounting for that asset
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:50.360]   They calculated how badly they could gouge them and how little service they could provide to them before they would cancel their contracts
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:54.360]   I mean, you know
[01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:56.600]   Emily LaTella
[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:59.880]   I don't have we don't have to care. It's the phone company. I mean, yeah
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:02.200]   We are like we are living a
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:07.800]   1977 at live sketch when it comes to our telecoms infrastructure, and it's never been more important
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:12.360]   I have to think as a sci-fi writer you're you're intrigued corry by
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:15.320]   Oh, are you can you hear me?
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:20.040]   All right, we're gonna all right. I want to take a break when we come back. I want to talk about elon musk's neural link
[02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:23.800]   Uh with corry doctor says we can get him back. We're gonna get him back
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:30.760]   We had a great week this week on twit fortunately with memorial in february of 2021 15 years
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:34.360]   And a lot of that tick we were so young when we started
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:39.400]   I remember I said can you do it like at ten at night and I said I have to ask my mother
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:40.920]   Can't my bedtime?
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.680]   previously on twit
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:45.240]   tech news weekly
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:52.440]   As I often say no technology no matter how great it is comes without a cost to the environment and solar panels are no
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:59.080]   Exceptions to that, you know, we have millions and millions of panels being installed around the world now and these panels don't last forever
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:01.640]   When they die we need to deal with their disposal
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:07.240]   iOS today and today we are talking about air quality
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:13.240]   Your environment. Yes, we dink surround here right now. It is smoky bokey, baby
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.200]   Security now these researchers have shown
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:23.160]   That just capturing the sound of a traditional physical key being slid into its lock
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:27.400]   Is all that's needed to recreate that key
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:32.520]   Windows weekly what a day what a day will never forget it windows
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:38.200]   It's age 25 years ago. Oh, man a lot of those icons are still in windows
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:41.480]   So twit now in color
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.920]   living color
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:47.560]   Um
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:55.480]   Show today brought to you quite literally by cash fly. It's our content delivery network. They've been innovating cdns since
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.640]   1999
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:03.720]   Uh, we were struggling when we first started twit 15 years ago trying to figure out how to get you how to get the bandwidth
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:07.000]   To get you the shows we tried everything bit torrent
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.280]   We tried everything plain old web downloads
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.640]   And then my hero matt levine founder of cash fly called me and said we can help
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:20.040]   We can help and man they have for for for a good portion of those 15 years
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:22.600]   And cash fly
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:24.440]   Not only is faster
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:31.720]   Not only will save you as much as 20 percent over your existing bills. They have a new way that can really save they call cash flies
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:33.240]   SOS
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:37.160]   Their storage optimization system cdns work by
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:45.720]   By caching your content bringing it to a server close to your end point whether it's a an app or a website or or a podcast
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.840]   And uh, your customers will download it from a server near them. That's why it's a lot faster
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.240]   But every once in a while
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:55.240]   You get a cash miss
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:03:01.480]   It's not on that server yet and it has to the content has to be loaded when the pikas first out comes out has to be loaded
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:04.680]   Uh from your storage in our case amazon z3
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:07.560]   But the problem with that is
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.040]   You're suddenly paying big money for transfer out fees
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:15.400]   You're suddenly slowed down by the public internet
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:20.600]   SOS solves this problem and I have to say we've been using this for a long time with cash fly SOS
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.720]   You get a hundred percent cash hit ratio
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:28.440]   Once you're a cash fly customer, you decide how much storage you need they take care of the rest
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:35.000]   And I save so much money because and you get faster downloads. There's no buffering
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:42.840]   No delays while we're while we're feeding the the cash fly servers because we're on cash fly system our content lives there

[02:05:55.960 --> 02:06:02.360]   They are the backbone to what we do. We really appreciate cash while i was being taken care of you for a long time. I'm gonna leon
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:03.800]   long time
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:09.000]   And you know what i i never hear anybody say oh it was really slow to download the show today. It never happens
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:15.400]   They don't even people don't even know and it's just for the record. I don't blame them. Everything's any connected. Yeah
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:22.520]   For you don't blame him for what kory for my disconnection there. No, that wasn't cash flies fault. That was probably frontier
[02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:24.600]   Yeah
[02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:27.240]   Saying how dare you are you on frontier?
[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:30.840]   No, no, i'm on charter frontiers bankrupt
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:38.120]   Uh, but they can't afford ninjas anymore. I mean as i'm sure as i'm sure a doctor can tell us ninjas don't come cheap
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:40.360]   Not at all. Yeah
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:43.400]   They uh they bought up what was it spectrum? Who did they buy?
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:46.280]   I think it was charter right in LA area
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:52.280]   Uh, they bought up a lot and I have so many charter. I heard for so many people charter spectrum
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.520]   Yeah, just terrible just terrible
[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:59.880]   So elon musk is at it again. I I I just never know what to think about this guy
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:06.520]   Uh, I think on the one hand he's nuts. He's nuts, but on the other hand. I love spacex
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:12.040]   I loved my tesla and i'm fascinated by neural link as a sci-fi writer. You must be too kory. I mean
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:17.160]   who didn't read, you know, you know, uh, neural mancer or
[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:23.320]   neil stevenson's amazing uh books about the the metaverse
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:29.720]   We all we all can't wait for that human machine interface again those books were warnings not suggestions
[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:34.440]   Okay, good point. Maybe elon didn't read them the same way we did
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:38.520]   There is like if there is any phrase scarier than neural interface beta tester
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:42.840]   Neural interface beta tester for man who claims to have been red pilled
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:48.760]   blocks his wife just after she's given birth to his child and uh, and and also, um
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:55.400]   Periodically like post things like i'm a utopia and socialist and it's just a coincidence that i'm under investigation by the national
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:08:03.480]   Labor board. Yeah for union busting just a coincidence just a coincidence. No no big deal. So, uh, he gave a hundred million dollars
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:05.880]   To a company called neural link
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:12.280]   Uh, they have I think 150 million in funding they're trying to create a human machine interface
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:15.640]   Uh this week they had a demonstration of neural link
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:18.840]   A 2.0, which is apparently installed in a pig
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:23.640]   Uh, and they also demonstrated their concept for this machine
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:28.680]   Let me just explain what it does before you put your head in there. Okay
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:31.320]   Uh
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:36.600]   It just drills a little hole in your skull takes a little piece out of your just a little just a little one little piece out of your
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:39.240]   skull and then
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:45.080]   It'll be able they're gonna put it back. Don't worry and then using computer vision algorithms. They guide a needle
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:51.960]   containing five micron thick bundles of wires five microns is like, uh, you know, uh,
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:09:00.440]   Um a human hair. Okay, actually a quarter of the human hair and uh, and they the bundle of wires and insulation
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:04.360]   They they guide them into the brain about six millimeters deep into the brain
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:07.560]   They avoid blood vessels because you wouldn't want to hit one of those
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:11.160]   So and then and then they're linked to a series of electrodes
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:15.400]   Inside the brain they pick specific locations and depths
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:22.680]   Uh, if the machine is running at full capacity you can insert six threads containing 192 electrodes a minute
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:26.040]   Uh, and then uh, they put your skull back
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:31.720]   There's a cellophane like sheet that pairs to your smartphone using bluetooth
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:38.760]   And uh, you're now you're now linked up. It's a it's a the link is an acic a thin film
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:45.080]   in a hermetic uh substrate that can interface with those thousand electrodes in your brain
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:50.920]   And then they can well right now they can only read the brain. Although they demonstrated it on a pig. Look at this
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:10:00.440]   There you go folks. How now how much would you pay? Uh, this pig the ai is predicting the limbs motions
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:06.840]   Based on the neural link implant data on the pig they had three pigs one had this one didn't have it
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:09.240]   And then there was a third control pig
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:12.040]   Uh
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:18.760]   20 000 megapixels of neural data for each of the 1024 channels
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:21.000]   I think look
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]   We're in the early days of this
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.560]   Um in theory
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:30.280]   One of their goals would be to allow a tetra-plegic to type at 40 words per minute
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:37.400]   Uh, eventually elan says he hopes the system will use to create what he describes as a quote digital
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:39.260]   super intelligent
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:44.440]   cognitive layer that labels humans to merge with artificially intelligent software
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:47.400]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:49.560]   well, okay, so
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:54.360]   Basically tiktok has taken algorithmic, uh, mind control as far as it can go and this is the next phase
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:56.360]   That's one way to look at this the next step. Yeah, but
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:04.760]   One of the things that elan musk likes to do is he likes to exploit the delusion about the lone inventor
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:09.240]   The person toil he wayne is lab, you know who invents the next big thing all by himself
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:12.280]   And of course that's never the case and never has been the case
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:18.120]   This sort of research that he has announcing has been going on for literally decades
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:26.200]   And will continue for literally decades by literally thousands of different research organizations to try to figure out how to interact with the mind
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:28.680]   directly through software, etc
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:33.400]   And and so a lot of this is a it's a it's a lot of show boating
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:37.560]   I mean he wants to get in on this business right with his company neural link
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:46.840]   But he's not doing anything that significantly more advanced or exotic or different or revolutionary than lots of other organizations
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:50.680]   Uh, he's just getting in front of it and presenting himself
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:54.520]   Uh as the as the thomas Edison of our age
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:59.800]   Uh, which in fact he is not uh, he is a great business leader and is very successful
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:05.720]   And yes elan i'm looking forward to to to to to the to to the satellite internet connection i'm really
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:08.280]   Looking for that. You're counting on starlings
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:11.800]   Uh, this is this
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:14.280]   But this is a whole lot of bs
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:15.320]   Um
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:19.320]   Uh, we are not going to be putting our heads in that machine anytime soon
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:23.160]   I love it the core he says yes, but they were warning you against
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.640]   Against this
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.160]   See i misread it and i guess elan did too. I thought that sounds pretty cool
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:32.200]   I thought snow crash was really cool little did i know
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:37.640]   Uh frankenstein was not a manual for your muted your muted cori
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:42.440]   Unmute and there we go. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:46.200]   So, you know, he is a very entertaining fellow, but he's also a charlatan
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.560]   And so this raises the question like if you were interested in some really entertaining neuroscience
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:57.560]   Could you find someone who was in a charlatan and and i i'll propose that i have a recommendation
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:01.160]   There's a guy at ucsd called brad void tech. He's a neuro anatomist
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.680]   V o y t e t e k brad void tech
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:09.560]   He's a neuro anatomist. He came and taught one of my uh classes at ucsd a few years ago
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:12.280]   When i was teaching the clary and science fiction writing workshop
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:16.600]   And the way that he teaches neuro anatomy is with zombie movies
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:18.760]   So he's like
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:24.520]   Here's this movie in which the every time the bell rings at the gas station the zombie gas attendant comes out and goes
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:27.400]   picks up the gas
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:31.880]   What neuro anatomical insult corresponds to this behavior
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:32.600]   Right?
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:37.320]   So he like because this is what neuro anatomists do is they have to solve these like uh detective
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:42.840]   Stories, right where you you observe some facts and you have to hypothesize what's going on in the brain
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:48.040]   And and he does this with with you know videos and lessons. I think he's written a book
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:51.720]   So yes, the book is do zombies dream of undead sheep
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:53.480]   There you go
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:57.800]   So, you know like if you're into uh if you're into like entertaining neuroscience
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:02.600]   There is a totally non charlatan video version of that's awesome
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.000]   I completely recommend he's a riveting speaker
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.720]   And of course he's got great audiovisual aids because it's just like highlight reels of zombie movies
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.080]   We're not going to mars
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:17.080]   We're not
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:19.080]   I wanted to go to
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:25.960]   We're not going to solve anything and it turns out as uh, I learned from Daniel
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:30.440]   You know what he's he wants to make see the thing that bothers me about really smart
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:33.080]   People i'm not even gonna put
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:38.840]   Efforts on that that want to certain people just are so smart and then they become so rich and I think to myself
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:42.040]   So you want to make tunnel so you can skip traffic?
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:46.600]   How about you make tunnels so that we don't have the cesspool of trash
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:50.920]   In la how about you just fix the sewer system in la real quick?
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:53.240]   Can you fix that for me genius boy?
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:55.640]   Could you can you hide believe trash?
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:58.200]   Could you figure out a way to we're now sending a blow back
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:05.560]   Right because like that there is no set like if you multiply the size of even the smallest one person car
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:08.840]   By the number of people who need to get anywhere in los angeles
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:11.960]   And then divide it by the amount of road we have
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:16.520]   You can't solve this problem with cars. You can only solve it with public transit
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.360]   And he's just like well, maybe the roles of geometry are different when you're a billionaire
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.080]   And they're not right and the same way like
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:31.640]   Again, I just really mad when really smart rich people come with these ideas as you just
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:34.200]   Eloquently stated and so did mike
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:39.480]   There's other people doing a better job of this and you're taking up media time and money and marketing and brand
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:41.080]   And you made this stupid machine
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:45.160]   The nobody's gonna stick their head in and you messed up a good pig that picket either had a happy life
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:48.200]   Or could have been on my plate and been some bacon you don't mess up this pig
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:52.600]   Now nobody's gonna get this pig and you're gonna have many other pigs like this you're doing too penis caught
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.560]   It's from other pigs going through right?
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.800]   Yeah, it comes to get into bars
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:03.400]   You know like that like the amount of hydrocarbons we would need like the the co2 budget
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:12.360]   For lifting an appreciable fraction of the human race off of earth would render the planet earth permanently uninhabitable by everyone who remains
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:14.840]   Right so like his
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:17.560]   You know i'm all for like let's put some scientists on mars first
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:20.440]   Let's put a bunch of robots on mars because that's better than scientists
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:27.320]   But eventually maybe we'll put some scientists on mars but the idea that space colonization is the answer to climate crisis
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:29.720]   It's like planet we're on
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:35.320]   It's just you know, you cannot like it's just it's just math right like then there's Alex carp
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:41.400]   Who um has also a unique view of the world. He is the ceo of palantir
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:46.360]   Which is the silicon valley the secret of silicon valley company funded by petered teal which
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:51.160]   Apparently is about to do an ipo in a letter to investors
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:55.320]   Which i just i found fascinating
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:57.560]   um
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:59.560]   He makes the case that
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:03.800]   It's almost as if saying we've created problems that only i can solve
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:10.040]   Uh our customers come to us because their technological infrastructure has failed them
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:15.160]   The enterprise software industries focus on custom software tools and applications is misplaced
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:18.120]   These approaches often only work briefly if at all
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:23.320]   The problems and needs of an organization often change before the software can be deployed
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:28.120]   Our partners require something more by the way. I hope in this ipo process
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.440]   We'll find out exactly what palantir is doing
[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:35.560]   Uh, he says they need generalizable platforms for modeling the world and making decisions
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.560]   I can tell you what they're doing. That's what we've built. What is palantir doing only cori doctor?
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:44.200]   Oh, no, so this is what he means what he means is that like say you're the government of ethiopia
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:49.320]   Which is a corrupt failed state run by a clique of autocrats, right?
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:55.800]   And like every time you tried to hire someone to help you spy on people so you could figure out who to arrest and torture before they could build a guillotine on your lawn
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:59.160]   Was a grifter from a big five consulting firm like mckenzie
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:03.640]   And they just took your money and delivered garbage software and palantir won't deliver garbage software
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:06.200]   They will deliver turnkey autocracy
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:11.800]   Right they will sell you the tools that will allow you to pinpoint exactly who you should round up and torture and murder
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:15.640]   So that nobody builds a guillotine on your lawn for being such a terrible autocrat
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:19.800]   And that's like it's it's it's it is totalitarianism as a service
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:24.680]   The fact that they haven't managed to make a profit at it yet is the most hilarious part of all of this, right?
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:26.680]   Like
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:28.760]   Rapid clip
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:30.760]   What is the other
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:31.960]   Silicon Valley then?
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:32.440]   Well, yeah
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:36.760]   But here's the difference right when mckenzie or like anderson show up
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:40.760]   Anything in adas ababa and say like let us deliver some spyware for you
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:42.360]   They just rip them off
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:47.640]   Right the same way they did like the same way they did with the british government when they were like let us build your welfare system
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:52.200]   And they just you know tortured a bunch of people to death by delivering a non non-functional welfare
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:56.040]   Delivery system, but but palant and they make money
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:58.520]   Right they make money from stupid autocrats, right?
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:02.120]   They can go into azar by john and make a fortune delivering
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:08.040]   Non-functional totalitarianism where palant here delivers working software and can't get it
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:11.640]   I think this is bizarre
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:18.360]   Right like like talk about an organization that could not pour a piss out of a boot with instructions printed on the goddamn heel
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:22.040]   It is a remark of the story
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:22.840]   I love it
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:28.920]   the construction of software platforms that he writes that enable more effective surveillance by the state
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:35.240]   Of its adversaries or that assist soldiers in executing attacks raises countless issues
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:43.080]   Involving the points of tension and trade-offs between our collective security and individual privacy
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:48.200]   The fact that they just lifted a whole bunch from the trial of Adolf eichmann as part of their s1
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:50.680]   It's a
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:53.720]   It is a ballsy move
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:58.840]   The ethical challenges that are arising are a constant and unrelenting
[02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:01.240]   German accent leo
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:06.040]   The building the engineering elite of silicon valley may know more
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:13.720]   Then most about building software, but they do not know more about how society should be organized over justice requires
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:18.120]   Now you know what it makes more sense in german. You're absolutely right
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:23.400]   Our software is used to target terrorists and keep soldiers safe
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:29.480]   If we are going to ask someone to put themselves in harm's way, we believe we have a duty to give them what they need to do their job
[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:32.600]   Hogan we have chosen sides
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:38.600]   And we know that our partners value our commitment. Please stand by the minutes convenient and when it is not
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:41.480]   They raise four billion dollars. Yeah
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:44.680]   This is this is definitely my god once busy season. I tell you
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:47.960]   He was right. He was right
[02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:56.200]   Uh, wow, okay, okay, I could go on and on and i'm sure we we really would love to but I suppose at some point we have to
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:21:02.280]   Pull the plug on this there's so much more to talk about I uh, I have pre-ordered the amazon halo
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:06.120]   Which is a fitness band that will tell me when i'm yelling
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:09.880]   I swear to god
[02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:11.880]   I swear to god
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:14.520]   I can't hear who's incredibly intolerant of raised voices
[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:18.760]   There's a reason i've closed the door to have this interview or my wife would be very upset with me
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:21.720]   So of course it measures your sleep
[02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:26.760]   And it measures your exercise, but they also have two microphones on it
[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:31.480]   And the idea is the tone of voice analysis tool
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:34.200]   Or tone for short
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:40.040]   Compliments traditional metrics like sleep and activity by helping you understand how you sound to others
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:45.400]   It uses machine learning to analyze the positivity and energy of your voice
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:51.320]   Positivity is measured by how happy or sad you sound energy by how excited or tired
[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:53.800]   Stop crying Clarisse
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:22:01.720]   I want to find kianti the amazon halo app then turns out analysis and daily summaries that include easy to understand descriptors
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:06.280]   For example, you might see that in the morning you sound calm delighted and warm
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:14.200]   What could jeff Bezos do with this information? I don't know, but I I can't wait. I hope I get selected you have to apply
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:20.440]   Uh to get one of you want me on there. They'd be like why is this guy rent and he's on a roller coaster. He's happy
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:22.440]   He's angry and sad
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:24.680]   Who is this man by the way?
[02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:26.120]   You know
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:30.360]   During the culture revolution they would like kidnap your dad and take him north through reeducation
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:33.720]   Then put a bullet through his brain and then send you the invoice for the bullet
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:36.600]   You're gonna pay for this thing
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:39.400]   It's the invoice for the bullet
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:42.440]   By the way, I just want to say i'm reassured
[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:49.800]   Bezos says the way you communicate is incredibly personal. That's why we designed tone with your privacy in mind
[02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:53.800]   If you choose to go ahead
[02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:59.640]   I've read i've read amazon's privacy policies. They are golden. They are absolutely golden
[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:05.000]   They put nothing in there about that. We're not going to do this. We're not going to do that. We're not going to they
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:12.040]   Read the privacy policy leo. You will really get a kick out of it. They say I can turn the mics off anytime I want
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:18.280]   And uh, the speech samples are never sent to the cloud. Nobody ever hears them
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:22.760]   And you have full control of your voice data including the ability to delete tone results
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.920]   And your entire voice profile from the app
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:29.800]   So the reason that's in there is because they were caught lying about this before they're like we're not like
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:34.120]   They were listening this time we're not you know as as as the eminent american philosopher
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:35.960]   George w bush one said
[02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:40.920]   Fool me once shame on me. Fool me twice. We don't get fooled again. I think that's a saying in tennessee
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:43.640]   Maybe in texas you memorized it
[02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:49.560]   When a president he was just trying to put food on his family. Come on give me a break
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:55.560]   So leo did it actually say that it would delete it from the app
[02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:57.560]   Yeah
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:03.160]   Not from their servers. No, I mean, yeah, anyway, uh, you know, i'm gonna wear it
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:07.480]   Uh, if I start getting advertisements for I don't know
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:10.600]   What what might I get advertisements?
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:11.400]   Shout a
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:14.840]   Shout a product from man who shouts your plugs
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:18.760]   We notice you've been particularly angry lately
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:22.280]   Lisa's gonna get advertisement would you like to a
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:25.560]   Shout louder
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:32.600]   Uh clippy could have fun with this one. Corey doctor. Oh's next novels called attack service. It comes out october
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:37.240]   Uh, we will put a link in the show notes to where you can order it go to pluralistic.net
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:38.840]   Of course to keep up on
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:41.640]   Corey's link role, which is today still today
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:48.760]   Really the best place to find the funnest stuff online as you can see he's also one of the smartest people in the world today
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:54.840]   Read his new book on medium one zero dot medium dot com are you gonna print that or publish it in some form?
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.000]   Yeah, they're publishing it as an actual book and also as an ebook
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:05.880]   It's really good reading how to destroy surveillance capitalism. It grabbed me and I I just was fascinated
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:09.160]   Uh, buy it. Oh doctor. Is it I cute him
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:11.560]   Nope
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:16.040]   You know the rules. Oh, yeah, okay. I'm not doctor has to end the show. Sorry. I apologize
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:20.760]   Uh, let's just quickly say mike elgin is at elgin.com
[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:24.760]   He is at mike elgin on twitter and he also has mike's list, which is another
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:31.000]   Between those two mailing lists. I got everything I want all the all the fun little tidbits the internet is so good at
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.120]   Uh, thank you and can I plug one quick thing? Yes
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:40.280]   So gastronomad experiences are ramping up for 2021 where where it we're gonna
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:42.520]   It's gonna be amazing
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:48.680]   And we are built in like a social distancing kind of a situation because of the way we do everything
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.160]   We live together in a in a farmhouse
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:56.760]   We go out and we do activities with a single person instead of like mingling with tourists
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:02.520]   So it's really ramping up people are uh signing up fast because there's a lot of pent up desire to travel so
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:05.080]   Check us out instanexonad.net
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:07.880]   Uh, oh man, uh, that's
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:10.440]   Provence in the spring
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:13.400]   Yeah, we added another provence because our first
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:15.800]   Provence next summer is sold out
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:20.840]   So we added a second Provence experience during the summer during the lavender season next year. So
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:25.000]   Definitely want to get it on man. I want to do that one too. You're gonna be in fez in uh
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.560]   Morocco, right where are you gonna be?
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:31.640]   We try and for maraco. It's a two-week experience and we travel the entire country. So fez maracch
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:36.840]   Uh chef shawin we go to the beach. We do it. We do it all go to the desert
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.640]   I love tancier. I just I can't this is I really want to do this one
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:43.480]   That that sounds amazing
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:48.440]   And you've the thing about these are great is you've done the footwork. You know the people you know the experience
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:54.520]   You are really a great guides of all this and it's it's around food, but it's also around culture and people
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:58.040]   So this is this is travel the way it was meant to be. This is not true
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:03.720]   Most of the people we interact with the winemakers the chefs and so on are personal good great friends of ours
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:07.800]   We've known for many years. So it's you're you're you're like family when you're doing this thing
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:10.600]   So it's it's really a transformative thing. So
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:15.080]   Next year it's going to be a huge year for gastronomad stuff
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:22.360]   I can't wait. Yep as because everybody would be dying to travel get out of the house. Yes gastronomad.net to learn about the
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:25.720]   Wonderful events coming up. I'm glad you're getting back on the
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:29.400]   On the gastronomad train. Thank you. It's like a lot of fun
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:35.880]   And now as is always the case when oh doc is on the show. I don't know how when did this start? Oh doctor
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:41.240]   So since I have to sit in your chair when I used to visit uncle leo he gets the last
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:45.240]   Been a long time the last word we've talked about chickenization
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:49.240]   We've talked about totalitarianism as aism as a service
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:56.280]   We've talked about gerbils. We've you are we're talking about black panther
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:28:02.520]   Uh, Chadwick boseman. You are going to get to have the final word ladies and gentlemen. I give you all in jj stone
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:04.520]   We call him oh doctor
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:09.320]   So first thing a great show. I was super quiet today because there were people that were vastly
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:12.920]   Smarter than me and I didn't feel like dueling and getting stabbed to death
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:16.040]   So that's why I was quiet. I can learn some of the two I was taking notes
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:19.720]   I got spellings to check up on after the show. So I got I got some work to do
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:22.680]   Do myself together this episode
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:26.840]   but um I get a lot of emails for people after I'm wanting to show and uh
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:30.280]   Most of them are great. Some people yell at me and they have a problem me
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:35.320]   And I fully understand how they can seem that like I'm so angry or some people think I'm too happy
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:37.480]   So I just want to tell you one experience of mine
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:42.600]   So do you understand like the climate that we're in in the world when you see people get frustrated and they lash out?
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:43.640]   Okay
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:47.400]   I'm doing pretty well for myself at a certain point in time. I say I'm going to buy a big house
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:51.480]   I buy a big house in a nice neighborhood three thousand square feet three car garage
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:54.680]   It's only me and my daughter, but I feel like I deserve it. So I get it
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:29:00.200]   And the three years I lived there I got pulled over 87 times in that neighborhood or generally around that area
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:01.800]   I only got six tickets
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:06.120]   So you do the math on how many times I was pulled over for no reason just because I had a nice car
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:08.360]   And I look like I look and I'm in a nice area
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:14.200]   Back when sandy hit a big storm people kind of know about it the power went out of my house
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:19.160]   I went to go stay at a friend's house in philadelphia. I come back home. My house is robbed
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:25.400]   $50,000 of the equipment my computers my cameras all the stuff that I do and use to make a living for myself
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:28.840]   We're all gone. They left the TVs on the wall because I guess they couldn't get them out
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:31.080]   But everything else of electronic value was gone
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:34.760]   Um, I didn't call the police out to my home
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.840]   I went to the police station to file a report
[02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:39.320]   The detective as he's taken on our port. He said well
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:45.320]   Why didn't she call us out to the house? And I said I've seen videos of people calling police when their home has been invaded and they've been shot
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:48.120]   And he looked at me and said fair point
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:50.360]   Oh, I thought I support
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:52.440]   Clicked on the police report
[02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:54.440]   I filed my insurance company
[02:29:54.440 --> 02:30:00.360]   Now sally for me they did take my safe which had a lot of my receipts the paperwork receipts in there
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:02.520]   And I had copies of them scanned in the cloud
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:05.960]   But the insurance company kind of screwed me out of $60,000 of equipment
[02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:11.160]   Because they said that I could falsify these documents that were scanned because I don't have the paper documentation
[02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:14.680]   So I get really frustrated with my life. I think to myself
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:20.120]   I've been pulled over so many times and it's nice beautiful home. It's too big for me. Anyway, I'm going to sell it take a loss and move
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:24.520]   As I'm packing up to move with my daughter. You have the door open. Have you ever moved out of a place?
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:27.480]   I left the door because I'm coming in and out
[02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:34.920]   I come downstairs. There's 12 cops outside my house. She's 11 in the front. No 10 in the front two in the back
[02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:37.480]   Guns drawn
[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:41.880]   Sorry to have idea. What are you doing here? Blah blah blah blah. I said whoa what's going on?
[02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:45.160]   Like oh, we've had a lot of robberies on the street. I'm like, yeah, I know I'm one of the people
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:48.920]   Well, I need your license. What do you need my last? There's moving boxes here
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:52.280]   I'm I'm packing up with my child. Why do you why do I have to get you my ID?
[02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:56.840]   Now mind you all these people have guns in their hands and they're all very anxious and I'm just like dude
[02:30:56.840 --> 02:31:01.160]   My detective's name is detective. She's actually name is Michael Jackson funny enough
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:04.440]   His name is Michael Jackson. How would I know the detective like
[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:09.240]   I've had a gun pulled on me by cops four times in my lifetime the first time
[02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:13.560]   I was 11 years old and it took another cop to come and grab that cop and say hey
[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:15.240]   This is a kid put your gun down
[02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:20.920]   So I do know that there's crazy people that shouldn't have guns and there's good people that have common sense working in that business
[02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:24.600]   But I take it back to where I was living at in that time frame
[02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:27.640]   Lost everything still got harassed
[02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:31.720]   But you wouldn't know that I come on this show and I make jokes and I have fun
[02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:35.880]   And I just do what I got to do and I'm ranting and raving and joe josh joccan
[02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:39.400]   Because that's the way I have to live my life and those are things I have to do on a regular basis
[02:31:39.400 --> 02:31:42.440]   So when you see things out in the world you wonder why people get soft set
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:46.280]   It's because I'm not the only person who gets pulled over all the time for no reason
[02:31:46.280 --> 02:31:48.280]   I'm not the only person who gets harassed for no reason
[02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:51.880]   I'm not the only person who's had a gun pulled on them for literally no reason
[02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:55.960]   But I have to go on about my day and be thankful and say sorry
[02:31:55.960 --> 02:31:58.680]   Yes, sir. No, sir and tell the line
[02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:00.760]   And I say that to say
[02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:05.000]   tomorrow i'm putting up a video from two years ago from me and aunt that I've recorded
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:09.000]   Because I got so depressed and all my stuff got so I've reposted it
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:13.240]   But i'm trying to be in my chat week bozeman and tell you again to do better
[02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:17.080]   Even though I built myself back up. I got all my cameras back. I got all my lenses back
[02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:20.440]   I worked hard. I bought new stuff. I got a new insurance company
[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:23.400]   And I've got myself back on my feet
[02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:27.720]   But you can do the same thing too. So if you're having a bad day, you're down
[02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:30.200]   I know some of my tweet him earlier and it said that I seem like i'm saying
[02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:33.240]   I'm really sad about this bozeman thing because I really think to myself
[02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:37.480]   I'm fat. I'm overweight. I'm living in a pandemic. I can die any day and I should be doing more
[02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:43.560]   So I again, I encourage you to do more and if you're still listening, I know you care enough to at least try for yourself
