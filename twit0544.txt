[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.720]   And of course, the post CES show is always a mixed bag made up of people who are exhausted
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.760]   and have nothing more to say about CES and people who didn't go and who are still bread
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.960]   eyed and bushy tailed. That's serenity called well in this case. You didn't go right?
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.520]   I did not this year. I managed somehow to get it off. And I was I just got off a boat.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.960]   So I'm rested but completely confused. And I'm still going like this. But look who's
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.920]   back from CES? Jason Heiner. He's a little. Hello. Hello. We restart. Hello editor in
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.360]   chief tech republic. Welcome home. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Back from Las Vegas. The
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.800]   worst city in the world. Oh man. And and brand new to the show. And I'm really glad to have
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.240]   Michael Nunez who is the technology editor at Popular Science. One of the great magazines
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.520]   of all time. It's great to have you on the show. Michael, thanks for joining us.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.600]   Oh yeah. Thanks for having me. This is great. I'm glad I could join. You just got home.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.920]   Yeah. Yeah. So so if I'm a little rough around the edges or my ideas are incomplete, I'm
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.760]   going to go ahead and apologize in advance because yeah, I'm still sort of adjusting
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.320]   to the Eastern time zone. And we got to wrap this up because the Golden Globes is on tonight.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.040]   And I can't wait to see what a hash Ricky Gervais makes it all. He's already tweeted
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.880]   by the way. I can't show his tweet on the air because it's not it's highly impolite.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.200]   But I can show his picture. This is minutes ago Ricky Gervais who will once again host
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.000]   the Golden Globes. And he says time to get up get dressed and perform for a bunch of humorless.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.600]   And then he says a very bad word indeed. Set in the stage for what should be a very good
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:54.520]   Golden Globes tonight. Yeah. Nobody's easy job though. The awards themselves are kind of
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.240]   ridiculous because it's the Hollywood Farm Press Association. But it's the only awards
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.360]   show where people are drinking during before during and after. So anything goes. I bet
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.160]   serenity you seem like a Golden Globes. Enjoy your I well in my in my former film life,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.800]   it was definitely something where my film friends and I would just sit around and start. I think
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.480]   it was Christina. I think it was Christina Warren who got me into this actually. She
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.800]   oh yeah. She was the first to tell me oh no you have to watch this show because everybody
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   is wrong. Well exactly the Globes the Globes is the the perennial you know cluster fan.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.000]   To put it in polite con nicely nicely said. Yes. Yeah. It's a it's a fun thing. So CES
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.360]   which stands for nothing in more ways than one. It used to be the consumer electronics
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.600]   show and then for reasons no one will understand the CEA which also is renamed I think renamed
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.880]   itself decided it doesn't stand for anything. It's just CTA. The CTA. Consumer technology
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.600]   so are they trying to confuse people. What is it they don't like the word consumer electronics.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.420]   Well I think that it's been more consumer like electronics sounds like you know your
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.480]   VCR from the 1980s. It's like I think they're trying to embrace the fact that everybody's
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.960]   that comes there and the vendors that come there are much broader. It's like really dominated
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.640]   by the car companies this year by the way. Which is interesting because the Detroit auto
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.220]   show is this week. Yes. Which would be the natural place for car companies to go except
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.760]   that they're trying to pretend that they're not cars. It's more like electronics devices.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.220]   They're computers on wheels. They're computers on wheels. Exactly. Yeah I think that was
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.460]   the major sentiment this year was that you know the Detroit auto show would be a great
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:51.540]   launching pad for all the new like 2017 models and sports cars from American brands but the
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.620]   more interesting stuff is what's happening in the cabins and in the motors of these vehicles.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:04.200]   So for instance the BMW i8, the 4GT, some of these futuristic cars were rolled out into
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.520]   the CES showroom and yeah I mean I think you know people like me who aren't or who are
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.880]   generally like not that interested in cars were actually attracted to these really well
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.700]   designed computers on wheels as he said. It's yeah it's a weird time to be looking at
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.300]   the automotive and the best of CES and I'm sure at least according to Engadget was in
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:37.460]   fact the Chevy Bolt not Volt. Bolt which is the Bolt EV yeah electric vehicle with a
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.460]   200 mile range which is a lot for an electric vehicle and so close to being what I want.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.300]   A $30,000 price tag what's missing. Yeah about 100 miles on the range. Yeah I would say a
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.860]   nice design would be on my list but I mean obviously it's great you know these electric
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.140]   vehicles that can drive a long distance are awesome but I don't understand why they can't
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.140]   just look like normal cars. I mean this thing is closer to a minivan. They do kind of all
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.740]   have to have swoopy doopy lines like they're trying to make them look a little futuristic
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.740]   don't they? They're trying to make it I mean they're copying the Honda Fit they're copying
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.660]   in some ways the Prius C although I think the Prius C looks heads and tails look better
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.620]   than that one. I mean some of it is just you know design it's it's Chevy trying to follow
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.300]   the trend instead of set the trend which is whatever but and also you know you have to
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.420]   have something that's easily manufacturable on a grand scale because if they're trying
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.740]   if they're selling this as this is our consumer electronic or our consumer electronics our
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.580]   consumer EV car right like this is the car that everyone that's affordable for everyone
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.260]   not just affordable for people who want to give EV a spin or people who have enough money
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.420]   to pay for Teslas they need it to be very very cheap to manufacture the chassis and the
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.100]   interiors because chances are they're still spending a buttload on battery and all of
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:00.780]   that nonsense. This is like a Tesla the battery's all in the bottom so which gives it good
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:07.860]   stability both for handling and just tippy tippy-bility. Yeah and it was big I mean I
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.260]   think it was clearly the biggest thing of the of the show bigger than the Samsung refrigerator
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:19.740]   with the camera and stuff bigger than that that that got a lot of attention it was for
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:26.140]   reasons I won't understand I mean it's not the first CES Samsung has introduced a computer
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:34.620]   refrigerator it's probably the tenth yeah this one is a screen oh and you close the door
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.060]   and the light stays on because you got a camera well you know you can blame some of
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.060]   that to some of the inexperienced writers and editors that were there but I mean I wouldn't
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.180]   consider that one of the best things that I know if you're just for CES then maybe but
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.740]   not yeah right yeah I mean yeah smart refrigerators I think people are generally interested to
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.940]   see like how quickly this stuff is going to be put into our homes and so you know it's
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.620]   nice to take a look at what's going on in those things and to pay attention to how computers
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.300]   are being embedded in everyday objects but like you know there would be very few people
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.140]   that would actually tell you that was one of the biggest pieces of news I think it was
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.020]   all about virtual reality this year and you know self-driving cars and some of these new
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.460]   car features like you were saying yeah yeah the cool thing about the you know the car thing
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.780]   was the biggest leap forward I thought for the past few years they've and I wrote a story
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:28.460]   about this you know called self-driving cars won the week at CES 2016 you know in the past
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.020]   years they've talked a little bit about these things but you know a lot happened this year
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:39.580]   in this space both with kind of EVs and and autonomous I mean Google in 2015 in the past
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.740]   year Google said they're going to have one ready for consumers by 2020 or that they think
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:50.420]   that there will be consumer you know autonomous vehicles by 2020 Tesla had their big download
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:57.100]   twenty five hundred dollar download that turned your your Tesla Model S into a self-driving
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.940]   vehicle or at least sort of the version of one and this weekend Elon Musk said by 2018
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:09.100]   that's the third S will come to you automatically yes he he said you know he upgraded his prediction
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.140]   in you know this fall he said we're gonna have the technology ready in two years and he said
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.580]   it'll take longer with regulations and those kinds of things before they're in the hands
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.140]   of consumers but he said the technology will be ready in two years and then there was also
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.940]   the rumor of course not just rumor it was based on the Guardian found these these documents
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.780]   these public documents that showed that Apple was working on an electronic vehicle that
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:38.620]   was also autonomous and so you know I think the automakers felt a lot of pressure because
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:45.900]   of that and you saw it in spades every single one of them was demoing or talking about their
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.620]   path to an autonomous autonomous vehicle.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:11:00.620]   Between seven and our chat room says it's news when Samsung makes a refrigerator that comes
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.620]   to me that I'd buy.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:08.620]   So this bolt looks so I'm on the waiting list for a Tesla the X the Falcon wing or whatever
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.980]   it is the hog.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:16.700]   But I'm not now I'm thinking I'm looking at this bolt it's about a third the price it's
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:23.820]   got almost the same range it has car play or Android auto which the Tesla does not and
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.340]   I think that's pretty important for me and it has a rear view mirror that's a camera.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.060]   Camera mirror my mother.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.500]   Yeah which is much safer by the way has a much wider angle and much fuller view.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.340]   Yeah so what so.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.460]   Yeah but it looks I mean come on do you do you really want to be seen driving something
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.260]   that looks like that like the Chevy bolt.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.260]   Well do I want to be seen with something with a car doors go like that.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.260]   I don't.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.420]   Yeah it's a bad to survive man.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   Really.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.380]   Yeah this thing looks I don't I don't like the bolt.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.820]   I don't I don't like the design I mean I don't understand why they couldn't shape it like
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.300]   a Toyota Camry or something.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.020]   Make it a sedan.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.380]   This is a crossover I think is the technical term.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.580]   Yeah it does have a lot of luggage space what do they say 500 cubic feet.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.140]   That can't be right.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.420]   That's the size of a cruise ship.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.900]   What I must have that wrong.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:29.660]   One 15 year old that sort of got overlooked was the that looks decent and is autonomous
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:35.300]   and an EV is the the Kia Soul EV this is a I put a picture of it in the top of my article
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.740]   on self-driving cars.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.740]   Okay.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.940]   The Soul EV Autonomous is actually being tested on public roads in Nevada this year.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.740]   So it's a it's an EV it's autonomous it's got a decent design because it's based on a
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.500]   real design that's out there and it's going to be.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.180]   You think this is good looking.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:00.540]   Well I don't think I think it's better looking than than than the than the shoe.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.540]   Yeah looks like.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.940]   Oh I hate the box.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.860]   I hate it so much.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.860]   The boxy is really in right now right now.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.860]   Yeah it is.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.860]   Like I know.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.860]   The Scion and the yeah.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.860]   Totally.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.860]   It's not my style.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.540]   So yeah people love it or hate it in terms of the box.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:22.820]   Ultimately for EV my like my big things are not necessarily style I love looking at stylish
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.300]   cars but when it comes to actually buying a day to day vehicle what I care.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.860]   Yeah what I care about is reliability.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.220]   And I would love I mean I've been driving a Prius for the last year and a half and I
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.980]   like I've become spoiled by gas mileage and I will never go back to an all gas car however
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.980]   pretty it looks but when it comes to like I would love for my next car to be straight
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.620]   EV but it needs I need at least two hundred and fifty mile range.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.820]   Electric engines are more reliable but the batteries are still a little bit of an unknown.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.500]   They're expensive to repair too.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.660]   This is this is kind of exactly what I said in my article though so runny this is what
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.620]   you're getting at was actually I think the future so cars have always been about style
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.580]   and they're still about style to a degree obviously we've been talking about you know
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.060]   it in terms of what Leo wants to buy next.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.060]   Yes please.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.380]   Let's talk about me.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.860]   The future of cars in you know this is what I wrote was that the future cars are going
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.780]   to be defined more by software and algorithms than by steel and rubber right it's going
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:29.860]   to be these cars in the future are going to be shells for a lot of big data and algorithms
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:36.860]   deep learning all kinds of of course the infotainment systems as well cloud it's going to really
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:42.580]   take until we get to you know we're not really going to get that EV and that autonomous vehicle
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:48.420]   even the really great ones until there's probably 5G until there's you know the processing power
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.140]   is a little stronger but it sets up really well for all these chip companies because these
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.540]   cars are going to need an incredible amount of code and incredible amount of processing
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.540]   power.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:04.380]   They already have a lot Ford said this week that the F-150 has 150,000 lines of code
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.260]   in it and I said well how much does that one have they had next this was in their booth
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.900]   where they had their their self-driving testing vehicle and they said a lot more than that
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:14.900]   they didn't even know.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.060]   150,000 is not that much really.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.060]   That's true 150,000.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.340]   Windows is what a 50 million or 150 million so it's a huge amount.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:26.460]   So there's two things here there's of course electric vehicles which are that's being
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:33.220]   furthered by federal regulation and new emissions rules I mean that's really being pushed but
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.780]   then there's also autonomy and in some it's interesting you mentioned Nevada Jason because
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.420]   in some ways state governments are really mixed a mixed bag on this.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.740]   Nevada is kind of very autonomous friendly.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.020]   California just made a rule that said that autonomous vehicles not only have to have
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:52.340]   a steering wheel a gas pedal and a brake pedal but a driver in the car who's licensed
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.100]   to drive an autonomous vehicle they've made it very difficult.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.180]   There's a lot more people in California too right Nevada is a lot.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:03.220]   Yeah so big deal if Nevada is self-driving cars big deal you know what you really want
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:07.780]   is urban air at my opinion is urban areas we talked yesterday about this on the new
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:14.780]   screensavers with Sam Abu some aid who's a longtime automotive watcher he writes about
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:20.100]   automotive technology for Nav again he's an analyst and he was the opinion I thought
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.260]   I'm interested what you guys think of this that the way that autonomous vehicles are
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.580]   going to happen but they're going to happen in an interesting and unique way that urban
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:33.620]   areas he said you know in London you already have a kind of a no drive zone we have to
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.660]   pay extra to drive in this area he said what's going to happen Singapore too what's going
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.940]   to happen in these very dense urban areas is you're going to have an autonomous vehicle
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.940]   zone because a real problem with autonomous vehicles is not the cars the software it's
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.900]   the humans driving the other cars.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.740]   So he said what's going to happen is you're going to have autonomous only areas you'll
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.020]   arrive at the edge of this area get out of your car and an Uber or a Lyft or something
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.820]   will arrive to pick you up and you'll and that's what you'll use to navigate these urban
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.700]   areas that makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.860]   It's totally agree with that.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.860]   Go ahead Serenity.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.860]   Sorry yeah.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.340]   No it's heightened public transit in a way except we're all going to be paying for it
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.100]   it's essentially like taking a bus or taking a train except for the fact that now it may
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.740]   either be your car that's autonomous or you may be restricted to again a park and ride
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.700]   but instead of you you know you're parking your car instead of getting on a train you're
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.420]   getting into an Uber or you're getting into a Lyft or you're getting into an Apple car
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:37.100]   or a Google car I can absolutely see that happening and I'm actually not opposed to
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.540]   regulation like I'm not opposed to California's regulations at present time because when we
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.180]   think about what what autonomous vehicles look like at the present day including stuff
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.940]   like the what Tesla's testing with the Model S we're not in a position where I think anybody
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.980]   feels comfortable having completely autonomous vehicles on the road that don't have gas pedals
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.380]   they can't it's gonna be a challenge for me to get in a living room on wheels and let
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.220]   it drive me somewhere it's gonna be a scary moment that first time not so scary in a congested
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.780]   urban area where it's not going very fast and everything else is autonomous that's almost
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.380]   like you like getting in a train or getting in a monorail or something it's not that's
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.380]   not as scary.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.740]   Yeah, as a tiny that's really easy to imagine I mean I feel like Ubers presence in New York
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:27.740]   is I mean it's everywhere everyone is using Uber everyone I know is using Uber several
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.740]   times a week.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.660]   There's some by the way there's some argument that all these extra cars on the road is
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.380]   one of the reasons why New York congestion is gotten worse not better.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.940]   Oh yeah of course right.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:36.940]   When you can't believe it.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.100]   The implications of big data if you have a lot of autonomous vehicles cooperating with
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:48.380]   each other, definitely decrease and yeah I mean right now you know Uber is basically
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.780]   door to door service right.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.780]   So if I wanted to get to my office to get ready for this podcast taking an Uber from
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:02.660]   my door at my apartment to my door at the office and you know in the future.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.260]   Already by the way it's probably cheaper for you to do that than to own a car right.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.900]   Oh I think in the city.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.900]   Of course.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.020]   The car ownership is very expensive in New York City because you have to park you have
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.020]   to insurance.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.420]   Yeah and insurance is higher than anywhere in the world in King's County and so in the
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.620]   state I mean but yeah so I think for you know a lot of people that are already working
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:33.740]   in the city using Uber regularly it's obvious because they're you know companies are already
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.420]   tracking this traffic information and they're using it in services like Google Maps and
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:47.300]   in Uber and other software and so you know I guess my version of the future is exactly
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.180]   that or sort of what I see is exactly that but just without the driver you know instead
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.700]   of having these small talk conversations with people that have been driving for years.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.340]   Yeah I don't want to.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.340]   Uber.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.340]   No driver please.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:05.140]   You know in the future I'll be able to just read the magazine or relax or just do something
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.140]   fun.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.020]   You know a woman you might feel safer in a driverless vehicle really.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:15.380]   Yeah I mean there is some a real advantage to being picked up at say you know 11 or 12
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.780]   at night and not having to get into a car with a strange guy.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.740]   The point yeah well when I when I'm in San Francisco you know Uber is pretty much a necessity
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:28.820]   if you're if you're getting around and you're a guest in San Francisco or a taxi.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:34.100]   But lately I've actually requested like the black cars as opposed to Uber X's just because
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:39.300]   it you know they're usually licensed licensed livery companies so it's a little bit it's
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.740]   a little bit more uh for us of a safety thing.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.580]   But Uber is interesting to me you know I heard a fact I wish I knew the origin of this and
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.380]   I can't so it's I don't have the the data on it but I was in a conversation with a friend
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.460]   who who told me that Uber makes a map of the city every time it drives around in seven
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.540]   seconds at the beginning of 2015 and they're trying to get that down to four.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.540]   Wow.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:07.340]   And like when you think about how fast like how fast being able to map a city when you
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.700]   have that many cars on the road and what that might mean for autonomy and working with
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.300]   working with roads it's just it's incredible.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.300]   Exactly.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.380]   And it's the private company that are gathering all of this information.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.260]   You don't forget you know Waze is another big company that has a lot of traffic information
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.900]   and all of this is going into the hands of private companies that have business interest
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.820]   in lowering traffic and getting people to their point of destination faster.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:39.100]   So I think that you know the it's just an infrastructure issue I think the technology
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.140]   on the technology side like it's all there.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.180]   Our GPUs are fast enough to process this information.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:49.220]   There have been live demonstrations of autonomous vehicles for several years now and they're
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.340]   only going to get better.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.860]   So I think you know the price has to come down for the average consumer and obviously
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.380]   they have to start making these things for everyone to buy but for all but that's what's
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.380]   interesting.
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.500]   I think it may also be the end of personal car ownership ultimately right.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   Well it would be a luxury.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.500]   It's a luxury yeah.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.020]   It would be a huge luxury.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.420]   I mean the when I talked to the automakers they said actually what we what we started
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.380]   this conversation with which is that the first place you're going to see these as
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.340]   in fleets that they're going to be really expensive.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:24.660]   They're not going to be meant for average consumers to start with unless you're you
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.260]   know a Tesla owner or something.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.100]   I'm thinking this might be the last car I ever buy.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.500]   I mean it very well could be you know partly because I'm really old.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.580]   They won't let me drive a car in a few years.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:42.980]   But it makes absolute sense for them to be to deploy them in fleets especially in urban
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.980]   areas.
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.140]   I think that that's kind of underlining that though and what Michael said is and every
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.740]   time I've talked to autonomous experts including a few years ago a Google guy they've told
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.780]   me we the technology is there that's not the problem.
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:00.860]   It's psychological it's governmental you know there are other issues but this is we've
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.260]   got the we've got the technology to do this.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.020]   Yeah Honda was talking about when I met with them last year they were talking about this
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:14.020]   vision that they had for this in commuter areas.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.820]   These super fast lanes with autonomous vehicles that sense each other they could go 100 to
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:25.580]   120 miles an hour and they would they own but only autonomous vehicles could go in there.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:30.060]   Humans the reaction times not fast enough right but but that people would be able to
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:35.700]   commute they felt like you know up to 150 to 200 miles a day.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.220]   If we could have you know that kind of infrastructure in place.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.100]   Predictions anybody how soon is this all going to happen.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:49.660]   Is it in the next decade is it in 20 years 50 years five years five years four to five.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.980]   You agree Michael I would say I totally disagree I think it's going to take up to 10 years I
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.620]   mean the product cycles on these cars are ridiculous the fact that the gesture control
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:04.100]   is obnoxious in my opinion that's something that's been available and the Xbox you know
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.380]   and we and and you want to drive your car like in minority report like.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.060]   I do gestures in my car but I don't think they would help drive.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.780]   They're going to be all the road in 2016 in a number of states they're going to be on
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.780]   the road.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.540]   I mean there's no they are I think I think it's soon I think it's really always hard
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.300]   with technology to predict this is one thing I think is sooner than you think partly because
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.260]   insurance companies but also the number of deaths road deaths now thousands of road deaths
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.140]   to the thirty three thousand a year in the US.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.620]   Yeah this is this is going to be a bigger and bigger issue.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:43.020]   I mean I think that once the the tech is going to be here without a doubt in five years I
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:49.020]   think what's going to dictate what happens in cities and what happens in rural areas is
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:55.780]   largely based on how they can how they can show regulators that the tech is a safe be
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.660]   can make the moral decisions of like let's say I'm coming around a cliff don't get the
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.660]   moral.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.260]   No like that's the that's the scary part right.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.500]   You're going on a cliff a kid walks in front of you do you save the tiny human and go off
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:13.220]   the cliff and die or do you kill the tiny human and save yourself like that's a that's
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.820]   a moral dilemma that unfortunately it's really hard for a car to.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.100]   Yeah exactly exactly and those those kinds of things granted that's an that's an obscure
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.300]   case and we're talking about a rural situation here but that's still those are the kinds of
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.260]   things that regulators have to think about when they're when they're saying yes we will
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.020]   allow autonomous cars everywhere because air everywhere means you know does the the random
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.340]   remote rural areas will happen everywhere but I think that I will be writing a Thomas vehicle
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.500]   in a in an urban and cadet congested urban area in the next five years I think.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.500]   Oh I am I absolutely believe it especially if you're going to San Francisco.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.460]   Yeah I think San Francisco Manhattan.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.460]   Yep.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.460]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.460]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.700]   All right let's take a break we'll come back with more we haven't we've that's just one
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:03.380]   story from CES per maybe I guess the most important story but there's VR goggles and segues
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.660]   and all sorts of stuff to talk about we've got a great panel to do it to Michael Nunez
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.340]   is joining us for the very first time for popular science magazine is there technology
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.620]   editor great to have you Michael you fit right in.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:22.740]   You're just a natural also sir and he called well our favorite roller derby artist explainer
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:28.140]   of all things Macintosh at imore.com I didn't know you were is this new managing editor that's
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.140]   here is that a new time.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.340]   I've always I've always been the managing editor of iOS and when we reduced staff a little
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.740]   bit and rejiggered I'm now the official the whole man.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.580]   Jig editor and Renee is the editor in chief.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.580]   Yep.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.580]   Wow.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.180]   Renee is editor in chief slash editor at large and is also working with some of the overarching
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.180]   stuff and mobilizations.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.380]   Oh you know what that means he's on the Jason Snell career path.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.380]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.380]   Oh yeah.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.180]   I mean if you didn't know that about Renee Richie already.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.260]   All right now I understand but that's good for you sir entity get that get that dead wood
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.980]   out of the way.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:06.860]   And also with us Jason Hunter who is an editor in chief at tech republic and did see okay
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:12.300]   this might be politically charged for you did see net give up the best of CES to engage
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.020]   it this year I think they did.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.860]   That was last year last year.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:24.300]   Last year yeah because AOL spends a lot of money on CES and of course in gadgets AOL.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.300]   Big lobby studio.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:31.260]   They remember they own tech crunch as well and they had they had huge studios for both.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.300]   This was the biggest that I've ever seen them have.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:38.260]   And the irony is and of course it makes sense because it's AOL CES is less and less relevant
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:43.460]   every year but their coverage bigger and bigger.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.260]   Seen that had huge coverage too.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:52.060]   Seen that was just all over everything and they still have a bigger stage than I don't
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:57.060]   know.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:03.100]   I have to say I feel like especially in this modern age with the internet and companies
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.700]   doing their own thing these big trade shows don't have long for this world and yet CES
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.700]   seems to buck that trend.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.700]   I don't know why.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.700]   Yeah it does.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.700]   I would say it was busier this year than it was last year.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.700]   I understand.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.140]   You know there are a lot of haters out there and that's a CES is irrelevant but I would
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.940]   say it's a lot of fun but you are going to see things like gesture controls and cars
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.540]   and virtual reality headsets and you know a lot of different augmented reality headsets.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.380]   And so if you're able to see all of that you should be able to make determinations about
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.380]   when to expect you know all of this stuff to hit consumers.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.380]   And so for me it's hugely helpful.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.380]   Okay.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.380]   Fair enough.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.380]   I still find it useful.
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.020]   There's a lot of noise and a lot of useless stuff but there's but there's also a lot of
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.020]   vision for you know road maps for where.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.620]   And then the place you can go to kind of see it all right.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.620]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.620]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.620]   Which is the worst part of it too.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.980]   Because there's so much you can't see it all.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.980]   Right.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.660]   And when it comes to TVs you have to see it in person.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.860]   You can't judge whether HDR for instance is going to make a difference unless you see
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.820]   a good HDR screen in person.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.100]   Pictures of pictures don't really mean anything.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.100]   Right.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.460]   The cool thing about CES to me is it always feels a little bit Walt Disney-ish.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.660]   It always feels like World of Tomorrow.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.420]   Let's go to the Expo World.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.700]   There aren't you know World's Fairs don't exist anymore.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.180]   They're kind of an old world thing.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.020]   But CES very much feels like a World's Fair to me.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:28.540]   Where all of the best and brightest you know the best and brightest of technology from
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:33.740]   big giant companies to little bitty places in Shenzhen all come together and like here
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.380]   here's what we have here's what we've been playing with.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.980]   And of course there are companies that don't go to the shows anymore but they have their
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:43.020]   own events and it's very it's very easy to find out you know what Apple's doing next.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.420]   Because Apple will let you know when it's ready to announce something.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.420]   Right.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:51.980]   But if you want to cut you know if you want a wide swath of like what's going what are
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.340]   the trends in home automation what are the trends in cars this year what are the trends
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:01.540]   in television it's a it's a really good show to get trends and just see goofy stuff.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.980]   Like there's a last year when I was there there were so many robots so many adorable
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.060]   robots that I was just like you know I may never have any of these in my house but I'm
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.260]   so glad that I get to walk them walk among rows of rows of like really ridiculous robots
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:22.260]   and like see a see a R2D2 that can also be a a beer fridge like yeah that's the stuff
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.780]   that makes me think I don't care.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.180]   I don't mind missing this.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.780]   I made robot friends I made some friends with some robots.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.180]   You like the robots though I've seen you shaking hands with asthma.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.540]   I do I do like the robots.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.180]   We're gonna take a break come back please those of you just returning from C.S. do not
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.820]   listen to this next commercial it might put you to sleep.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.380]   The rest of you I want to tell you about my mattress.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:50.500]   Casper mattress not only did I sleep when I cast for mattress I slept on Casper pillows
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:56.460]   last night they sent me some pillows as a I guess a Christmas gift I don't know man I'm
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.460]   in heaven.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.460]   So jealous.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:05.460]   Oh they're nice Casper is an online retailer premium mattresses made in the USA and because
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.700]   they don't have showrooms it's a fraction of the cost they actually come to you in a box
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:15.780]   really surprisingly small box you open it up and you're got a mattress combining latex
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.620]   and memory foam now I almost don't want to say that because I think sometimes people
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.900]   have preconceived notions from experiences with other mattresses.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:28.780]   The way they've done it is amazing it's cool it's not it breathes it's not too shmushy
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.620]   but it's not too firm it's really you got to try it and the nice thing is you can for
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:38.220]   a hundred days risk free you could buy it online.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.220]   They'll send it to you in that nice box you open it up you put it on your bed if you feel
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:48.140]   nervous to keep your old mattress around and anytime in that first hundred days you call
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.180]   them if you don't like it you call them and say take it back a career comes they take
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:55.700]   it back they actually donated to a local charity and you're back to where you were at no cost
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.300]   to you they refund every penny but that's just I think to reassure people because you're
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.180]   not going to do that you're going to love this thing.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.660]   This is so much better than trying a bed in a showroom sleep on it.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:13.300]   Casper mattresses $500 for a twin their biggest mattress the king size 950 bucks compare that
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:18.100]   to a premium mattress at the mattress door down the street you'll see this is a very
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:23.300]   good deal and it's even less if you use the offer code TWIT at Casper.com/Twit will take
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:31.060]   50 bucks off any mattress some terms and conditions to apply find out more Casper CAS P-E-R dot
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:40.340]   com slash terms I don't know what they're putting in those pillows but they are phenomenal
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.180]   I need to try them really you want to I can get you that I can listen yet pillow I don't
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:50.140]   know about the mattress I got the I got the mattress yeah I have that I have the crazy
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.980]   story about the mattress where we came back from vacation and the cat had gotten locked
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:59.420]   in our in our bedroom and peed all over our old mattress oh we had we had guests coming
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.940]   so I actually like I was like well we were looking at a Casper anyway hey Casper yeah
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.780]   any way that I can get this in like 40 hours because I have a guest coming and I would like

[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.380]   mattress aren't they the greatest they're just they're pretty nice service nice people
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.860]   I get a cat story for you we went on as you know we were gone for a week on a cruise and
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:27.980]   day one of the crews we get a call from Lisa's nephews watching the house the cats disappeared
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.900]   and and we spent the whole crews worried about the cat cat they never found the cat that
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:38.820]   we put up posters everywhere we got back no cat Lisa was going Lisa is a dedicated cat
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:47.420]   owner my wife she went out every night every day looking kitty kitty and so like Wednesday
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:52.540]   she hears some meowing the cat is on the neighbor's roof he's been on she's been on the neighbor's
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.260]   roof for 10 days couldn't figure out how to get down the neighbor said yeah we heard
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:04.940]   meowing we couldn't she survived though even though pouring torrential rains and I don't
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:10.140]   know cats are kind of interesting critters so I know that's I sympathize with your stories
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:17.260]   or any they can get everywhere she's now an indoor cat I might have yeah no not going out
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:23.900]   Lisa's decided oh she's she's a dumb cat some cats will not go places they can't get
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.700]   back from this one no it's not her first time she got locked in the neighbor's garage earlier
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:36.940]   all right moving on CES open open now open panel what else did you see it's CES let me start with
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:43.260]   you Michael since you're our our virgin what else did you see that was worth noting at CES this week
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:51.820]   um wow big question I would say by far and away my favorite part of CES was trying out the new
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:57.420]   virtual reality headsets so there are three major ones obviously Oculus one from Sony that
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:03.100]   connects to the PlayStation and then HTC's making one with the gaming company Valy
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:09.740]   yeah called the Vive correct and and so it was great to try all those out and see how they
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:16.860]   how they compared against each other basically and to see where are there were some excel
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:22.700]   them where others didn't and you know all three will be released later this year which is exciting
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:28.300]   and I think it's going to be a pretty big deal among gamers maybe not for the average consumer
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.580]   but anyone that's playing first person shooters on an Xbox one or a PlayStation is going to want
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:39.500]   to try gaming at the next level which is in virtual reality I was a little disappointed because
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.460]   a couple things happened first of all I saw that announcement the Oculus Rift was available
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:50.540]   I think a little more than we expected 599 yeah yeah I mean their CEO said or not CEO founder
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:55.740]   one of the founders Palmer left he said 350 yeah last year little expensive and then they also
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.060]   mentioned that the touch which I think is fairly important and people who've used it say it is
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.860]   not till the end of the year that's delayed now and I tried all my Windows PCs none of them
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.980]   are smart are powerful enough for the Oculus Rift so now I not only have a 599 Rift
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:19.660]   but I'm gonna we're gonna build a PC we're gonna build a PC for at least a grand
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.940]   at least a grand we're gonna actually make us kind of top we're gonna make the ultimate VR gaming
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:31.020]   machine or of Ruger nice overgrown because we used to do a ghost remember on the on the screen
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:37.260]   saver so we're gonna build that and then after all that I found out I could have gotten a free one
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:42.460]   I damn getting a free one because I kick started way back when and actually pray a little a little
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:49.500]   pat on the back to Oculus for doing this yeah 20,000 or whatever early adopters who kicked in money
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.700]   it kick started before Facebook bought him and and I was one of them we'll all be getting a free
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.380]   Oculus Rift so that's nice so now I have two
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:05.420]   Hey if you want to use it twice well there's social VR too don't forget you know you can have
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:10.860]   a friend join you that's what I'm thinking do not ever be in the same room with a person
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.460]   and have one of these heads why not because you can smash each other
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:20.300]   jork yeah and you run into each other look at yes these things were everywhere and the worst was
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:26.220]   Samsung had this big theater with with full of it I have a photo of it yeah I saw that on Instagram
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:32.780]   and it was like when I posted it I was like this will never make you put on VR headset it reminded
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:41.260]   me a lot of the pictures you saw in the 50s of people in 3D theaters wearing those stupid red
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:46.620]   and green glasses it's even worse too but because you see people like they're looking around and
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:53.740]   they're looking up and then they're like oh it's like I mean you just look ridiculous when you're
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.260]   when you're wearing one of these things and you see people like taking videos and they're you
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:03.180]   know playing the games and everything I mean it it's just socially they are not meant to be used
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:09.980]   in company I think only online company virtual company unless they make one I also treated this
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.660]   like on the last day of CES one thing that was clear to me was like these things are not meant
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:19.020]   to be using company unless they make one that looks like a dafpunk helmet
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:28.860]   then I'll man then you really will be up all night to get lucky a little dafpunk humor there
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.100]   of the three that you tried Michael did you have a favorite
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:40.700]   um yeah so I've been following these pretty closely over the past year and I would say the new HTC
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:47.500]   VIVE pre the second generation of their developer kit was the most impressive they added this front
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:53.260]   facing camera to the VR headset so there's an element of mixed reality basically if you
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.900]   were playing in your living room and there was coffee table in front of you or a chair or
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:03.500]   anything else that you wouldn't want to bump into the VR headset would would show you virtually
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.060]   I like that that you're getting near it yeah so it makes it a lot more accessible to people and
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:14.940]   also because of the that has that headset also has spatial recognition so you you mount these little
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:20.940]   these little IR blasters basically and it's tracking your movement within the room so you can walk
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.340]   around you can grab things in the virtual world and you don't have to worry about bumping into
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:31.180]   furniture or anything that you wouldn't want to knock over and obviously their partnership with
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:37.260]   Valve makes it really attractive to a guy like me because Valve makes some of the best video
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.260]   games in the world and they're one of the best gaming distribution platforms in the world and I
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:48.140]   think that partnership matter a lot going forward especially once people start sinking like $1200
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:54.140]   into their VR machines and are going to want the most powerful and most immersive experience so
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:40:01.020]   that was my conclusion you like to survive the best too yeah yeah our our actually our we have a
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:09.980]   a writer and editor Aaron Carson who's been writing about VR for all year has tested all of them
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:17.020]   recently was at HTC at their headquarters up in Seattle and tested the recent one and then
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:22.700]   tested the new one they released at CES has you know tested all of them and her her conclusion is
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:29.660]   the same as it technically in terms of the technology the vibe is the best one it's a frame rate hand
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:35.100]   controllers I don't think it's frame rate I think it's it's content I think it's also controllers
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:42.220]   on their controller they have the controllers like the the ones that like the touch controllers the
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:47.420]   the the oculus ones but they already have them they're going to come out when the when the device
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.900]   comes out in the first half of the year and she said they're easier to use she's you know tested
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.740]   the the half moon controllers the ones that you're talking about the touch controllers
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:01.340]   and she said they're much more complicated to use there's a lot more buttons there's a lot more
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:08.540]   going on there and also you know this is kind of what we care about obviously is is not the just
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:14.380]   uses for gaming but the uses for all kinds of other things training and presentations
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:20.860]   yeah but isn't it gaming that's going to just propel this forward I mean really the gamers are
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:27.500]   the ones are going to spend 500 600 bucks on this as an accessory isn't that really worth will to
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.980]   I mean right enterprise will to if it's getting you into you actually saw this at CES there was a
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.220]   there was a couple of these smart home companies that it was really hard especially like it show
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:42.300]   stoppers and the little shows the shows outside the shows to show off their whole product but they
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.580]   gave you a VR headset and then that showed their product and it was actually quite effective
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:53.020]   and so for uses like that I think you're going to see also health care is all over this education
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:42:00.860]   is all over this there's a lot of potential uses for these things and HTC is is playing that game
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:06.140]   better they're off to a better start than Oculus they're really looking at they're taking that I
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.100]   think more seriously than what Oculus Oculus is which they're really focused on gaming which is what
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:15.020]   you know palmer lucky and those guys have been focused on at the beginning is really the hardcore
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:21.180]   gamer so from that same point I think HTC has a lot of potential too obviously HTC as a company
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:28.060]   has some troubles and it's not as good of a patron for this for the vibe as as facebook is for
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:34.140]   Oculus so you have to keep that in mind as well. VIVE was the best gaming project a product at
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:40.780]   CES according to Engadget the VIVE chaperone what's the chaperone is that it so the chaperone is
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:45.180]   what I described as the feature that prevents you from bumping into things in your late in the
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:50.780]   room so that's chaperone sort of comes into the game it doesn't fully remove you from your virtual
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:57.580]   world. I like that but watch the table yeah watch out for the table yeah I mean it's a serious
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:03.820]   problem when you're asking people to set aside room for you know most people don't have a room
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:07.260]   that they can dedicate to virtual reality so they're going to be playing them in their living rooms
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:13.180]   and to accommodate for that is a smart move and and just back to this gaming versus enterprise
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:19.580]   thing I mean I think there will be of course enterprise use cases for a lot of VR headsets but
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:24.140]   for the most part I think you're going to see augmented reality and mixed reality making use of
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:31.180]   I'm sorry used in a lot of enterprise settings and for productivity I think virtual reality because
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:36.940]   it's so immersive and because it removes you from the room I think in a lot of cases you're going to see
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:42.060]   them used for entertainment so whether it's watching a movie and feeling like you're the only guy in
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:50.460]   the theater or or you know in a war zone in a first-person shooter or even just you know light drawing
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:55.100]   you know which is a really fun thing to do in the vibe because you can walk around your drawing and
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:01.180]   see it in 3d oh wow and that type of stuff is really exciting but again you know those are all
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:06.540]   entertain those are all forms of entertainment they're not you know they haven't really demonstrated
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:11.820]   how you might use this to practice surgery or something and of course that will be available
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:17.980]   but I think what I have seen is like a lot of a lot of big companies are more interested in
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:27.100]   translucent displays that allow you to merge digital information with real-world information so you
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.820]   know if you're performing surgery let's say you might have digital information overlaid on
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:37.900]   on your practice dummy or on a human or you know as you're as you're watching someone do surgery
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:43.100]   whereas VR it's just because of the controllers and because of some of the limitations
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:49.020]   with how you use your hands and how you interact with the virtual environments I think for the most
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:54.620]   case there there's a limitation there you just won't see a lot of productivity uses for
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:45:03.420]   these VR headsets and certainly social VR training and yeah exactly you'll see it but yeah I agree
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:09.260]   AR is the bigger opportunity and we saw that at CES 2 Sony has AR glasses enterprise glasses
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:16.220]   epsin some other companies is Microsoft holo holo lens not there though right
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:22.060]   Microsoft no they weren't there they weren't even demos yeah yeah they showed their most recent
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.140]   iteration of the Holo lens they don't go to see their previous no no they've stopped going to
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:33.100]   CES and I yeah the Holo lens isn't ready yet either yeah hey okay so I asked Michael Jason your
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:38.220]   pick anything for at CES besides VR and electric vehicles what else
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:46.380]   Jason I'll let you answer this one yeah Jason this is for Jason yeah cool yeah so how about TVs
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:52.700]   do you see any TVs you really liked no I look I said this while I was giving some tours at CES and
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.420]   of course that's the thing everybody wants to ask about because that's what you think about when
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:01.420]   you think it's yes and I said look if you're in the market for a TV do not buy a 4k don't even
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:07.740]   know right now there's no content and there's no standard exactly there's no content there's no
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.180]   say it's gonna be two years before it's really a thing you know who wants to watch House of Cards
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:19.100]   in 4k anyway right it's like it's not a great that's one of the only really great shows in 4k
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:26.220]   and it's not something that's well suited to it right so yeah I think the TVs were cool like HDR
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:31.100]   4k they look as good they look you know incrementally better than they did last year but it's kind of
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:37.100]   hard to get excited about it because it's just going nowhere for for a little while still so no I
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:42.700]   wasn't really excited about the TVs I thought one of the things and obviously this is a hazard
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:49.020]   because of you know the stuff that I focus on but I really did think that more and more the stuff
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:56.300]   behind the scenes that's that's powering these is is amazing the things like the the data and the
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:04.060]   AI and the stuff deep learning that's powering all these experiences you know CES is it's finally
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.540]   kind of caught up with this is that it's more about experiences and it's more about
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:14.380]   it's more about what you can do with the technology what the technology does for me or does for my
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:21.340]   community or does for society because you know it's not just about to see this is still a gadget
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:25.500]   show it's still a hardware show and there's cool stuff you see but more and more you know I
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.460]   think the great example is Intel you go to Intel's booth you'd be hard pressed even find a PC there
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.660]   right so that interesting wow yeah you couldn't even find a PC in that booth it was
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:41.340]   Intel still go to CES Apple and Microsoft don't why does Intel go yeah well I think Intel
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:48.460]   partly because Intel chips are powering more and more of these things right and they want to be
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.860]   mobile they're not in mobile yet they'd like to be there yeah they're getting there I think
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:48:00.940]   and and they know that their future and they have a brilliant future in the car in home automation
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:08.060]   in you know the smart smart devices and intelligence embedding itself in every bit of these
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:14.780]   of these things every bit of society I will I will say this about TVs I was talking with Scott
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:21.100]   Wilkinson our home theater guy who of course is horse and and foot sore from 25 miles this
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:27.100]   week at CES and mostly I was looking at TVs the good news is the UHD Alliance did release a
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:34.380]   standard called ultra HD premium that includes encompasses the broader game color range
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:40.380]   broader color gamut and encompasses HDR at least provides a standard that you should be looking for
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:46.380]   the Blu-ray Alliance has announced a UHD premium Blu-ray player 500 bucks not bad
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:53.980]   so and movie companies have said there'll be a hundred titles in 2016 available for this UHD
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:49:00.700]   premium so we're making some progress and at least we we all want it I want it I love for
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:07.980]   God but I've been for 10 years I saw the first 4k TV at CES 10 years ago and from then on I said
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:16.220]   this is what this is what I forget 3d I want 4k even 3d right like a really 4k looks more 3d than 3d
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:20.700]   because it's not gimmick you can see the contrast you can see the edges of things they really pop
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:25.660]   out but there's no content so somebody in the chair said well if my TV died today wouldn't I
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:33.900]   want to buy a 4k TV no no even today get a cheap good cheap HD TV you can get it on a
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:39.340]   amazing TV right yeah you can get an amazing TV to grand you can get a brilliant 75 inch TV
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:45.020]   exactly and then in two years these 4k TVs are going to be obsolete especially with the stuff
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:50.540]   that we saw at CES this year with HDR and other things these ones here are going to look like puppies
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:55.420]   you know in in a couple years so that's what exactly what I told people if you're in the market
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:02.300]   you got to get a TV now get a really great you know 1080p TV right for between 500 and a thousand
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:07.020]   dollars you get amazing you know screen because everybody's pushing 4k and in a couple of years
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:14.300]   baby LG's OLEDs the OLED ultra HD premium TVs will be affordable yeah it's more affordable
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:21.580]   so that was cool they look good the things that I liked was the the rollable screen from LG
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:26.860]   that's wild yeah also the glass there there were there were two I saw one from Panasonic and one
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:32.300]   from LG where it was just glass right the whole screen was glass LG did this thing where the whole
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:38.940]   screen was just a glass as thick as four credit cards and clear glass wow and then all of the
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:43.420]   electronics and the speaker was in the base of the the thing and if you hang it on your wall that
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:49.660]   base kind of folds under a little bit you know and so that was beautiful I thought and very cool
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:54.540]   and then Panasonic had one where it was just on a bookshelf I posted a video of this I think on
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:51:00.460]   Instagram where it was just a bookshelf and the over part of the bookshelf was this piece of glass
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:05.900]   and it was a screen over top of it and at times it was opaque and at times it was clear where you
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:14.300]   could see what was behind it and it was uh it was super cool yeah I uh I enjoyed that a lot I thought
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:18.940]   that was a neat um a neat thing that was really impressive because the 4k as much as I like 4k as
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:24.780]   much as you know you all like 4k um I mean most people I know regular humans can barely tell the
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.620]   difference between SD and HD right they're still watching SD channels and you're like turn that
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:35.500]   thing to the HD I know why are you why are you watching the SD version of this show you could
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:41.020]   watch the Golden Globes in HD you know that looks fine to me but but I think a lot of people are
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:45.740]   actually vastly underestimating how quickly 4k will become available to people so there might not
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:51.580]   be a lot of 4k content right now but don't forget GoPros are shooting the 4k YouTube is accepting it
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:56.460]   and trying to create more 4k content Netflix will be creating all its original series and
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:02.620]   in 4k so like I think that uh that you know maybe right at the second there's not a lot of content
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:07.660]   but I don't think it will take very long for um for that content to come out and and sure like
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:13.180]   House of Cards is a little dated and not all of that exciting uh anymore but there will be a new
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:18.860]   Netflix show that you're going to want to watch in 4k and so but really well streaming 4k be
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:23.820]   anything great no because they're not getting out of it don't they yeah they're gonna have
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:28.860]   do we have gigabit ethernet it's a non-starter it's just going to slow down your internet to
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:33.020]   a crawl and it's going to be too compressed for you to really tell the difference did either of
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:41.980]   you take a ride in the one-man drone quadcopter oh my goodness no pretty wild though no pretty wild
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.060]   it's called the e-hang yeah I don't know if that's a great name
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:51.580]   and whatever you do don't step out of it until the rotors stop
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:53:00.460]   yeah it just doesn't seem very very well thought out um but it was pretty cool and I guess in theory
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:06.620]   is is interesting but yeah I'm not going to be steps I think like that we're there any were there
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:14.300]   any little drones worth mentioning anything new you know DJI I think is is way ahead of the trends
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:20.220]   and a lot of these um they've got a lot of his good drone innovations and they released a new
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:27.580]   drone ready 4k camera I think and and you know some of the controlling apparatuses are a little
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:32.540]   easier and better but for the most part you're seeing the same the same approach to a lot of these
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:38.700]   drones they're all quadcopters and they may or may not have a camera um and it's at this point
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:43.500]   it's just a lot of it's about control whether it's partially autonomous or fully autonomous and
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.380]   you know what how the camera connects to the drone and whether it's on a gimbal that can be
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:55.340]   fitted with an icon or a cannon or just DJI special camera and so um you know I think DJI is ahead
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:59.020]   of everyone because they make it it's sort of a modular design they make it pretty easy to swap
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:04.140]   those things in and out but uh but yeah I mean a lot of the drones are you know have four propellers
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:11.020]   and yeah can fly relatively high yeah and good cameras and blah blah blah you covered a little
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:15.180]   bit the wearables the wearable scene of course what you'd expect wearables including this which
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:22.460]   is wild the HTC Under Armour health box yeah this one was pretty interesting um you know not a lot
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:30.940]   of these in the back but um but you know it's just it's a it's a scale uh activity tracker and a
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:36.540]   heart rate monitor all in a box yeah exactly right yeah so I think up until this point you know a
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:42.860]   lot of people associated fit bit with the health tracker pull a uh pull R with the heart rate monitor
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.780]   and then I think with ease might have a smart scale under armors gotten very aggressive in this
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:53.340]   yeah definitely I mean they see I think they have to be they want to compete against the top
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:58.700]   American sports brands Adidas and Nike and um this is definitely one way to do it so there are
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.260]   three different companies that that worked on this particular package it's being marketed under
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:09.100]   Under Armour but HTC designed all of the hardware and then actually they worked with a consulting group
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:14.620]   um I believe it's called Wolfgang Mueller to to identify this as something that people would want
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:20.460]   and I think they're correct to do so I mean as I said these products exist um and with other
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:25.660]   companies but they're not all within the same ecosystem and so um for the really like fitness
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:33.580]   crazy um a very active type of person that that wants the full spectrum of of um of health
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:38.140]   information at their fingertips I think um Under Armour and HTC have done a pretty good job of
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:43.020]   uh at least packaging it well I wouldn't say this is yeah technological uh technological breakthrough
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:47.900]   by any means all of this stuff has existed for several years it's all one but the data the data
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:53.100]   on the back end is because it's actually powered by IBM Watson and so oh you weren't joking when
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:56:00.700]   you said Watson serenity you met it it's powered by Watson on the back end and so I'm sorry Dave
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:07.180]   you're dead this advanced analytics uh on your so so it tells you sort of how you're doing and it
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:13.340]   has this essential virtual coach and virtual trainer don't eat that hot dog Dave that uh that it's
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:18.940]   showing you it's triangulating all your data sources uh and then it gives you so that UA
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:24.940]   UA record I think is the the name of the app you can use that now even without their health box
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:29.900]   um and that will power so you can use it with your other uh Under Armour has been on an
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:37.820]   acquisition spree on apps uh health uh and tracker apps yes they really I think want to be the place
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:42.460]   for all of this they bought my fitness pal it's interesting it's gonna be them and run
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:47.420]   tastic probably it'll be the two big software companies how about Fitbit I thought this Fitbit
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:53.740]   blaze the fact I pre-ordered immediately 200 dollars smartwatch uh with Fitbit technology uh
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:58.860]   in it uh serenity I know of course you're an Apple watch fan but uh this intrigue you it all
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:05.980]   does do notifications so it did intrigue me up to the point where some of my co-workers saw it in
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:13.660]   in the in person actually it's ugly it's ugly and it's big this is this is the thing that frustrates
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:21.180]   gps built into it it does not it has assisted gps oh that's it has assisted gps so that's
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:27.420]   confusing like this well it says connected gps well that's an apple watch has connected gps exactly
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:32.460]   yeah I was really excited because I love um I think the the folks behind Fitstar are doing some
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:37.580]   really great stuff um I have both of those apps fit stars built into this right yeah yeah it's
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.500]   a yeah uh they didn't I don't know if they've acquired or if they did partnership no I think
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:45.980]   they acquired them yeah they might have yeah but I mean Fitstar does some great stuff and and
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:52.300]   Fitbit does great stuff but right now it's just it's too it's too bulky it like it looks gigantic
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:57.020]   on a dude's wrist oh when you put it on a lady wrist it looks like you're wearing a giant cuff
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:02.140]   I mean you can yeah it reminds me of the original Samsung gear if you yeah that was too big too that
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:07.500]   was yeah it's it's almost identical okay I'll cancel my order it's yeah definitely cancel it I mean
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:12.460]   the thing that the problem the other problem with this is the best thing it has going for
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:16.780]   it is 200 bucks right it's basically like an apple watch for 200 bucks so good for them that's
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:22.140]   that's good um but the design one it looks too much like the apple watch and the apple watch is not
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:28.860]   all all that much of a looker by itself and I wear one um I wore Fitbits for a long time uh so
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:35.660]   I've been a fan of both um but the problem with it like the design is not good and um these things
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:42.380]   are still uh fitness you know has to be these things have to have some kind of style component
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:47.580]   if you're gonna wear it around all the time so I think this was an epic fail and you saw it when
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:55.180]   uh the the stock dropped uh 13% the same day and like I think 18% within 48 hours after the wisdom
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:02.780]   of the crowds yeah oh well my order is being shipped so I guess I'll be wearing that ships in
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:07.180]   March though wait a minute can I cancel as it says your order is in the process of being shipped
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:13.260]   maybe I can cancel it still any major of that can't mail them look at that cancel button can't
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:21.340]   please I don't want it I had serious guilt buying oh yeah I wasn't there on the other hand
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:27.820]   Samsung released uh their smartwatch that actually has 3g in it um which I thought was interesting can
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:35.900]   you write calls you don't have to pair it with uh with a device uh and so that's it you can pair
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:41.340]   it um but I was talking to somebody from Samsung and I was like well what about battery right
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:46.220]   everybody it's that everybody's gonna ask and uh he said well this was this was probably seven
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:51.100]   o'clock at night and he showed me you know where he was wearing one and he said I've been up since
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:56.540]   6 a.m. you know and I'm at about 40% battery life so he said people when saying they get two days
[00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:02.780]   out he said I don't get two days but oh yeah there it is Garris two classic um but uh but he
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:08.460]   was easily getting an awful day uh out of it and he said he's you know uses it a good deal he works
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:14.380]   out I like the ring that's the one with the ring uh interface I like I think the ring looks better
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:21.020]   it looks more classic watch now the 3g version is thicker because it has that radio in it so but
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:26.860]   it is small like um like Serenid was saying uh that some of these watches they're just you could
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:32.700]   not imagine um uh you know a woman wanting to wear one of these things they're so large this one
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:40.220]   actually is smaller it's smaller than the um than the previous uh gear watches it's also smaller than
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:45.340]   the Moto 360 which is a nice looking do you have to have a Samsung phone to use this or can you
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:52.300]   don't have to have a Samsung Samsung no no you don't you can um but you uh uh but it can do I think
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:56.220]   you might have to set it up with Andrew I should actually I should qualify that I think you might
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:00.300]   have to have Android to set it that's not a problem but the pre some of the previous Samsung watches
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:07.740]   required you owning a Samsung phone oh specifically a Samsung I don't I mean that doesn't I have a
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:15.020]   few Samsung phones lying around yeah I really like that but I think it runs on special Samsung
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:19.580]   software it's tizen right android where I know I'm sure it's tizen yeah it's tizen it's not in the
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:25.420]   other yeah yep yep it's customized you know I like I like what Samsung's been doing with the watches
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:30.380]   I think that it's in it's a different direction in some ways than what the Apple Watch is going
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:36.700]   and then very similar in others I still think it's a little too big but but they have at least
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:43.740]   been making strides I remember trying on I tried on the LG or Bain earlier this year as well as huge
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:49.900]   yeah well the urbane with the Moto 360 with the first Samsung gear and all of them I was wearing
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:55.980]   them up here to make them look remotely like they belong down my arm and even so I was just kind of
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:00.700]   like ugh it's hard right because you want to be able to put a certain amount of information on the
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:05.100]   watch and I'm you know I won't deny 38 millimeter like I'm wearing the 38 millimeter watch
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:08.860]   that's the little Apple Watch yeah this is the little Apple Watch and it fits my wrist well
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:14.780]   but there are definitely times where where the space crunch gets to my ability to actually interact
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.820]   with the watch it's a little harder to tap on than the 42 millimeter and some of the the gear watches
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:26.860]   I've used but I still like I got it there's got to be some way to for smaller risted folks ladies
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:31.420]   and dudes to be able to enjoy these without feeling like they have to wear it boyfriend style
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:35.100]   where it's just and that doesn't even work for health sensors because if you're gonna wear
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:41.580]   it that big the health dancers can't actually tap into to hear wrist data so I don't know I'm
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:50.940]   along those long those lines Huawei also released their new watch at CES the jewel which that actually
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:56.860]   there's two models the jewel and the elegant and they say that they were aiming these specifically
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:01.740]   at women that they were trying to make it smaller and they were trying to make it more have more
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:07.260]   style options available I still thought they were pretty big I still thought they were about the
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:14.620]   same size as the Samsung even though they had said that and so but I thought it was it was
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:20.460]   interesting of them to say that they were aiming these specifically at women when they when they
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:25.340]   made the announcement at their at their big press conference there and it is decent looking it's
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:31.580]   very similar looking to that to the galaxy gear s2 that we were talking about just a bit ago
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:39.740]   but but it but it is also I think kudos to both of them for I think some steps forward in style
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:48.060]   for both of those two watches anyway yeah I think that one thing that I noticed at CES was just
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:53.820]   the level of redundancy with a lot of these wearables so I mean if there was a lot of
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:59.340]   excitement surrounding wearables prior to the Apple watch unveiling and I think that has sort of
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:05.820]   calmed down quite a bit in the in the technology community they had a lot of these wearables
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:10.620]   featured in the sands which is sort of this secondary part of the of the entire
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:13.500]   conveyor whoever makes it to the sands it's I mean that's ridiculous
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:19.660]   the sands were huge wearables in 2015 last year when I went so I'm not surprised
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:26.140]   so grateful to you guys for for risking life and limb and you know it's fun you know it's
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:30.780]   exhausting but the one I did kind of miss not going to see this here yeah
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:35.900]   some oh a little foam all going on yeah you know I again like I said before it it's a little bit
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:44.620]   like Disneyland for for new tech but I don't know I I I'm glad that I didn't go but I changed my
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:50.460]   attitude I be honest to you I thought I was just crap and now I by the way Amazon's echo kind of
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:56.060]   sneakily became one of the stories at CES Amazon wasn't there but a number of companies
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:03.420]   announced integration including Ford yes yes yeah I think that echo is is rapidly becoming my
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:10.140]   favorite home tech product so many people say that I'm so everybody I know that has it loves it I
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.140]   don't have one we have one at the office you know obviously that we've tested I wanted to it turns
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.740]   out the voice interface is the best interface and it just needs to talk to all the automation
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.420]   stuff and then then you just tell the house to do what you want it to do and
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:28.140]   yeah the fourth thing was really interesting again it's like data and you know natural language
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.620]   processing which is also in this like deep learning and that kind of thing I saw this in so many
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:39.020]   products everywhere this year and I really I was glad to see it that it's so much about experiences
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:43.900]   and and rather than just sort of raw hardware kind of thing as much as we've been talking about
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:49.820]   the raw hardware and style and all that which is great but design and experiences are what define
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:58.140]   CES as well as every other bit of the technology world now and you know a lot of this is powered by
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:02.860]   other sort of back-end systems and that's why you know I asked this the car makers because I was
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:10.300]   like if that thing if that car is a shell for a lot of cloud and data and services and that then
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:15.580]   you know you guys have some catching up to do that's why Ford and not Ford um Google and Tesla you
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:20.460]   know that's part of their DNA already and and you guys don't have that as part of your DNA and so
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:25.740]   you have some work to do and several of them kind of acknowledged that and and clearly with all the
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:29.340]   stuff they were doing with autonomous they were trying to show that they can you know that they
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:35.020]   have the chops uh to do it let's take a break more to come with our panel Jason Heiner from Tech
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:39.820]   Republic is here so we're going to call over imore.com Michael Nunez from Popular Science
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:45.980]   and uh I think we've done CES we'll move on to uh other topics including Peach
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:53.500]   because that's all I did this weekend but first a word about shaving I did shave of course because
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:07:00.940]   I have a nice Harry's razor with that great Harry Shave cream I feel pretty darn spiffy
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:09.020]   guys 2016 is here it's a new year it's a fresh start maybe time to stop overpaying for a great
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:14.700]   shave Harry's was started by two guys passionate about creating a better shaving experience by
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:22.620]   delivering great blades and shaving cream directly to your door they also are nice guys they give
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.380]   one percent of their sales and one percent of their time back to the communities that they serve
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:31.420]   so the way Harry's decided to do this is classic startup they said they didn't they investigated
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:38.060]   how do we make better blades how do we make it uh lower cost we'll buy the factory in Germany
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:44.300]   this is a factory that's been creating the best shaving blades in the world for more than 100
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:51.020]   years Harry's owns it and so they're selling direct to you from the factory they design these
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:59.580]   blades for performance for for for beautiful design and engineering and and sharpness over a
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:04.460]   million guys now made the switch to Harry's and it's easy you go to the website it'll take you
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:08.220]   less than 30 seconds to place in order you have a great customer service experience
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:14.620]   start with a Harry's kit i use the winston set and i love it uh oh they're still selling the
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:19.180]   winter winston i'm glad that's a beautiful copper handle uh there's also the Truman
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:24.540]   which is less expensive and a great way to start every kit comes with a handle three blades
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:31.500]   the travel cover and of course your choice of Harry's great foaming shave gel or Harry's cream
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.860]   and all of this is going to cost you about half as much as razor as the big brands in the drug
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:42.380]   store we'll look at the Truman set fifteen dollars fifteen dollars and in fact i'll get you five

[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:06.060]   bottle harry's dot com use the africode twit five and save five bucks
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.740]   of your harry's purchase i saw you serenity on peach
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:18.380]   aren't you on peach i am yes i i joined pretty quickly because as i was saying before the show
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:23.820]   i i have username terror i want to make sure that my i don't you know you never know what's
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:27.020]   going to what's going to jump and what's going to not and what's going to not so you just have to
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:32.060]   get your name everywhere right yeah pretty much pretty much so i mean granted not many people but
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:37.580]   the Swedes are signing up with settern but just in just on the off chance oh Jason just joined
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:45.740]   Jason Heiner brand new on the uh i i have not decided whether to friend everybody who asks me
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:52.220]   or not so what is so i'm just gonna say no what is uh i started at first friending everyone and
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:57.180]   then realized pretty quickly you get i mean you have this nice little list right people where you
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:01.180]   have your own thing and then you also have this list of individually you have to tap on people to
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:06.300]   look at there's no timeline on this which is kind of interesting it's just kind of it's kind of
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.460]   people and they're out of order too it's not like the newest thing chronological oh no isn't this
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:15.740]   then once i thought it was chronological but then i've occasionally found people that were like 23
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:20.860]   hours ago so i'm not really entirely sure how it's organized mine is so chronological but who knows
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:26.140]   you're right yeah there there's so many see those like two days now it goes jumps back up to one day
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:34.060]   oh i don't know it's it's it's odd it's it's a fun little distraction i will say that Christina
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:40.780]   Warren bless her soul i told me about it on friday and i'm like okay what is this nonsense
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:48.140]   and it feels a little bit like a twitter tumblr timeline with a little instagram thrown in and yeah
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:54.380]   it's it's fun i i enjoy the fact that you can draw with it and it's yeah it's very cheery um
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:11:01.020]   it's i don't know if i like not being able to talk directly to someone other than through
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:09.100]   facebook like pokes that's a little strange um but i do i do really like i love drawing with it i
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:16.060]   love sending like ridiculous uh ridiculous photos and gifts it's it's good so what's really
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:20.540]   interesting about this it was created by Dom Hoffman who was the vine guy right he so
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:27.340]   fine twitter co-founder of vine what's interesting i mean first of all uh there's a million messaging
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:32.860]   platforms but this isn't exactly messaging there it's not quite it's not exactly twitter it's not
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:37.980]   it's kind of its own thing and i think it bucks the trend in the sense that it came first of all
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:45.180]   came for the friday at the end of ces so that's perfect timing for the tech elite to try it and
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:50.140]   get involved in it and then i thought really interestingly has a lot of hidden nooks and crannies
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:55.420]   like it's got unusual features that you don't immediately find for instance you can uh if you're
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:01.100]   if you're in the message section you could type certain keywords i'll type g i f and then you can
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:07.900]   search for uh animated gif and i'll say um i don't know what should i say cakes i don't know i don't
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:12.140]   know what i'm gonna get and it'll search a lot of messaging platforms including facebook's messenger
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:17.420]   will do this kind of thing where you can and i'm just gonna put that in my timeline because wow that's
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:23.500]   awesome and uh and and so there's it's full of stuff like that but you know it's also people
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:30.140]   can cut you can write stuff and people can comment on it and so there's threaded commenting as well
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:37.340]   it's got you could post your battery life your ratings the date the time it's got a very interesting
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:45.100]   and kind of almost eclectic set of features maybe it's just a flash in the pan but on the other hand
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:50.940]   what it really reminded me of is how anxious i am and i think i'm not alone to get rid of twitter
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:58.220]   find something better than twitter i don't want to get rid of twitter i love twitter uh really
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:06.060]   but i am i yeah i mean i've been using twitter since 2007 yeah me too but um i i don't know i i
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:13.500]   enjoy short form messaging i think there's something really really uh unique about it in the context of
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:20.140]   all of our other very multimedia heavy uh social networks but there's the question of what does
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:26.940]   twitter want to be and i yeah if twitter goes anti-coronological 10 000 characters they want to do
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:32.460]   right that's my next thing i want somebody to buy twitter and give it back to the community like
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:36.540]   give it like it doesn't not gonna happen obviously but you know like give the api back to the
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:40.780]   developers would that be nice that would be amazing like if somebody wants to put you know
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:45.100]   there whatever 20 billion dollars i can't remember how much it would take um but i have actually
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:50.940]   thought about this uh like you know like that that like maybe bill gates right uh no he has more
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:56.700]   importance than if he's working on somebody um somebody um somebody buy it exactly curing malaria
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:03.020]   and fixing schools so somebody buy it and there's all kinds of billionaires that waste their money
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:08.060]   and all kinds of really dumb um irrelevant things buy twitter and give it back to the community
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:15.740]   its market cap is 13.84 billion yeah it's expensive it's like 13 powerballs something like that it's
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:22.060]   less than what's that what's happened what ended up being what's happened up being 22 billion yeah
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:28.140]   yeah it's still growing crazy i mean they're growing years just one thing that um over
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:34.620]   twitter i think yeah i sort of have a low hate relationship with it it's obviously everybody
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:39.660]   does you know you don't have to choose yeah and there are um you know there are definitely
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.140]   important things that it provides certainly anonymity being um one of those things i think
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:47.740]   you don't have to be a verified user whereas i think facebook will move more and more in the
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:54.300]   direction of um making everyone verified um and so i think there's like this there's a part of me
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:15:01.020]   that likes the hacking aspect and sort of the um the shady aspects of twitter i guess but i just
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:04.780]   don't think that they're commercially viable those aren't the types of things that make you a lot of
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:10.700]   money and um i think that twitter as a company will see that in the long run you know people i mean
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.380]   there are there are other use cases that are important to you know shared screen
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:19.180]   in experiences or dual screen experiences watching live tv i'm sure the golden globes right now are
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:23.820]   trending oh yeah oh yeah i'll be watching the golden globes on twitter absolutely yeah yeah
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:29.820]   yeah and and those things are both live snarking yeah live snarking yeah live snarking yeah but
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:34.700]   what's preventing facebook from from doing something like that i mean in in reality facebook can update
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:39.260]   in real time you can actually share more meaningful information because there's no character limit
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:44.460]   and um and so i just don't think that that you know twitter reminds me of a group on in a lot of
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:51.340]   ways it's like it was unique at the time but now a lot of people are doing what that company is
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:58.860]   doing it's it's just not um it doesn't have any unique proprietary um software or or coding behind
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:04.300]   it i think it it's just sort of it feels redundant to me it feels like it's the live internet though
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:08.780]   i mean the great thing about twitter is it's yeah live internet it is live and you and you feel it
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:13.820]   and what i really love about twitter and what i've loved since pretty much day one i was reflecting
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:18.940]   on this the other day where uh when i'm not doing tech related stuff i do a geeky podcast with
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:23.660]   jason snell of six colors and we do a podcast called the incomparable and we did one on on star wars
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:30.540]   the force awakens uh which you know that's just a recurring thing uh but a couple hours after we
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:35.900]   posted it we ended up being able to interact with people from lucasfilm who are like oh yeah we we
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:41.180]   saw your we listen to your podcast we really like it we wanted to compliment you on this and like
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:45.420]   that's the that's the kind of experience that you're not going to get on facebook because of the
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:50.540]   because of the way that the friending works you might get like a comment or a thumbs up like from a
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:54.620]   from a page owner but you don't necessarily know if that page owner is actually that person
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:59.980]   it doesn't i don't know i feel like spontaneous conversations is what i what i love about twitter
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:04.940]   that two people who have never met or don't know anything about each other can have a human
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:11.500]   conversation face like virtually face to face um with and of course there are some downsides to
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:16.700]   that there's still a major harassment issue that the twitter has but on the whole it's a it's a
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:22.860]   really great platform for that uh for real time messaging for real time interaction for interacting
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:29.980]   with your with your readers um and for musicians and actors with their fans in a way that's not so
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:37.740]   there's not so much very informal i mean i would say that and and uh and yeah i think you're right
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:42.940]   about sparking up um random conversations but you know outside of the media i think that
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:47.660]   most people aren't looking to have those types of conversations like if you work for a company and
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:53.260]   and you're and this and you're using twitter as part of your um as part of your job whether it's
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:59.500]   as a journalist or as a pr person i think that makes complete sense but um i just don't think
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:05.260]   there's a lot of value in having people tweet at you know their favorite sports athlete or um or
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:11.260]   what you know any any type of celebrity i think that more meaningful interactions will be available
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:15.980]   in the near future we already have periscope we already have um facebook live and i think
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:21.340]   um interactions like that will be more meaningful than like 140 character um
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:26.700]   acknowledgement of someone's fandom or or like you know just tweeting at kobe brian and saying like
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:33.260]   nice slam dunk or something like that i i see i i agree with you on some respects because i i
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:40.220]   think that um most actors and most uh most folks folks uh folks in sports are not necessarily using
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:44.460]   twitter the way that a journalist might use twitter but i've also seen it in two very different
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:48.940]   communities you know before i was in tech i was in the webcomics community and that's a community
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:55.100]   that's that's continued to thrive and and pretty much any internet based uh internet based community
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.820]   loves twitter and thrives on twitter because that's that's one of the most interesting ways that
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:04.540]   you reach your fans and that you interact with your fans so that's a different perspective than i
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:11.180]   have so that's a good thing to know yeah and um actually a great example is um i don't know if you
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:16.460]   guys have heard of the musical hamilton oh yeah oh yeah it's kind of the hottest thing on Broadway
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:23.020]   right now but it's it's maybe ever yeah uh the creator of hamilton lynman well maranda basically
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:28.780]   spends probably a third of his day when he's not working on his future projects or on stage
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:34.860]   interacting with people not just not just like uh thanks for thanks to the show glad you liked it
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.980]   but just sharing interesting behind the scenes tidbits about the show answering questions from
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:46.620]   fans his musical director and arranger uh alix lacmore answers questions from people almost
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:51.660]   constantly and it's a it's a very interesting dialogue like i don't follow many celebrities true
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:55.900]   celebrities on twitter because as you said it's it's a very one-way experience and if you want the
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:00.700]   one-way experience you can go to periscope you can go to facebook uh but then there are people like
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:06.620]   maranda or amanda palmer and you'll game and there's another examples of like people who actually
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:11.820]   take time to interact with people not just uh like glad you liked my book but actually oh i'll
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:17.020]   answer your question or oh you made a funny point i will you know expound upon that meaningful
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:23.420]   conversations not just like you're okay yeah right right my lynman well i'm holding my water
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:30.620]   bellow my uh yeah you go okay so no no no i was tied to you when i was couldn't get to the show but
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:35.340]   he has the water bottle i do i've got the water bottle i stood in line you know they have the
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:41.340]   the lottery i stood in line for the lottery yeah for him yeah so uh it was there were there were
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:48.620]   probably that night 1500 people in line for 21 tickets you know for the lottery and the theater
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:55.180]   itself only seats 1300 you know so there were more people in line for the the ham for ham um those
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:21:00.460]   21 tickets than the could have fit in the whole theater which is that tells you how hot that show
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:07.420]   is and it is also amazing i mean you can listen to the cast album and the music is uh is just phenomenal
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:12.540]   it's really changing um broadway and it's changing i know this is not a broadway show but but it is
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:18.620]   the way that they're using um technology uh has been significant the way that he's in social
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:23.340]   media is particularly i should say um they've tried to make that they actually had a technology
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:29.740]   snafu they tried to make him for ham the the ticket lottery um digital yeah and it crashed
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:35.820]   it failed yeah until they had to go back to man 50 000 people applied for the lottery and this
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:40.300]   is just one day's lottery mind you this is and the only people who can apply are people who live
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:44.300]   basically within city limits who can get to the theater within an hour of the lottery drawn
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:49.820]   50 000 people and it crashed the broadway system because they'd never seen that happen before
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:54.620]   and immediately uh marynda at all are kind of like well so we're gonna go back to the other
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:58.700]   system while we fix this but eventually we'll like to go digital for the winter because it's cold
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:04.940]   outside yeah because they do a little they know that people can't all come to see it so they do a
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:10.460]   a little five minute um performance for you and they they know that most people won't get to see
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:15.180]   the show and so uh they come out and they do a little and then somebody youtubes it every time
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:22.380]   and then marynda marynda um retweets it uh whoever you know a good the best sort of youtube version
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:27.820]   howard sherman works across the street um from the richard rogers comes out of his office building
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:31.580]   and his friends with marynda and he comes down in videotapes at pretty much every night
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:38.060]   i those are crazy and those those originated on social like those wouldn't exist except for the
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:43.740]   fact that marynda tweeted before the very first night of previews hey oh my god there's so many
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.460]   people here we're just gonna do a little like a little thing because hey there are like 300 of
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:54.700]   you here and not all of you are going to be able to to get out to the show they're so cool like it's
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:23:00.780]   such a neat way of incorporating social media into a broadway performance totally and the hamper ham
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.420]   performance reference videos from and and look at where they're posting these things to you
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:10.380]   and instagram yep yeah exactly they're uploading the video onto youtube or instagram and then
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:16.700]   retweeting on twitter so i i just don't think it's like ultimately that great of a broadcast network
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:22.620]   and i think even for things like live tweeting events um there will be better versions available
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:27.180]   in the near future when our tv's get smarter and when our homes are more connected i just i don't see
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:32.860]   i just don't think the user interface is that great and so you know do like informal discussion but i
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:38.380]   guess i don't think that twitter has figured out how to present the most meaningful information
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:42.780]   at the right times and and part of that has to do with their commitment to reverse chronological
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:51.660]   waterfall of information but um but yeah anyways i'm a little bit skeptical about twitter's future i
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:56.380]   just don't think that they're doing enough to to stay relevant and certainly not doing enough to make
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:01.500]   their investors happy and and make money it's so interesting i totally love your idea Jason
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:08.540]   of let's just buy it back and open it up and bring back the api api because that's how twitter got
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:13.420]   there it really and i'm jack dorsey come on that's that's all you have to do and i understand it's
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:19.340]   tough when you're a publicly held company because the shareholders are going to get peeved but yeah
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:25.580]   it does yeah i think that's a that is the only solution that makes any sense is let let its users
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:32.140]   determine its future yeah it's like the dial i love the the metaphor it's like the dial tone of
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:36.860]   the internet right it is the live internet and um it's not that it shouldn't have some product behind
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:41.820]   it but it like if anything was meant to be open sourced it's almost like this thing i think could
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:47.100]   just thrive and and do the kind of things that um uh you know that we're talking about it does need
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:51.820]   to change and it does need to adapt and it does need to get better and and as you know other interfaces
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:58.620]   and mobile and things you know uh become a more uh more part of the user experience that needs
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:03.820]   to be part of it too so i think the community could do it better than one company absolutely
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:09.500]   well there's a funny thing to me always about twitter is i don't understand why they're not doing
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:15.020]   more with their potential analytics in terms of they have access to all of this public information
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:20.220]   you know it's facebook you have privacy settings and you have a vast number of privacy settings
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:25.180]   because you share a lot of information on facebook twitter i think there's a there's a gold mine of
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:31.180]   information on that service that i know that twitter does sell some of their firehose to various
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:35.500]   services but i don't understand why they're they are not the 21st century nelson where they're like
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:43.100]   oh my god yes they have so much data on television on movies on on musicals on shows the fact that
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:47.820]   they haven't figured out they haven't gotten some really really smart numbers people be like
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:53.740]   let's build a program that essentially can sell all of this data this pre essentially previous data
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:59.260]   for to people this is an example of why it privately held or even a publicly held company
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:03.420]   actually especially a publicly held company maybe isn't the best steward for something like this
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:08.780]   this should be a public service because if you had an api and you gave the firehose to anybody
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:14.300]   who wanted it somebody would build that lots of people would probably have lots of people all
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.660]   kinds of different things you know sentiment analysis i mean people are doing some of it now
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:21.020]   but the kind of sentiment analysis let's nationalize twitter
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:26.460]   let's just nationalize take it over there's a title let's not turn it political
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:30.780]   well but uh you know what that's this i think that's the solution you can't
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:35.500]   and i don't see another company buying it as a solution i think it's to be a public i think it's a
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:41.980]   utility it's a public utility it's like the dial tone but it would be what would that's that's such
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:47.980]   an obvious correct thing to do like what would it take what would it take i wouldn't pull out
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:53.580]   jack dorsey opening up the api honestly because there have been talks about it in the last year so
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:27:00.380]   rumors mostly but i wouldn't twitter has taken a very big about face in terms of its root the way
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:05.660]   that it interacts with developers in the last year i'm kind of hoping that that eventually means
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:09.980]   they're gonna have to really step out though because developers have been so burned by it that they've
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:15.580]   really got to convince them that this is a genuine move that would be so gangster if he did that
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.860]   though if he just said you know what we're gonna open this thing up and we're gonna make it we're
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:22.780]   gonna become a platform again and we're gonna build stuff on top of it and we're gonna invite
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:27.180]   everybody else to build stuff to build their own sentiment analysis to build their own um
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:32.780]   applications does that make it more valuable for the shareholders ultimately infinitely more valuable
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:37.820]   infinitely more valuable well you would think so yeah i mean i it's definitely a big assumption to
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:42.940]   say that like it will for sure make the company more money but um but i don't think it's a far
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:47.660]   reach to see it say that jack dorsey would you know potentially open these things up i mean he's
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.940]   been a big advocate for the programmers and developers fast certainly that's where um his
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:57.900]   background is it was dick costalo who shut it down shut down the third parties right and and
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:02.700]   exactly you know getting the founders of that company to even agree on a single idea i think
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:07.820]   has been at least from from my understanding a huge pain over the course of of twitter's lifetime
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:13.660]   and so you know it's no shock to me that twitter's having an identity crisis at this moment in time
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:19.020]   and um i i mean you know jason you've made a great point the more open that twitter has been in the
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:24.700]   past the more successful and at least more um the more that i've been able to get out of it and
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:31.500]   i think that uh that would make it way more attractive to me and i i think to to more people but um but
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:35.260]   yeah you really just never know with these publicly traded companies i mean you know consider my
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.900]   space and and some of the discussions that probably happened around that um after it went public i
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:45.420]   mean that thing tanks pretty fast and and you know i i would say that twitter doesn't seem to be all
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:49.660]   that all that much different it's an interesting politically though it is very interesting because
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:56.780]   increasingly social networks are uh are more than a private company they're really about uh they're
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:04.780]   the social um common ground they're the commons and uh they really should be treated as the commons
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:12.060]   because no one entity one business entity uh should control them remember when you open
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:18.300]   remember when the iranian um when there was those protests in iran and the u.s government went to
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:23.900]   and twitter was about to run a uh some kind of maintenance and yeah right at the same time
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:29.420]   to them several governments went to them it said please do not they're like you know you cannot
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:34.460]   do this this is one of the few ways that people and activists inside have to communicate with the
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:39.740]   outside world because so much of communications being shut down i mean i think that was the moment
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:45.660]   that we all realize this thing is way bigger than what we originally the the kinds of steps Jack is
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:50.220]   taking so far like the ten may be increasing at 10 000 characters that's not what we were looking
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:56.300]   for what you were looking for is a wide open api and a fire hose it's available now i understand
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:30:01.420]   the problem with having the fire hose available that's the full stream is that's expensive uh but
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:07.100]   i'm sure you could get you know support to making that totally available or just charge people for
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:12.220]   access charge them a reasonable fee for access because there's so much value in that yeah charge
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:18.460]   them for the amount of data that they use for something i mean like a utility yeah it's like a
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:23.020]   dumb pipe and that's what the argument that they'll say is that that's a dumb pipe right right there's
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:28.700]   a lot of dumb pipes that make a lot of money dumb pipes good dumb pipe is how is how you get
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:35.500]   innovation because then it's a platform you know open platform on top of it uh what about Facebook
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.900]   let's talk about it you know the all the growth and okay so i'm by the way now deleting peach because
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:44.940]   that's not going to go anywhere but uh but but peaches trying to do is kind of conflate twitter
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:50.700]   and messaging and it's very clear that messaging is a very important platform
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:55.980]   but i feel like Facebook is going to own this there's not much we can do about it at this point
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:31:04.460]   am i wrong man i'd love to see so many of the users you know they're just like kind of well and
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:08.860]   that's critical with messaging right it you don't want to i use this analogy a couple weeks ago you
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:14.140]   don't want to buy a phone that can only call 10 percent of the populace you want the messaging
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:19.180]   platform that speaks to everybody if possible there isn't such a thing yet but Facebook is the
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:25.340]   closest i held out on Facebook messenger for a long time me too people kept messaging me and then
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:32.060]   i kept i was tired of opening up the browser on my phone so finally i was like i get it and i gave
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:36.140]   in i gave in i don't want to give in and facebook like twitter you love to hate so they're one of
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:41.340]   those it's such a pain it's such a pain to have different apps for right don't we want one app
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:47.820]   it is yeah i i facebook in general frustrates me on a number of levels i almost left about
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:54.140]   four years ago and then got sucked back because of roller derby and i'm still kind of it's just
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:32:02.060]   facebook because rollers are i have no yet because roller derby i have no concrete things to say
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:08.460]   except hug because that's how everybody feels that way but because everybody you know including
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:14.460]   your family is there you have to use it it's the aolos 2010 yeah oh it's totally yeah
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:18.780]   yeah and for that reason i would say i don't it doesn't irritate me as much as the normal person
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:24.140]   i actually openly embrace facebook i mean it's not going anywhere anytime soon sure they know a lot
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:28.620]   of information about me but like so does google yeah who cares about that i'm not worried about that
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:35.580]   yeah i mean i feel like facebook provides a greater utility for me then then look any piece of
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:41.180]   software that i that i use on a daily basis i mean facebook and to some extent is more meaningful
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:48.060]   than um than my that my gmail account i i think uh sure i get a lot of work done via email but facebook
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:53.580]   is showing me the perspective of a lot of thousands of people from around the world i've met over the
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:33:00.460]   course of of my lifetime and uh allows me to interact with those people immediately instantaneously
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:06.140]   about any subject and so um yeah i think they're the clear winner in this case and they're still
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:12.780]   growing financially and also um honey on a user uh from a user perspective and the fact that they
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:18.060]   bought what's happened instagram in the past few years and those uh those two services are still
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:24.860]   growing makes it hugely attractive to me and also to further this point i think that uh zuckerberg
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:29.580]   has done a really great job of clearing his name i think for a long time people considered him
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:37.340]   a really awkward nerdy um sort of a an opportunist even to a certain extent or um the social network
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:43.340]   the movie was really at least but um but in the past year maybe year and a half i think zuckerberg
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:49.100]   has done a great job of sharing more of his personal life with people on facebook and introducing
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:55.420]   them to things like the moment he vaccinated his his um daughter over the past week or um is that
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.980]   interesting just taking his fraternity with him.
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:04.220]   Korea is a chance of a 360 degree video i mean he is um one of the smartest people in the world
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:10.300]   at this moment in time he's certainly one of the richest and um i'm excited to see how he matures
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:17.340]   as as an individual i think you know he is the bill gates of our time he is um he has made humanitarian
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:22.620]   issues a really big part of his life and i think he's building a service that people need to use
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:27.580]   and and the people that refuse to use it are ultimately going to find a fall behind i think that
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:33.100]   it's you know it disservice to them and i think it says more about their either self-compensor their
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:40.380]   ability to um to embrace these things more so than it does about you know what he's doing to society
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:44.780]   um you know facebook is connecting more people than ever before and i don't see how that could
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:51.180]   possibly be a bad thing i think um when you talk about sharing ideas quickly and that sort of thing
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:57.100]   yeah sure a lot of that happens on twitter because it's informal and people use anonymous names and
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:02.380]   that thing but i think um slowly we'll all make our way over to facebook it's just it seems really
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:07.020]   obvious to me everything that facebook is doing the that doesn't want to worry you
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:14.140]   no not at all i mean i i think it's it's um you know it's something that they that they
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:18.940]   clared years ago you kind of get rid of email by by having everyone move over to messages and i
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:24.620]   think to a certain extent they're right to to pursue that um i don't see anything wrong with it it's
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:30.460]   just uh it's it's to you know in layman's terms it's sort of like the phone book i guess of of of
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:37.340]   the modern era but um but you know but with more capabilities you can send videos and
[01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:44.060]   gifts and photos and any type of media that you can imagine and um and it's all in one place and
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:49.980]   to me that's hugely important i mean i'm not going there for um for like you know creative
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:57.740]   creative um inspiration necessarily but but i am going there for like meaningful interactions
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:03.020]   with my family and friends from around the world and um i i would personally pay a huge premium for
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:08.940]   that and i think people have shown that they will in the past too and um and so yeah i think
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:12.540]   facebook is uniquely positioned because they're gathering so many so much information about
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:17.500]   different people they've certainly invested in um in a lot of interesting categories over the
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:24.060]   past couple of years and i think they're doing a great job of of making people fear facebook
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:28.620]   less making people fear that there's weird issues and sign up you know they made it more
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:33.740]   mobile i mean and they and even the news feed is better i mean frankly uh whatever the maybe it's
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:40.300]   me using it more whatever but i actually started to like the news feed i don't love facebook i do
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:45.580]   think it's not fair to use especially to try to especially to try to you know their settings
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:50.860]   are just so convoluted oh it's gotten worse yeah i think that's terrible i don't think it's a great
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:56.700]   user experience but i think um i do agree so many people are there that it's it's uh that's the only
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:01.260]   thing it really has um i think that's what it's got going for it the most i do think that they've
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:05.500]   the biggest thing they've done over the last couple years is they went mobile i thought they were dead
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:11.580]   um they were dead if they hadn't gone mobile but they in the most impressive thing they ever did
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:17.100]   two most impressive things they ever did in my mind one was their their shift to mobile um you
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:21.980]   know recently they did it in a very short a period of time to where most people i know now
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:28.220]   use it on mobile um and but the first thing they did and what made facebook facebook is it was
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:33.900]   always up um you know oh social networks in the late two thousands mid mid to late two thousands
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:39.420]   as you guys remember they're just a pain they were slow um you know twitter especially was down all
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:46.380]   the time um it didn't work i think what facebook what made facebook facebook was that um they had
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:51.420]   an amazing engineering culture that created a product that was always up you could always go
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:55.340]   there and you could get your stuff posted you get your photos uploaded because it was primarily a
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:38:02.140]   photo for the longest time it was just a photo sharing and gaming site um and still primarily that's
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:09.260]   what it is um but uh you know that's why facebook i think is what it is and and that does bode well
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:14.700]   for their future and that technologically they also the reason why they're successful now as a
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:19.820]   public company is they understand data much much better than twitter does and they understand how
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:27.100]   to monetize data and um and they are a better platform um they've it's kind of dirty that they've
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:33.820]   made um small businesses and brands um pretty much disappear from the feed unless you pay to uh to
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:37.740]   do it but when you pay it actually works and they show you great analytics on it.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:40.860]   It's me a better experience so i don't want to see all those businesses and brands either
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:46.300]   well that's true i mean i but but at the same time why don't they let you decide that you know
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:50.540]   right yeah i guess what bothers me is that you know i hear about a lot of different people
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:55.180]   championing big data and the importance of artificial intelligence and a number of these things
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:59.500]   and facebook is the company that's doing that at the best it's between facebook oh yeah i'm
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:04.460]   agreeing i'm agreeing google's predictive search is obviously super helpful and a lot of the things
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:09.260]   that they're doing with google.com and bringing that information to you much more quickly but i
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:15.180]   would say close behind is facebook and actually they know quite a bit about um everyone they they
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:20.540]   know more about you and your friends than than probably you do and um and so you know the fact
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:25.100]   that they they killed reverse chronological order and and now the news feed just promotes what they
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:30.940]   think um you would want to see i think that's a huge step toward um toward where we need to be and
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:36.300]   and that actually is advantageous over twitter which is uh frankly hard to sort through.
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:41.020]   I agree that's why they're winning as a public company because they understand the value of that
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:47.660]   data and they're using it um very well and they're making a you know a lot of money because of that
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:51.500]   they're they're printing money they're printing money because of that in the same way that google
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:58.700]   was printing money when it first started um ad sense uh in and and and that's you know why they
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:03.660]   are becoming that's why they are making so much money and and why they are able to buy you know
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:08.940]   all of these companies and so um you know they are they are forced to be reckoned with because of that
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:14.700]   i absolutely agree let's take a break we have more coming up with our great panel and lots more to

[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:15.820]   called I'm more select working title which hopefully allows us um we're going to try and
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:21.260]   build a place where we can present our more long-form feature articles hopefully with fewer or no ads
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:27.740]   which we're pretty excited about. Wow. So um we're we're working on uh the sort of the mechanics
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:31.740]   to get that into place but we're also launching a couple of cool new columns including a help and
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:38.940]   how to column uh for uh for getting some Mac and iOS 101 stuff uh out the door. I love the 101
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:44.220]   stuff and the help stuff you do. I actually read it all the time. Yeah. Yeah I feel like it's really
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:50.540]   important and I've gotten this comment more than a couple of my friends in wildly different areas
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:55.900]   where like you know I googled for this random thing and I ended up finding an article. Yes.
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:49:00.380]   Which is so funny but yeah the um the last thing we're working on and I'm more and we're doing a
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:06.460]   thing called I'm more pop um which is basically Renee's joke is all of the all of the apps that
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:11.260]   serenity and I don't play because we're busy uh we're we're busy you know watching Star Wars for a
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:16.300]   fifth time. Uh so we we're gonna have a couple of contributors come on and write about the the
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:22.060]   komojis and the you know the crossy roads and all of the crazy games and fun and little poppy
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:25.900]   thing snapchat that we just don't have time to do because we're doing all the other stuff. You
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:31.260]   have found a great home. I am so glad after you left Macworld that you went to iMore. Me too. I was
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:35.740]   mad at first because I wanted to steal you but uh I think that this is really the place for you. I
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:38.940]   think you found a great home. I know it would have it would have been hard for me to work for you
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:44.780]   from across the country. Yeah. So no but whereas it's easy with iMore. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:50.220]   And yeah and then I still get to be on Twitch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We we get we get our our uh share
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:55.740]   of serenity. So thank you for being here. Of course. Michael Nunez popular science. We met because
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:59.980]   you wrote a piece uh and interviewed me for it and I said Michael you're great. We ought to get
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:04.860]   you on Twitch sometime. Yeah that's right uh and thanks for doing that by the way. So
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:11.740]   that'll be available to everyone in our march and april issue. It's a double issue and um on the
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:16.620]   cover will be someone that everyone knows. Um he's a great leader. I don't think that I can
[01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:23.980]   mention him by name at this point but we're all very excited about this cover and uh yeah and then
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:28.620]   insurance of just what I'm working on at pop-sigh. Um so we're getting that issue ready. We've just
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:35.580]   come back from CES and um I'll actually be um joining um gizmodo next week. So this is
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:40.620]   breaking news I guess in that sense um but uh I'll be the new technology editor of gizmodo. Oh
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:46.380]   you got a new job. Yeah. Yeah. I did. What the hell? Yeah I haven't really gonna announce that.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:51.500]   Yeah. Congratulations. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah it's cool. It's really exciting. Going to work for
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:58.620]   the AOL. Uh no no not for AOL. No they're gawker. They're gawker. Yeah. Yeah they're their own
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:02.860]   bike gawker. Yeah. That's right. The gadgets. Yeah. That's really cool. Yeah. Yeah. We'll be um we'll be
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:07.820]   uh congratulations. Just doing a lot of new stuff over there and so um you know I still have a lot
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:12.540]   of friends at popular science and I'm still um working on some things over the course of the next
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:19.820]   week but uh but yeah that transition is basically begun and um and uh CES was sort of where some of
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:25.180]   that started. So um yeah all really exciting things. No wonder you like CES went to I went to CES
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:31.020]   and I got a new job. I well yeah I mean some of those arrangements were you know sorted out
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:36.540]   before before the conference but um but yeah it's just been uh it's just been a blast and this time
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:41.100]   of year it's been really really exciting for me. So good. Well and I hear gizmodo gets invited to
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:46.940]   Apple events again so that's good too. Yeah yeah and um and hopefully you know hopefully a lot more
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:52.060]   um people will see just what we're working on on a day to day basis. You know I've been
[01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:57.340]   fortunate enough to to do a lot of TV in the past year and and I think we're hoping to to
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:01.900]   continue a lot of those relationships. Oh good. So uh so I would say that the mission statement's
[01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:05.900]   like pretty closely aligned with popular science. You know we're really excited about the future.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:12.140]   We focus on drones, robots, cars and gadgets and uh and you know I think there's just a healthy
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:16.460]   amount of skepticism at gizmodo and there are a few different types of stories that we can write
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:20.940]   there that I'm just unable to write it popular science. So um so yeah there'll be a little more
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:27.420]   freedom and yeah it'll be cool. I'm excited. Serenity just wrote an interesting article on iMore. Of
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:33.340]   course one of the big stories in in the Apple world is the rumor that is growing stronger and
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:37.420]   stronger that Apple's going to abandon a headphone phone port in the next iPhone.
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:42.140]   They just won't be there. Is that because they want you to use the lightning port or they expect
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:46.140]   all headphones to be wireless going forward? No I think it's a combination of a couple
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:52.540]   different factors. Taking away the headphone jack allows them a little bit more space for battery
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:57.740]   as well as for a slight reshaping of the case. The lightning port you know isn't that much
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:02.220]   big or the headphone jack isn't that much bigger. It's not like it's not just to make it thinner I
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:08.140]   hope. No no but the point is that it goes into the device so it's actually you know of my of my
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:12.860]   6s plus here the headphone jack is taking up probably about that much space. Oh interesting
[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:17.260]   on the interior of it so that's all that's all space especially with drivers that Apple could
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:24.060]   be there's already a petition many many signers saying don't take the headphone jack out a 200
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:30.620]   thousand people. No you know I'm I'm okay with this I'm you know I'm normally anti-port removal for
[01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:37.260]   Apple. The new Mac book is not a computer that I'm going to buy anytime soon. Really? But for the
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:41.660]   6s plus I actually think it makes a lot of sense or the 6s plus for the future generation of
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:46.300]   iPhone it makes a lot of sense. For one thing the lightning you know the lightning connector
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:51.980]   offers a serious amount of power inherent in it and I think that if you want to talk about wired
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:56.620]   headphones there might be a way to make the sound quality better by going via lightning and I know
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:54:02.780]   some analog traditional headphones users will be like that's fine on you Serenity Caldwell that's
[01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:08.300]   horrible. Oh yeah but I have to say you could if by taking the DAC out of the iPhone and having
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:14.380]   an external DAC because the lightning port will give you digital audio you could really improve it
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:18.460]   if you have expensive headphones this is actually a good move for you you're listening to a kind of
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:24.300]   a not so great DAC in the iPhone. Yeah absolutely and there are a lot of things that they can do
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:29.420]   with this you know that it encourages the adoption of wireless headphones which you know what I'm
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:34.220]   wearing wired cheapo wired headphones right now but I actually recently bought my first pair of
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:39.980]   like really good wireless headphones and I'm you know even with Bluetooth not being the best
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:47.340]   connection in the world it's still it's incredible I did not expect to enjoy the wireless headphone
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:52.700]   life as much as I as much as I am and I'm like how did I ever deal with this cord being attached
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:59.260]   to my world I'm jealous I'm jealous yeah I would want to do that too. Do you want anybody going to
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:07.100]   buy these broggy dash in a year Bluetooth tiny little there definitely attractive yeah I mean I
[01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:12.140]   think did you see them at CES I guess they're shipping now yeah they were they were there I didn't
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:17.820]   see them I've seen things like them from other companies that have gone unreleased but I mean
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:22.380]   these wireless earbuds are definitely coming whether they're from Braggie or any other company
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:27.820]   and and I think for anyone that goes to the gym it's like a no brainer I mean you just don't want
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:33.740]   you know there are Bluetooth wireless headsets that require you to wear like a necklace or
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:40.220]   yeah they're wired together in the back but how much battery life can these have there's so
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:45.020]   so these only so these only have five hours and then they come with a little charging case that I
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:49.340]   guess charges them up yeah five five's decent for a work you know it's not like one and a half
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:53.900]   my main thing with the Braggie I think it's a really interesting proof of concept and I love
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:58.140]   that their little their little case is also a charger because that's a way to
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:02.540]   motor rolla did that motor rolla did that with their little earbud their bluetooth earbud and
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:06.860]   that worked very well I've been using that it works well yeah it's interesting but the thing
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:11.660]   about the Braggie that intrigued me and I actually got tipped off to this by a reader on twitter
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:17.100]   so again the idea that it has a it has a built-in music player it doesn't it doesn't need to connect
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:22.220]   to your phone oh has memory yeah it has four gigabytes of memory so you can actually you can
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:28.300]   actually put in your your stuff so I was talking you know completely unrelatedly on the iMore
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:32.620]   show we were talking about the future of the iPod and I was joking you know if they're gonna
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:36.300]   you know I originally last year thought the future of the iPod was the Apple Watch because
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:41.660]   that's you know it's wearables but what better place to wear a wear an iPod than actually in
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:47.180]   your headphones interesting um so I don't know I I wrote this article and I'm like there's some
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:53.740]   pros and some cons to this and battery life Apple owns beat head beats headphone they do they do
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:58.380]   so they're positioned to do something like this exactly he can enjoy my really poorly drawn
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:03.020]   illustration is that me ringing is my phone ringing I thought that was me I was like oh my
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:09.900]   good okay I think somebody else not me there's your there's your problem with the headphone so
[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:15.100]   I think though that's a very interesting idea I mean Apple's not selling many iPods anyway
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:21.980]   everybody's got a smartphone with music on it well exactly so the only really for for the iPod
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:27.180]   to have any kind of future I feel like it has to be wearable in a way because the people who are
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:33.420]   still using iPods for iPods are runners right and people with huge music collections who want to
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:38.540]   want to take their music collection and you know either if you had a wire if you had wire if you
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:43.260]   have an Apple watch and why unwired headphones you can already do the Apple Watch stores you can
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:48.780]   but it's just one playlist it's worth oh so it's it's essentially 24 you know it's well the good
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:53.260]   news is isn't there a new Apple watch coming out in two months they're theoretically yes
[01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:58.860]   we'll see how much more space they can cram into this tiny little thing yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:03.660]   I prefer more battery than more space but we'll see yeah yeah I don't know I don't mind as long as I
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:07.740]   get through the day my Apple Watch gets me through the day very easily yeah doesn't it are you on the
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:18.540]   42 or the 38 oh you have a 38 I have a 42 close yeah the 38 gets me close um if I'm not working out
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:23.900]   heavily I buy big Apple everything I have the 6s plus I have the 42 inch watch because I want
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:30.300]   battery life wow these proggies are 300 dollars what are you using this Apple Watch for I mean I'm
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:37.660]   still you know I've tried just about every smartwatch on the planet and I can't like I wouldn't dare
[01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:42.860]   replace any of the analog mechanical watches that I have I mean they're just like way nicer they look
[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:48.780]   way cooler and I I haven't found either the killer app or the killer feature on any of these watches
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:53.980]   yeah so I'm telling the point I guess is my question is all of you people were thinking people
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:59.180]   were thinking that the Apple Watch was a computer on your wrist when it's actually just a slightly
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:05.340]   smarter fit bit I mean that yeah that's right that's about right yeah no I mean what I what I
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:10.860]   enjoy for one thing I'm not an analog watch wearer and I never I haven't been since I was about 12
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:16.380]   so having the Apple Watch on my wrist actually fulfilled the like oh I have a watch again that's
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:20.860]   nice uh the the big things for me and I'm actually I'm gonna write something on I'm worried about
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:26.380]   this the big things for me almost a year into my Apple Watch ownership is the fitness tracking is
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:33.020]   hugely important there's a app called heart aware on the app on the iPhone now that's I think like
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:37.580]   one or two dollars that that's fascinating it takes all of your Apple Watch data and it's able to show
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:42.700]   you averages and all sorts of things with your heart and if so if you're at all if you're interested
[01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:46.940]   in exercising or if you're or if you're someone who needs to track keep track of their heartbeat
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:51.340]   for medical reasons that's a really good truth and the heart rate sensor in the Apple Watch is
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:57.660]   actually um inaccurate and no I found it to be very accurate it's really I use because I am on a
[01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:02.940]   treadmill and I have uh you know handles that will measure my heart rate which is very accurate and
[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:08.140]   it almost always is exactly the same within a beat or two of my Apple Watch okay so I found to
[02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:13.980]   be very accurate at least for me was that app called serenity or was that app heart aware
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:18.700]   yeah I found out about it from Federico Vitticci over at Mac Stories it's pretty it's pretty neat
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:24.700]   uh but no like the the heartbeat sensor will malfunction for me occasionally um but I would
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:30.300]   I'd say it's accurate probably 90 96 percent of the time which is I'm guessing uh Michael's got
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:36.860]   tattoos all over his wrist no I don't know your boyfriend doesn't doesn't he serenity and yeah my
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:46.380]   my fiance I'm sorry fiance fiance congratulations thank you um yeah it's uh I saw it on Facebook
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:52.460]   that's how I know uh see there Facebook's great you know but aside from the heart rate uh what I've
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:01:01.020]   been really using it for I still use it for notification um deference where when I'm out I just leave
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:05.820]   my phone in the bag and that's really really nice as somebody who gets a lot of emails and a lot of
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:11.020]   texts and a lot of like things that are important for me it's very easy for me to glance down and
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:15.660]   be like message from Renee okay it's about Star Wars it can it can wait until after I'm finished
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:20.220]   eating or something like that it's not the site is burning down we need you right the second uh the
[02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:26.060]   other thing that I really like is with watchOS 2 and complications third party complications have
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:31.900]   basically become my lifeblood there's I don't know if I can really try and show it upside down here
[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:39.500]   um I have uh carrot weather on here yeah as a complication it's not a weather app yeah super
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:47.100]   snarky it's like it's fracking sunny oh go over some sunglasses but I like instant weather glances
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:52.860]   I like the fact there's an app um called just press record that has a complication so essentially
[02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:58.780]   uh this will record voice memo watch at any time after if I have an idea while drawing
[02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:04.300]   or while drawing while driving all I have to do is press the complication and it immediately
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:09.260]   brings up that and starts recording I'm gonna get that sounds good yeah it's that's that's one
[02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:14.860]   of my favorite apple watch apps and it's built for the watch so unlike every other watch app which
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:20.860]   is like loading loading loading it loads instantly oh that's good it loads it's like calling for us
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:26.700]   just press record just press record okay it's great it's one of the few we good for any journalist
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:33.900]   right yeah oh it's it's very elchoppo tell me what's your plans for the future are
[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:41.740]   right see if only uh what's his name is it's john pendant had one of those how about this this
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:46.860]   was at ces the outlet smart sock see i'm waiting i think that the smart watch i'll be much more
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:52.380]   interested we could take my blood sugar my oxygen uh when it can really tell me you know it can
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:57.500]   you know get some good important numbers then it's going to be hugely valuable this is kind of
[02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:05.180]   interesting this is a sock that monitors your baby's heart rate and uh oxygen level and can tell
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:11.900]   you warn you on your smartphone if your baby's in trouble yeah baby tech and senior tech was
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:17.660]   really huge at ces this year you know as a everybody's one or the other at some point maybe both of
[02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:25.100]   you're lucky i will say the worst uh baby tech story that i saw was uh an intra vaginal music
[02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:32.380]   player for the exact same other oh no oh my oh my oh music in the womb oh no no no no no no
[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:38.620]   what just put on the belly like the bacon here it's like put the headphones this is not a
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:45.980]   false needed solving uh honey smart is your maybe some pregnancy test is your thing singing
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:52.620]   to me yeah i need to play some lullabies no um yeah i mean i think that uh i think that you're
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:57.180]   rightly like the health and wellness you know when i found it that's what we need the health and
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:04:04.140]   wellness um category as a whole is is sort of ripe for for for the taking there's a lot there's
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:08.620]   going to be a lot of growth in health and wellness over the course of the next 10 to 20 years i mean
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:13.820]   we just we're going to be absolutely absolutely people want to know more about their health i mean
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:19.420]   i think any well educated person wants to know how healthy they are and and and basically you know
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:24.220]   how their body's holding up over the course of time and and what they can do to to to be better
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:29.420]   about that and um whether it's eating better or exercising smarter and um didn't even write about
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:37.340]   the under armor um what like a smart clothing that they were doing um yeah so i mean you know i've
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:43.420]   written a bit about some of this embedded technology yeah and um project jacar is another one from
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:48.060]   google that's from google and um and and a lot of that stuff is is great but like you said you know
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:54.700]   it's just about who's providing the most helpful information and you know what i found with basically
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:59.020]   a large majority of the wearables market is that there's redundancy across the board so the apple
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:04.140]   watch doesn't seem to be doing anything that um even the fitbit blaze which is a you know a total
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:11.340]   piece of vaporware um which i still can't cancel i yeah sorry yeah i i unfortunately don't run
[02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:16.860]   like yeah i mean it's it's just silly to me to see how much redundancy there is across the board
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:21.420]   and um you know that's the one thing i'll give um under armor with this health box you know they've
[02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:27.020]   at least packaged all this stuff together in in one big box so that you can get it all at once but
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:31.420]   um for the most part they're all doing the same thing they're all using accelerometers to count
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:37.820]   your steps and pull socks on and get the market it's a nascent market which at some point will
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:43.100]   really become important but at this point it's not well yeah i mean it will be the data right
[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:47.420]   the data is gonna be you know under armor is going to be really interesting because they have this
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:53.980]   data processing monster on the back end right and data is going to change health and medicine um
[02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:59.180]   immensely over the next couple decades we're gonna look back in 30 years from now and think like
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:04.700]   oh my god like we barely knew anything we were you know treating all these things um we were
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:10.940]   just throwing crap at the wall to see what's taken yeah yeah in the ways and and because this is
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:16.300]   gonna lead to the air of personalized medicine right we're seeing that already the data um is going
[02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:24.140]   to enable medicines to be able to uh be customized for you and treatments can be customized for you
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:31.260]   based on how your body reacts to um you know to two medicines and two exercise and two food
[02:06:31.260 --> 02:06:36.780]   forget smart cars let's get that going would you please yes yes i totally agree i mean right now
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:41.580]   you know these gadgets can tell you like how many steps you've taken and they're fancy pedometers
[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:46.060]   yeah yeah and and those two things are are helpful certainly you know it's better to know those things
[02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:51.900]   than to not know them but um but like you said there's so many other um just there's so many other
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:56.620]   pieces of biometric information that they can be feeding you and and right now they can't and
[02:06:56.620 --> 02:07:00.540]   and a lot of the technology is available in in hospitals and so there's going to be this
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:04.460]   weird trickle-down effect where um the things that are available in hospitals will slowly reach
[02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:11.340]   consumers and as they do will live healthier and longer lives and um you know i just don't think that
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:16.620]   the apple watch is going to present that either in its first iteration or next year or in 2016's
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:21.980]   iteration i don't think that um i've seen really any consumer electronics that can that can really
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:27.100]   provide that level of detail you know there's a lot of reasons including FDA approval
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:32.940]   and uh just the lack of capability and well hey we got to take a break we want to wrap this up but
[02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:40.380]   i have one more bit i want to yell at john ledger uh but uh first a word from audible.com then i
[02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:46.860]   shall rant uh our show brought to you by the company of all the advertisers we have i've been
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:52.700]   using the longest since 2000 i am an audible lover i have been since i had a long commute and i
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:57.820]   discovered audiobooks and i was buying renting boxes of cassettes and then i then along comes
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:06.060]   audible my life changed for the better now today 180 000 titles rich books but also performances
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:11.020]   and lectures and by the way the great courses are unaudible now you can listen to the best
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:17.980]   college lecturers on every subject i am a huge fan we're going to get you two books for free
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:22.860]   i'm almost almost embarrassed to admit that one of the books i'm reading right now
[02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:32.380]   is that book by marie condo on tidying up the life-changing magic of tidying up the japanese
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:40.460]   art of decluttering and organizing i'm the no snickers from the uh pina caloria okay well no i think i've
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:46.940]   heard of this book yeah it's huge you ask yourself whether each object in your home brings you happiness
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:54.060]   and spark joy and uh and i plan to get rid of everything that doesn't spark joy
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:09:01.100]   so we're gonna be having a massive garage sale very soon uh but i also listen to a lot of science
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:05.740]   fiction i'm now listening to anil stevenson's latest seven eaves and loving it it's hard science
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:09.580]   fiction by this in a sense of you know great science they've gone back and recorded some of the
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:14.860]   classic science fiction books of all time oh here's one of my favorite audio books of all time angelis
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:21.420]   ashes by frank macort one of the classics and frank macort reads it in his beautiful iris accent
[02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:26.940]   it's a tragic state tale but it's his life and it comes to life in his narration that's one of the
[02:09:26.940 --> 02:09:32.860]   things i love about audible books the readers make this up it's not it's not somebody reading a
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:38.460]   boring but it is a performance and if you haven't you may have seen the martian in the theaters if
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:45.020]   you haven't listened to rc bray bring the martian to life and mark wattney's incredible story
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:50.140]   you'll love this too i just there's so many great books here's the deal you're going to get two
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:58.860]   two books for free you'll be going to audible.com/twit2 audible.com/twitin the number two
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:06.140]   uh you're going to choose two books basically you're signing up for the uh platinum account
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:09.980]   that's two books a month account it also includes the daily digest of the new york times of the wall
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:14.380]   street journal i hear this would be a good one too the star wars a novelization of the force
[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:19.980]   awakens i'm told is excellent really well done and this is kind of a dramatization i think it comes
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:25.820]   to life as you're listening i'll play a little bit of this audible.com/twit in the number two
[02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:36.540]   and in response the figure of kylo ren turned and looked sideways directly at the soldier
[02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:45.660]   okay enough enough enough no spoilers a music music it's building i love this audible.com/twit2
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:51.180]   i'll tell you what whether it's a commute a boring hour on a treadmill walk in the dog doing the dishes
[02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:55.580]   or tidying up your home there's nothing like having an audio book and by the way if you have an
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:11:00.860]   amazon echo you can have it read to you and i do that all the time too audible.com/twit2
[02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:10.300]   you will love it all right so a little uh little little john ledger action i think john ledger
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:15.500]   the ceo of uh team mobile has taken a page from the book of donald trump he's realized if you're going
[02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:23.020]   to make something up say it loud yell a little profanity wouldn't hurt the electronic frontier
[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:28.460]   foundation uh starts this story by talking about team mobile's new binge on service saying hey guess
[02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:36.780]   what binge on doesn't optimize the video feeds of its binge on providers binge on the idea is you
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:43.500]   get free uh you know no no uh no bandwidth use viewing of netflix and other stuff not youtube
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:47.980]   uh turns out what binge on does it just takes any video stream if you got to turn it on as a
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:51.820]   team old customer takes any video stream and just down downgrades it to one and a half megabits
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:56.780]   doesn't optimize it if you're watching twit and the the server you're on isn't noticed that you're
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:03.260]   at a slower bandwidth it'll pause it'll hiccup it'll freeze um it is it is throttling pure and
[02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:07.740]   simple now you can turn it off by turning it off that's why john ledger says it's not throttling
[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:14.380]   you could turn it off he said it's bs to complain about it and he said who is this eff anyway
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:24.700]   wow uh wow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh my my you know i'm a team mobile customer i love team
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:30.140]   mobile i don't like zero rating that's this thing that some of these companies do where they don't
[02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:36.700]   it doesn't count against your bandwidth to uh watch netflix or to listen to google music or
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:41.580]   spotify i don't like that it's really anti net neutrality customers love it though right what's
[02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:47.740]   wrong with that uh but it makes team mobile kind of the the arbiter of what's successful and what's
[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:54.700]   not he says why anybody can join bingian it's not about that it's team mobile slowing down all video
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:13:02.300]   to one and a half megabits and team mobile has confirmed that even if john led just this bs
[02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:09.980]   this is their free thing right yeah the idea is uh if you are a team mobile customer and you and by
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:16.940]   default bingian has turned on you won't have to pay for bandwidth for netflix uh i can't really
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:20.620]   i can't really play this because he's very angry and he swears a lot
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:26.940]   it includes a proprietary technology and what the technology does is not only detect the video stream
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:32.540]   but select the appropriate bit rate to not so not so it turns all videos down to one and a half
[02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:41.100]   megabits the eff was able to demonstrate that it does no optimization uh and i can't play part b
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:47.660]   of his answer which is profane who are you eff why are you stirring out so much trouble who pays you
[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:53.420]   i pay them because i'm a donor and a lot of other people pay the electronic frontier foundation to
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:59.820]   to call bs when they see bs shame on you t-mobile shame on you john ledger we know what you're up to
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:07.900]   the big lie does not work all right i think we're done i gotta go we gotta go watch the uh
