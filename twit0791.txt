[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.080]   We've got Ian Thompson from the Register.

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.640]   And there isn't a topic we didn't talk about.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.240]   Starting off with why movie theaters are going out of business.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.960]   Why Prime Day is not such a great deal.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.280]   How Mixer screwed Ninja over.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.600]   But Ninja had a pretty good payday.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.800]   And why Subway sandwiches are not considered bread in Ireland.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.560]   It's all coming up next.

[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.800]   This week in Tech Eye we've got a panel that is on fire.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.160]   Ladies and gentlemen welcome.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.000]   This is the show we talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.960]   And it's except for Ian Thompson.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.240]   It's all her replacement team.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.080]   We were hoping to have Christine Warren here but she's not feeling well.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.960]   But that's okay because of the fires of smoke.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.200]   We're all kind of not feeling well these days.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.120]   But it took two to replace her.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.200]   Simone de Roche for is here.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.560]   Her cohort on the rocket podcast is so good to see you Simone.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.000]   We miss you.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.960]   Thank you for having me back on.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.560]   Thank you for coming on.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.160]   And you said I want I won't be on the show unless I have backup in the form of Alex Wilhelm
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.120]   from Tech Crunch.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.480]   Hello Alex it's great to see you Alex is still living in my house.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.760]   The haunting the haunting has stopped I hope.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.360]   The haunting has stopped but on the air quality fronts
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.720]   Mona and I being East Coasters have have been sitting relatively pretty.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.320]   But I have to say it may be miss the Bay Area more than I think it should.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.000]   When everyone was suffering a lot I wish I'd been there to suffer with us.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.720]   I just felt like I missed it.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.040]   Really?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.240]   No.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.600]   When it's those I'm not going to feel like I miss it at all.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.160]   Oh come on I really miss snow.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.720]   This is one of the worst things about living in the Bay Area.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   Yes snow is three hours drive away but just waking up in the morning
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.160]   and the lawns covered with this virgin thing of snow and you go out and make little angels in it.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.280]   I miss that a lot.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.480]   That's a terrible idea.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.080]   That is Terry Thomas.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.200]   I mean Ian Thompson from the register.com.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.520]   He really looks like Terry Thomas.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.320]   That mustache is definitely has a life of its own now.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.640]   It is going at the end of the month.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.120]   What?
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.160]   What do you care?
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.800]   Why?
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.760]   Why?
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.600]   Are you going to grow it again from November?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.160]   You like cutting it off October 31st to regrow it?
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.520]   Well no I've been keeping it because I was going to do a final week of costumes for the news team.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.200]   And I was going to do that last week but then Monica convinced my wife convinced me to
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.640]   leave it until Halloween week which actually seems more or out.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.760]   But I'm so looking forward to getting rid of this thing because I've never had a mustache
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.680]   before and I will never have one again.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.360]   Is it bothering you?
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.600]   I just have a little centipede on your lip.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.760]   Oh it's just…
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.280]   You know when you wake up in the morning and you've got really bad hair but you know you've
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.400]   had hello over here.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.880]   Now imagine that with on your facial hair.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.680]   If it was like you just gooey horrible prickly mass on your upper lip.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.720]   Oh my gosh.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.960]   It's going. I'm just going to be so happy to be clean-shaving.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.680]   What are you doing with it for Halloween?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.760]   Well I did like a month of…
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.240]   When we started in lockdown I did like a month of dress up for the crew just to sort of keep morale
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.560]   going.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.440]   And so I've got the…
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.600]   I've been growing this and the hair has been uncut for six months so I can do a really good
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.080]   boar wrap.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.240]   Oh my god.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.160]   Did you know is this your fault that he came back?
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.600]   He's coming back isn't he?
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.840]   I have to say I wasn't that into the original boar wrap film.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.480]   This looks interesting as well but it's kind of a one trick pony in a way.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.800]   Yes.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.080]   On the other hand there were classic moments so you know…
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.840]   Special announcement from Kaka-sak-tan Ministry of Information.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.920]   Boar-at is back.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.480]   Boar-at to the movies.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.560]   You know I really want to say that I am sufficiently mature as do not appreciate
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.120]   humor of this level but at the same time I'm also 12 and so I have a suspicion that I'm going
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.440]   to watch this and not be proud of myself at any moment while going through Boar-at too.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.760]   But I mean just looking at this preview I mean I'm in…
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.560]   It's so silly.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.520]   It's so silly.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.320]   It's so silly.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.440]   When did you watch the end of the trailer it says "Thanks Ian Thompson"
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.800]   for putting that back?
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.040]   He's right now a Boar-at shopping for Halloween costumes so it's…
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.760]   I mean apparently he crashes a white supremacy concert at a Mike Pence press conference.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.000]   That wasn't for Boar-at.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.040]   He's been doing that.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.600]   Oh right.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.720]   No he…
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.800]   This is Sasha Baron Cohen who has a really interesting sense of humor and goes, boldly goes,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.120]   where no liberal has gone before in order to expose the corruption, the venality and just
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:58.240]   the stupidity in some cases of the white supremacist movement and that is something.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.840]   Well if you ever see his allergy stuff…
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.320]   Oh yeah.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.560]   I wasn't a massive fan but the drugs episode where he's with a member of the Metropolitan Police
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.880]   and he goes, "So this is Class A drugs.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.400]   This is the best stuff right?"
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.640]   No, no that's the legal classification.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.920]   Really? The allergy interviews with like the Bishop, they had a Catholic priest on one time
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.480]   and he didn't know what he was getting into and it's just one of the most awkward bits of
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.240]   television I've ever seen but also one of the absolutely funniest things I've ever watched.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.320]   I just… I had like one eye closed while I was watching it like trying to just see a little bit
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.200]   brutal but such a good ability to stay in character and really bring out a moment in
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   kind of live recording.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.280]   It's not like they get multiple takes with a lot of that stuff.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.280]   Yes that's right.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.640]   You got to get it right the first time.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.000]   Actually that brings us to a story because… and this would have been normally in the bottom
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.480]   of the pile but I actually think it's kind of a big deal.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:08:02.080]   The decision to postpone the James Bond movie until next spring at the earliest means that
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.840]   movie theaters which have just been hanging on hoping they could make a little bit of money with
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:16.960]   James Bond are now thinking it's over. In fact, two of the biggest movie chains in the US and the
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:25.200]   UK are kind of regal and cine world are apparently planning to close all theaters in the US and the
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:33.760]   UK next week and the question is how long can AMC hold out? I wonder if this… I mean…
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.080]   there was initial hope. Remember when Trolls World Tour came out? I don't but I hear that…
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.440]   Yeah kids, you know.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.520]   That's how I mark time actually.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:45.920]   Absolutely.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.200]   …days through Trolls World Tour.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.320]   So that was one of the first movies that came out during Covid, during quarantine and they
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.960]   streamed it and 20 bucks a pop and it did pretty well and I think the Hollywood said oh thank God
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.280]   we can charge 20 bucks, kind of make some of our money back through streaming and then that was it.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.280]   It was completely flat lined and notice you don't see those $20 rentals very often anymore.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.680]   There are very few first run movies available to stream. It's terrible.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:25.440]   But the movie companies have been doing this for a while, surely there was a thing a couple of
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.320]   years ago where you could pay an exorbitant amount of money and provided you had the right kit.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.480]   Oh man, a handful of people would do that.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.560]   Yeah but I mean this seems… cinemas are currently… I mean I hate it because our local
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.240]   cinema is really good and it's struggling but you know cinemas are dead basically. You can't
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.240]   socially distance in a cinema and expect that to be in an economical business so
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.680]   surely it's in Hollywood's interest to set up some kind of system where you can do these sort of
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.000]   things. I think they're just so worried about IP protection that they're going to let the
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.800]   whole thing burn rather than actually go for a simple relationship. I think that'd be it.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:07.840]   Disney's charging $30 to watch Moonland on Disney Plus. I can't imagine anybody paying that.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:14.400]   Okay so Leo, I said that on Twitter and I was absolutely destroyed by parents of young kids who
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.000]   said look we were going to go see it in the theaters anyways. It was going to be a $100
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.680]   plus a babysitter. That's true. That's $30 and I was like all right parents, all right they're
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.000]   throwing tomatoes at me. It was brutal. They're saying that but it has not propped up the movie
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.360]   industry. Now remember Tenet which was a very hotly anticipated film. I couldn't wait to see
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:40.960]   Christopher Nolan's newest. It was an iMacs movie. It did all right grow globally. $300 million
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:48.480]   worldwide did terribly in the US and in fact in this past week it was beaten by the re-release of
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.040]   Hocus Pocus.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:00.640]   That rocks. I think all the movies that we're talking about here like Mulan and Tenet. These
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.800]   are like hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollar movies. I feel like those are the ones
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.760]   that could draw in the most eyes on streaming but also are the ones that are going to struggle
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.680]   the most to make back their money because they were so freaking expensive to make. Rightfully so
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.360]   because people need to get paid but it's just it's such a tricky situation. They really didn't want
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.560]   to release Tenet on streaming because it was shot for iMacs. They really thought maybe the time has
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:33.040]   come to release a movie in the theaters. People will go back to the theaters and they were I guess
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.480]   they were wrong. It was the guinea pig. It was the guinea pig. It was the one that was out there.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.240]   Like let's try it. See how it works and it did not work and in the US I don't know. I don't know
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:48.400]   when I could imagine going back to a theater myself. No I don't care how good a movie is. I'm not going
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   to risk my life to see it. No film is worth that. But here's my hope. I really hope this brings back
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.960]   more like 75 million dollar movies that might work in streaming. I feel like we had this like
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.280]   everything had to be an enormous blockbuster. All film budgets were like $200 million. Everything
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.000]   had to have this enormous marketing campaign television ads Chevy tie-ins terrible music and
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.600]   it became this enormous production because everyone's betting on these kind of Avengers style hits or
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.800]   Avengers scale hits. Bring back smaller movies. No well that's kind of what Disney did. They had
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:25.280]   this movie. It only cost 25 million to make in 27 years ago. Start Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:33.520]   and Kathy Najimi is witches. They said well let's re-release this poorly reviewed 27 year old horror
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:46.320]   movie and it's a classic. It was in 2,570 theaters. It earned $1.9 million. Oh man.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   But you see there's a school of thought. Yeah. There is a school of thought that could lead to a
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.480]   real resurgence in the British film industry because we've always kind of focused on making
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:06.080]   cheap graphic movies. Yeah. I was about to say economic prestige movies with lots of backgrounds
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.440]   and soft cushions and some nice English accents and the rest of it. But you know why spend $100
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:17.200]   million on a movie when you can do a pretty good movie for three to five mil and you know make
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.600]   your money back on the streaming side of it. I'd love these smaller things. I think the thing
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:30.800]   is streaming services like Netflix are doing that. I think the bigger studios might have the problem
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.600]   unless they're like a Disney who has their own streaming platform because that's where the audiences
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.800]   are. So Netflix can release like a thousand cheap movies and people will watch them because they
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.600]   already have Netflix. But unless you have a deal with a streamer and you don't have a way to distribute
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   that movie except to do the $30 rental and that kind of thing. Yeah. I mean I'm kind of tone Apple TV
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.840]   for example seems to be throwing an awful lot of money at doing these trying to become the next
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.000]   Netflix and then throwing all these shows. I got to say the space one looks quite interesting.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.360]   But you know an awful lot of this stuff just looks like okay what were the B scripts that we
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:11.920]   couldn't quite sell to anyone else. Right. Get that out there. Did you watch being a British fellow
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:20.720]   and a fan of presume of the beautiful game? Have you watched Ted Lasso? I haven't. No. The premise
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.960]   is it's an American American football coach college football coach who is very successful
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:33.520]   comes to England to manage a Premier League football club and hilarity ensues.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:41.120]   Yeah. I mean I love Jason as an actor but you know it just two very different games. I mean it's
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.560]   you've got the American side which is basically runny kicky throwy throwy ball jokey and of course
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:55.920]   it's a completely different mindset. There's funny moments where he says okay so they're going out
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.960]   in the field. It's a pitch. You called a field a pitch? Yeah it's called a pitch. Okay. There's
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   all these cultural moments which actually aren't that funny but there's a lot of it's
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:11.040]   believe it or not a fairly sweet movie but Apple has a problem because almost everybody
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   who's watching Apple TV plus at this point got it for free when they got an iPhone a year ago.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.920]   You don't renew that by the way. I bought an Apple TV a few months ago. You don't get another
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.400]   year. That year is going to run out for most of us November 1st. At which point Apple's going to
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:34.240]   be faced with a PR problem because I have to think most of the people who got that free year and
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.040]   I'm including myself are not going to renew. It's just you've seen it all. There's nothing new on
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.960]   there. That's a problem. I didn't even have a lot of time. I was really bad timing for them because
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.760]   they had their show. They didn't know about COVID a year ago. Not very many shows and then
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.640]   the pandemic and now no one can shoot shows. They can't produce. Hopefully they're saying that
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.000]   succession might start shooting again in New York this fall and I will physically stand on every
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   bridge at once and keep people out of the city if it means that I can have more succession.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:09.040]   I'm with you, Simone. Let's lock off New York City just to get Brian Cox and company.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   I got to know what's going to happen. I watched one episode of succession and gave up on it.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.200]   No, you can't just. I don't know what's going to happen. Slappin. What are you slappin?
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:25.520]   I'm on my way to Rhode Island right now. I'm sorry. It's like the wire. Everyone,
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.600]   my wife in particular is just like, you've got to watch the wire. You've got to watch the wire.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.560]   I watched a couple of episodes. It's like, it's okay, but I'm not about to spend the next 60 hours
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.080]   of my TV watching time covering the entire, you know, it's seven six or seven series or whatever.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.440]   No, no, no, Simone and I are right. Succession is actually one of the best TV shows ever done,
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:52.080]   as was the wire. But you do have to watch the first several episodes of succession before you
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.560]   really understand how horrible this family is. And a lot of the pleasure of watching succession
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.480]   is going, Oh my God, they're so horrible. Right, Simone?
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:09.680]   It's like they were family dynamics that are fascinating. Yes. Okay. Or you could watch
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.960]   still game at seasons one through nine again and enjoy Scottish humor and laugh and enjoy
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.760]   yourself in popcorn. You don't have to watch people be terrible. I live in America in 2020.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.320]   I opened the door and the crap turned those spins into the house. The last thing I want to do is
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.400]   stick my head into another bucket of fake. Nothing bad ever happened in Scotland, right?
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.360]   Exactly. I'll talk about the weather and each other. It's lovely. He is actually a Scottish.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.320]   I'll let him defend him's land. Are you kidding Scotland is it's grim? It's grim. It's not.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.560]   It's not. Didn't you see? Transpot and lad. It's a grim. Come on. It's a grim is country in the world.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.160]   I did. I did love it when transporting and T and transporting to was shown over here.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:58.320]   They had to have subtitles in because it added an extra feature because the subtitles took
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:06.640]   out the swear words. So you know the right the phrase rad C word got turned into terrible personal.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:14.640]   No. No. Are we doing this entire bit because none of us watch the Minecraft stream. Yes. Exactly.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.920]   You know congratulations. You win the prize. We will talk about it. I'm gonna save it for later.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.000]   We'll talk about it because there were other things that happened. Google maybe you didn't
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.440]   notice. I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't. It was a very relaxing event had a night in on
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.960]   Wednesday. We could talk about that as well. There's some news. There's some news. I just you
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.080]   know what? I thought we'd start with something fun and light because honestly what else we got
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.640]   but TV to watch. I'm so true. There's some good stuff. I don't know how I guess they produced
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.400]   stuff at last year that just never got released. But there's there's new stuff coming out. That's
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.880]   quite good all the time. I mean the big problem is in the UK is soap operas because you know they're
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.440]   having soap operas having to deal with COVID. Britain's longest running soap opera is a radio
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:10.000]   show on Radio 4 called The Archers which has been going since I think. You can do. 1947. But
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.320]   they didn't even you know they didn't cover COVID for like the first three months have locked out
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.840]   and then they had to go on pause. And when the archers goes on pause Britain loses its mind.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:29.760]   You know because it's a radio only. Yeah. That would be easy to produce safely.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:36.320]   Well you'd think but everyone had to get organized but also they had to build COVID into the storyline
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:42.480]   without panicking people. And the archers is it's the nearest you're going to get to a cult in the UK.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:48.320]   You know if you go into the archers addicts forums on Facebook my goodness it's just
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.920]   right down the rabbit hole. There are people here who've been listening since birth and they will
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.440]   any inconsistency that will fall. It's very sad but we've killed all of our
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:05.040]   old really like days of our lives and the classics. But I am very happy to say soap operas are
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.080]   taping again in New York City Simone you can run over and you'll be very interested in how
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.200]   they're doing this. When they have to do a love scene they can do socially distance for most of
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.000]   it. You wear masks till you're on camera. They they separate but there are times and as you know
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.720]   and soap operas when you have to make out with somebody. What you do is they do a quick cut
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:32.320]   and the purse the actors significant other comes in. They make out with that person only showing
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:40.400]   the back of their head or whatever. I am I kid you not this is the article from Fortune has soap
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:48.480]   operas are filming love scenes and it's bizarre. The bold and the bold and the significant others
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.840]   like what what is that job and is it like sag appropriate like do you become a member of the
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.640]   actors skills at that point. I need to know. Well they also will bring in a mannequin.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:08.320]   Oh yeah. There's always been a certain amount of smoke and mirrors in that though. One of my
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:16.640]   favorite stories was from Game of Thrones with who's the tall Hawaiian guy. Jason Moore. Yeah.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.520]   Yeah when he was filming his his scene with Emily Clark which is basically a rape scene because
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.920]   it's Game of Thrones. But in order to diffuse the tension he wore an enormous pink fluffy
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.600]   yeah protector. I read about that. And just to try and raise a smile but the idea of making
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.840]   out with your with your significant other on screen it's a very good point. Do they get
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:45.120]   sag benefits it's just like. Well let's see when Bowdoin's flow Fulton is kidnapped and chained
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:51.280]   to a radiator. It's co-star Darren Brooks is why it's Spencer comes to the rescue. It really called
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:59.200]   for a big embrace and a kiss. So once she was freed we stopped tape. Katrina the actress's
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.680]   husband came in and they finished the scene. We see the back of his head and I think it's very
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:13.600]   convincing. Because soap bottles are known. Oh yeah I think it's convincing. Anyway I don't know how
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.560]   we did we definitely got down a rat hole here. Let me let me take a break. We will talk about
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.440]   Minecraft. We will talk about we're waiting. Apple the other shoe has not dropped. We know
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:34.080]   Apple has an iPhone up its sleeve. But when we could talk about that. Google's announcement.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.960]   Google says it's going to give a billion dollars to the publishers. Talking a little bit about it.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.720]   Oh that's nice of them. And Twitter by the way just a little word of warning you cannot tweet
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.400]   that you hope the president knocks from COVID. Because it turns out who knew this. That all this
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:56.960]   time Twitter has prohibited posts calling for people's harm or death. Which must come as kind
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:04.240]   of shock to your co-host Brianna Wu on rocket. Oh yeah. And to the squad members and a few other
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:10.880]   people. I've even gotten death threats on Twitter. I have no idea that was illegal. So I haven't
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:19.200]   threatened anybody back though. I'm glad to say. We will come back. TikTok also has had a reprieve.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:25.600]   Which is a good thing for Fleetwood Mac. Did you I'll tell you why. Oh the pumpkin. I'll tell you why.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:33.520]   There's a lot more to come. Now Simone you may want to cover your shell like ears for this next
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:44.080]   commercial. Oh as as many of us know. Just look at that mustache. We've been in quarantine for some
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:51.760]   time. Which means we probably haven't been grooming as much as we should. It's time to
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:24:01.440]   manscape. This is. Okay. You can all just go away right now. You can all just go away right now.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:08.880]   No I think manscaping is great. This is the manscaped. I'm holding up for those of you listening.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:17.600]   The manscaped pure performance package. Which is a great subscription package. They have something
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.920]   new though. I'm going to mention the performance package because it comes with the lawnmower 3.0
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:29.280]   trimmer. Which is honest. What are you laughing at. Which is honest. If I've never done these ads
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.800]   for you before Ian. Is this the first time you've heard this. No. Listen. Look we all do manscaping
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.400]   because if you cut the weeds back the tree looks bigger. So no go for it. You took the words.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.520]   Of course Simone. She didn't know. We didn't know. I didn't need to know this about Ian.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.560]   This is. I'm not at all just taking care of this. Yes you want to you know what you I'm sure you
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.960]   feel the same way Simone. You don't want to come out looking like a quarantine. Looking like a
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:04.240]   Sasquatch. One has to take even if you're alone in your quarantine. Have some self respect. You
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.880]   know just so they've just come out with a new thing. Which I'm well let me finish showing you
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:14.400]   this. This is the lawnmower 3.0. Beautiful ceramic blades which means they wear well their extra
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:21.360]   sharp and they vibrate 7000 RPM. Which means you can barely hear it. And the faster it moves the
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.560]   more accurate and the less pulled the less nicking. It's got this great light. So if you're going in
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.520]   to the deep forest you can really see where you're going. I love this. Plus it has a USB
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:38.640]   charger. So it's got a little stand which I have on my sink just at the ready at any time I need it.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:46.880]   I could just whip out the lawnmower 3.0. This is awesome. We don't have it yet so I want to
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:53.360]   talk about something new. But I can't show you you'll have to go to manscaped.com/twit to see it.

[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:39.200]   like this. This works so well. It has a proprietary skin safe technology which helps prevent
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.400]   nicks and snags and tugs. You don't want to stick anything in your nose. It's going to snag or tug.

[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:07.680]   higher aspirations than being married to a cave dweller manscaped.com/twit. I got an email the
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:14.560]   other day and said I don't turn into twit to hear about Leo shaving his nether regions.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:23.200]   Why not? Exactly. It's the thing no one tells you about getting older and it's really irritating.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's just like I've passed my half century last year and they don't tell you that your hair starts
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.560]   growing in and your ear and nose hairs grow out. It's nature's little joke. I've never had
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.840]   ear hair before. What is the evolutionary argument for ear hair? There is none. It sure is not.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.600]   This has been at home with Leo, aren't you?
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.840]   T-M-I.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:57.120]   I mean my wife took a certain amount of flak when we first went up to you because she doesn't
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.440]   shave her armpits or had legs or anything like that. She doesn't expect me to. Why should I expect
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:10.080]   her to? She doesn't shave her legs. She doesn't shave her legs. She doesn't shave her legs.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:22.160]   I grew up in the 60s and the 70s and nobody did. It's just more a's. It's what style and fashion
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.280]   tells you. Also we're seven months into a pandemic now where no one can leave their home.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:35.520]   You know when I did yesterday I felt so bad for my wife. I went out and I bought a foot bath
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:42.000]   with a heater and a massager and I said honey I don't know how to give you a pedicure.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.120]   Please put your feet in here and I gave her a massage and a foot massage.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.680]   She said don't cut my nails. I said you cut them. I'll file them. She didn't want me to paint them
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.080]   but I've offered to. We have to help each other in these difficulties. That's really nice.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:07.360]   It's all heartedly. It's actually was. I highly recommend it. It was it was a fun thing to do.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.960]   We did it. We were outside. It was a nice day for the first time fresh air and in quite a while.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.320]   It was kind of nice. It was very relaxing. I enjoyed it too. And we listened to Michael Cohen's
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:24.240]   book while we did it. Just to set the ambiance right there. Isn't that romantic?
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:33.200]   You absolute Romeo there. I can't do that. We were at the point where he goes
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   and then the FBI without knocking came in my house and took everything. It's really it's like a mob.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.160]   It's like a mob memoir. It's hysterical. Okay, enough.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.400]   Although I have to say I've been waking up every morning for the last couple of days going who's
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:57.760]   got it next? Who's next? Who's next? It's been a scary time in Washington DC. Well, I mean it's
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:04.720]   also I mean we may be coming to this later but I do have to say that everyone's just like oh I hope
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:11.360]   so and so dies. I hope so and so dies. Okay, we'll keep that. Bad juju. Don't say that. That's
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:18.240]   bad mojo. No one should die. Enough died from this. No, I wouldn't wish covid on my worst enemy and
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.280]   Trump isn't even on the top five of that. So, you know, it's like no, I wish him well. I hope he
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:32.640]   recovers. It's it's terrifying and and however you feel about the president, it is very scary when
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:40.160]   you know the first inkling that something was going on, a plane spotter who keeps track of all
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:48.640]   of the air traffic noticed that the 3B Mercury, two of them have lifted off and we're flying over
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:56.160]   Washington DC. These are the command and control planes for a nuclear war that go up. It's called
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:02.640]   Looking Glass that go up in case the strategic air command is destroyed in a preemptive attack.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:10.000]   They have these flying command and control that can launch nuclear weapons from submarines,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.280]   atomic missiles and they went up half an hour before it was learned the president had
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:20.960]   tested positive and there's a good reason for that. It is very destabilizing, very risky
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:26.400]   when the president of the United States is at a commission and it was a very clear message
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.280]   from our armed forces. Do not mess with us right now. They said it was pre-planned.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:38.320]   Yeah, no, of course they said, of course, yeah, I mean, you know, I'm sure they're in the air
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:45.520]   all the time for training exercises and something and so forth. But this was of note and I think
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.160]   not a coincidence it went up 30 minutes before this announcement. Well, I know you love snarky
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   British humor Leo. So the BBC news quiz for this week was recorded on Thursday night and they
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.640]   actually opened the show with this show was recorded before we heard about President Trump's
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.280]   infection. We hope that he recovers fully and that he gets better and as a president.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:15.120]   I'm not going to read the chat room now for like two minutes after that one. I'm going to pass
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:23.520]   on reading chat. There's chat. Oh, man. Yeah, if you go to live or something, there's a chat.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.400]   It's okay. I can't read and talk at the same time. This is only your second time on Twitter.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.920]   I think we generally advise it until your 10th or 11th time you stay away from the chat room.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:41.280]   You have to stay away from the chat room. I find the chat people are 99% of the time.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.240]   I'm not afraid. Oh, I love that. There are a couple of, I'm not going to say the W word because
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.440]   this is a family show. But no, I mean, here goes. But Brian Lueckes and Wankers.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:57.520]   But nice. Listen, we don't have a show title. The whole thing on ball shaving. We can.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:07.200]   The show title is which what is it? Wickeys, Wickeys, witches and wankers.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.600]   Weirdos, Wickeys and Wankers, ladies and gentlemen. I should mention military.com
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.480]   said those looking glass planes were launched. It was coincidental.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:24.560]   They were part of pre-planned missions, purely coincidental.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.480]   Yeah, okay. I believe what you want.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.680]   No, it's interesting. The amount of stuff that gets done on this is actually quite shocking
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.400]   when you look into it. I did a- It's actually fascinating and somewhat reassuring.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:44.480]   Well, I mean, I did a speaking tool with another guy who's been covering this.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.520]   I don't know if you know, there's hundreds of millions of dollars worth of $2 bills
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.600]   in a bunker ready for nuclear war because after nuclear war, money is going to become
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.760]   essentially worthless because there's going to be so much of it lying around. So they shrink
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.440]   wrapped about $500 million in $2 bills and put them in a bunker because nobody uses those.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.520]   And those will become the currency after the apocalypse. They have these planes constantly
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.760]   circling around. What you nut job was ready to go. What nut job wrote a paper that convinced
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:21.200]   the Pentagon to bury $2 bills because those would be the future currency.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.560]   Well, that's because when you said that thought it. Yeah.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:29.440]   I mean, in the 1970s, when they introduced the $2 bill on the understanding that people would
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.960]   want to use it, nobody did. So they had all these $2 bills, which they didn't know what to do with.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.080]   So they shrink wrapped them, stored them in storage. You know who would buy those? Steve Wozniak.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:47.360]   He is. Seriously. He loves. He loves $2 bills. He would buy them. Apparently, I didn't know this.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:53.040]   You can get them from the mint uncut. So he'd buy them in big sheets, like of $102 bills.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   And then he'd cut them up and bind them into a pad, like four bills, like a, like, you know, a
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:08.000]   pad of paper, four bills per sheet. And then he would, and this is very Woz. He would go into stores.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.520]   They'd say, Oh, that'll be $8. And he'd go, okay. And he'd tear off a pad and he'd cut out the $2 bills.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:21.920]   And he'd say, here. And he hoped, he hoped they would freak out and think they were counterfeit.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.200]   Because nobody knows there's even a $2 bill. And the fact that he was cutting the
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.880]   scissors off of a pad, but he kind of implies that maybe this is something he brought at Woolworths.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.160]   He just loved that stuff. That's wise.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.440]   You know who else buried money though? Pablo Escobar. So maybe we shouldn't be imitating that.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.160]   Come on.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:49.840]   I mean, what is the deal? So, okay, the world.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.560]   Yeah, who's going to be left? We have a big nuclear war.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.960]   Currency's no good anymore. And then you what you write it on a plaque somewhere. There's
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.920]   there's a million dollars and $2 and $2 bills buried here. Dig them up and spread them around.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.480]   He's on sign that comes up. It's a very small out 76, honestly.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:11.920]   Spasar. I don't know. All right. Let's talk.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.880]   I plan to be dead. I live in New York City. So I'm not going to make it out.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.240]   That's the best reason to live in New York City. You want to be on ground zero.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.440]   It's a high fast. Yeah. You want to even know.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.240]   Good pizza. You know, it's that good pizza.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.440]   That pizza, yeah. But you don't want to know, right? You don't want to
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:32.960]   slow lingering radiation death for sure. Yes, I do. I want to fight to the medium
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.720]   as less depressed than I used to be, but I want to survive that. I want to be there.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.920]   You know, I don't want to be the first one to be vaporized and turned into carbon dust.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.320]   I want to be the last person with a bone in my hand fighting off the high.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.520]   I can see you as snake pliskin with a with an eye patch.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.880]   I'm getting a bottle of good good scorts going out into the back garden,
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:38:00.240]   getting the ultimate suntan. I'm with Simone. I want to be on ground zero
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:06.560]   and it just it's over and done with and you don't even know it happened because it happened so fast.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:11.360]   It's just you're incinerated. That's the way. And you don't. What you don't want to be
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.320]   is like in a small town like Petaluma, when all the big cities are destroyed.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.960]   And now I got to figure out where the $2 bills are buried.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:26.160]   That's the last thing I want. Well, I would say just for viewers, if you don't want to get
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:31.200]   depressed, don't watch a British documentary called Threads, which was based on actual war
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.800]   plans done in 1984. It's kind of, I think the American version was the day after, but that was
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:43.760]   kind of like a Disney-ified version. Threads was young and I don't maybe this was a morbid streak
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.120]   of mine, but I read all like on the beach, the classic,
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:53.600]   that there in Australia, Neville, yeah, I'm a special member of the Neville shoot fan clubs.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.320]   That was a great novel. So the plot is there in Australia, so the last to go.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.280]   So the civilization is not only been destroyed, but the but the nuclear fallout is basically
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.040]   destroying the earth. Nobody will survive this and they're on Australia. That's my nightmare.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.360]   If you want $2 bills though, here's my hint. Okay. The Washington State Ferry services
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.840]   are the only people I've seen like hand out $2 bills has changed. So if you're looking for those
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.440]   $2 bills, just head up to Washington. Nice. And you get a ferry ride and to boot,
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.120]   but you have to pay in hundreds or something so that you get a lot of change. Oh, yeah.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:39.760]   Prime day, who's excited? No. Sorry. Not a fan of Amazon. It's marketing. It's marketing
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:46.240]   bollocks. I'm sorry. It's just like, here's a thing that we're going to do some. It's kind of like
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.440]   black, you know, the whole sense. Have they got any good deals for Prime Day for the last
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:57.200]   five years? They really aren't good deals. Now, Simone, you said you're not a fan. Do you actually
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:03.840]   not use Amazon? Are you boycotting Amazon? I don't use Amazon. I will say I have had like
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.720]   slips in the last couple of years, but last Christmas I did manage to do an Amazon free Christmas. So
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:14.800]   yeah, I'm not judging about it. People make their own consumer choices, but for me, because I'm from
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:21.600]   Seattle originally or from Washington State, it's kind of like a specific bitter feud that I have
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   with Jeff Bezos. That means I don't buy things at Amazon. Is it hard? Is it difficult? I haven't
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.960]   ever tried this. No, it's not actually. I will say part of the reason I can do this is because I live
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:38.080]   in New York. So for me, it's more of a matter of just like walking out to wherever whatever store
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:43.040]   is closest and I'm in buying something there. And I do that because I would rather buy something
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:48.800]   that's already been shipped to the city than ship something in. But I understand that people
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:54.240]   in smaller towns don't have that option. So that is a waste of resources to ship additional
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:00.480]   thing in even when it's already. But in COVID, you obviously aren't going out to shop. Oh, yeah,
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:05.600]   I am, baby. Really? Okay, I will say I have been doing way, way more online shopping. So you are
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.000]   not wrong. Yeah, but for grocery shopping and everything, I still go to the grocery store.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.480]   Yeah, you kind of have to. Yeah, you kind of have to. Yeah, you've tried all the deliver services.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:21.360]   But they it's it's always hit or miss. And I just you know, I get I get suited up.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:29.200]   I saw this as you walked in. I never been in a men's locker room.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.280]   Me specifically me. No idea. Everyone buy you some money on this.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:45.440]   Two piece of gear people were before they go out and play hockey. But it is a it's actually a
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:52.640]   really this is made in Canada. This is called the O2 mask where I lost the but this is this is like
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:59.200]   N 98. So if I wear this, and then I wear a face shield or I put on my safety glasses
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:06.240]   and wear my mask and then the problem with grocery stores is if they let too many people in, you
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.800]   can't really socially distance. So I'm very careful. I don't go down an aisle until there's
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.600]   someone there and they run down and grab it and come out. I'm paranoid because I'm old and I'm
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.480]   you know, I'm in the high risk groups. Was that mask like helpful for you with the smoke in
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.920]   California? Yes, I just got it. But it absolutely is. And before I've been making my own masks,
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:32.560]   which is really fun. I like to sew. It turns out who knew. I know. And I you know, I make pretty
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:38.320]   masks that are that are probably not very effective, but I wear them. And then then I got a mask
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.760]   fitter, which goes around your face to hold it in. And that works even better. And this is kind of
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:50.080]   the next the next step. But if I'm going to go out to like a store, I want to take every precaution.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.080]   I don't want to. I'm very nervous for sure. Yeah, I want to get this thing.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:00.720]   Well, I'm just going to my new mask in and I've gone full meme. Oh, I love it. He's the it's
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   the real what do they call this the fire dog? You know, the dog who's saying,
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.840]   sitting in this is fine dog. Yeah, I love it. That's a good mess. Gotta be done.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:15.440]   I only like to prime day because I have a beef with it that I want to bring up before I forget
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.080]   about it, which is they call it prime day. And then it's two days. Prime days.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.880]   Well, just like how black Friday is a month now. Sorry, I'm putting up my
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.280]   let me see. Oh, that's cute. Now, is that tensionally mashing your frock?
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:36.000]   No, it is not, but it is my nicest mask. It's really cute. Yeah, you didn't make that though.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.600]   Did you buy it? I bought it on Etsy. Knitted forch arm, I think is the store. Etsy has a lot of
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:47.120]   great masks. Yeah, but I mean, coming back to prime day, I've got my big beef with that. And
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.240]   also black Friday and the rest of it is that tech companies are making downgraded kit to sell
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.920]   on sale just for these days. So prime day, you might be thinking you're buying the full quality
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.800]   version of something. Yeah, you're not changing something easier. Like what? I'm getting something
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   with it. Well, okay, for example, I bought a laptop a couple of years ago on black Friday.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.920]   And then I checked with the spec back from a month ago, they downgraded the spec. They were building
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:24.080]   basically obsolescent parts into a laptop selling it cheap. And this apparently is something which
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:29.840]   is quite common. And I've been trying to do some digging into this, but it seems that an awful
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.400]   of the electronics devices that we're dealing with on these kind of sales days are specifically
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:40.320]   designed for the sales days to keep profit margins up. So it's really going to keep stuff in.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.040]   Then I'm going to be like, you know what? Let's just make less money today. Let's just give
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.160]   everyone a deal. Yeah, just all capsules work. Of course, you're saying you
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:52.000]   it's called the sale last year. It's not the same thing because I don't think they did it like
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.400]   intentionally to be obsolete. But the Nintendo switches that were on sale for Black Friday
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   last year were not the new battery model that had just come out. It was the older model that
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.200]   they were just like, let's get that off the shelf. Let's just get them out of here. So,
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.400]   but it wasn't necessarily totally clear for your average person buying a switch on Black Friday.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:17.440]   So it sounds like Black Friday and Prime Day are the worst times to try to buy stuff instead
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.720]   of the best times. Is that fair? Yes. Oh, yeah. I think so. Wow. All right. I've learned something
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:28.560]   today. And Simone, if you won't buy it Amazon online, would you buy it Walmart?
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:35.520]   Oh, I try not to, but I have I've done that. I've done it. That's part of the problem I have is I
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.040]   can I acknowledge the problem with Amazon, but I don't feel like Walmart's any better.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:48.080]   They're not. I mean, that's the thing is that with ethical consumerism, there's really not a
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.720]   perfect solution. That's an oxymoron. They're compromises. Yeah. It's a good consumer.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:58.480]   Yeah. I think everyone just has to pick their own battles and fight their own battles. And
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.560]   that's at the end of the day, all you can do is like, I'm not going to hurt Amazon.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.120]   They're not like, we got to get Simone on our platform. Oh, it's so frustrating. It's, you know,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:12.720]   it's just a choice. No, I mean, I'm with you. I've I've boy-cotted Amazon for many years because I
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:18.640]   like to buy local buy small and the rest of it. But there are some things I can't get elsewhere,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.520]   you know, try buying Captain Tape anywhere else on the Amazon. You're onto a short or onto a loser.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.880]   We talked last week about sidewalk. We've been talking about it all week. This is the
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.680]   network Amazon announced a while ago, but finally kind of rolled out at their event last week.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:42.000]   This is the mesh network. Amazon wants to create in all it's really a ring product, I guess,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:50.800]   which is also Amazon. The idea is a low band. It's called LoRa network that is can go
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:56.640]   two to five miles with the transmitters, but everybody who has a ring device or an Amazon echo
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:03.120]   can be a hub and continue to spread that out around the neighborhood, ultimately putting a mesh
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.840]   over the entire neighborhood that could be used for geo locating their first product. They
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:13.200]   asked was a mailbox sensor, but they said you'll never lose your dog again because you will know
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:18.240]   exactly where your dog is in the mesh at all times. I imagine Amazon also intends to put this
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.480]   in their delivery trucks. Maybe even it's probably too expensive to put in packages
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.320]   because you need a transmitter, but this could be hugely valuable for Amazon's logistics as well.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:35.040]   If you don't trust Amazon, how do you feel about the idea of an Amazon kind of wiring with,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.880]   you don't have to do anything. It's not it's not up to you wiring your neighborhood.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.800]   Okay. So with my my in-laws, I go around to the rooms and I'm in an unplug all the echoes and
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.920]   dots because I don't trust them and all the Google homes as well because my father
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:54.320]   likes technology. Oh, I don't like to be here. You stuck with me. I support you.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:01.680]   My our 17 year olds will be 18 and two in about a month goes around putting all the Amazon
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:08.080]   devices and the Google devices, the cameras face down. It just goes from the house because he
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.840]   doesn't want to be spied on and he turns off the Nest camera when he goes out on the deck and
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:19.760]   you're welcome. I don't want to. When you're. No, I mean, I think, I mean, I refuse to have any
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.240]   of those devices in the house because I don't see the cost benefits. I just hear with a bunch of
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:31.840]   luddites. I mean, technology podcast. I mean, I'm going to have that we're all together, you know,
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:37.280]   joining hands in our anti Amazon, anti camera observation world here. This is great for me.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.400]   Well, now, I mean, this has been one of the things that working from home has already sort of
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.640]   made things interesting as a couple because Monica has heard me during my working day and has
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.360]   been kind of shocked about the amount of profanicy which goes on in my day to day business.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:49:00.240]   He works for the register. Of course, it's what I mean. I don't want Amazon or Google.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:05.040]   Anyone else listening in to me shouting and screaming at people. Okay. So let me ask you.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:10.880]   What do you guys do about this, your cell phone? It's got a microphone, two or three cameras.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.320]   It's got GPS and it's always on the internet. What do you do about that? Do you?
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.160]   Well, that's the thing. I've already got a spy in my home. It's my iPhone.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.680]   Yeah, mine is. We'll get everything else.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:27.680]   Not how spline Alex when you turn off your in-laws, all of their devices. Do you also put your phone
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.640]   in a lead-lined box? No, I put myself in a lead line box on the phone on top. So I can still get
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.320]   tweets. That's the correct way. No, I look, Leo, it's like saying, Oh, you've been shot once.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:43.520]   Why don't you get shot a thousand more times? It's the same thing. It's not. I can try to have a more
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.880]   secure, safe, personal, digital environment and not put cameras and microphones all over my house
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.160]   attached to companies with spotty track records about privacy. At least my phone. This is an iPhone
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.360]   11 something. I don't know. Someone can tell me what it is. It's got two cameras, not three.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:01.120]   I don't think it's with bad ones. But like Apple actually has a reasonable history
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.600]   with privacy because they're not an advertising company. Amazon and Google are huge advertising
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:11.280]   companies. I don't trust them. I don't. Yeah. I mean, all it takes is about half an hour of work.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:18.880]   You can lock down. I mean, I'm a pixel user. Next is before that. I'm sold on Android. That's fine.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.200]   But all it takes is half an hour of work. You can lock this stuff down. You can turn off the
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.360]   microphone. You can activate it with a simple button push. But I don't want a phone that's
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:31.840]   listening in on me the whole time. And Google is making it purposely difficult to do that. But
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.720]   that's that business is my business to get in their way. Comparing contrast you three
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:45.120]   with me. I turn on all beacons. Everything. It's all on the networks on everything's on.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:52.960]   Am I like somehow? What's is my life worse because of that? Is anything gone on? I can't. I've
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:59.360]   been doing this my whole life. I sit on camera 20 hours a week. I show my home address. I sure
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:07.040]   your home address. I still slightly mad about that. I'm so sorry. I apologize. I forget sometimes
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:13.360]   that people care. I don't feel like I'm suffering because of that. The police haven't come and
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:19.760]   dragged me off. I'm not. I'm not in Amazon prison. I don't get more ads than you do.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:25.840]   But why give it up for free? You know, it's like this stuff is valuable. If they're willing to pay
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.400]   me for this stuff, fine. But why give it up for free? Why not?
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:36.080]   That's the president Senate. I think it is a slippery slope because I when Apple introduced
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:41.360]   Face ID to the iPhone, I was very against it. I was determined not to get the phone with the
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:46.000]   Face ID. I love Touch ID so much. And then I did get it. And I was like, okay, well, I'll turn it
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.200]   off when I go through airports. I'll be really careful and lo and behold, I don't do that anymore.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:57.120]   I'm very complacent with Face ID. And I think similarly, the more that we allow tech companies
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.840]   to encroach on our privacy, the more we'll just be like, well, nothing bad is happening. Yeah,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.000]   I guess it must be okay. And that's how you get it. What's going to happen?
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.400]   >> Damn right. >> Jeff Bezos going to come to my house and force
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:16.800]   force feed me Amazon products. I mean, we have Amazon selling data to police departments and
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:23.280]   selling Face ID technology to the military. We have a situation that could with bad actors
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.960]   get completely out of control. >> I would submit.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:33.920]   >> If we have a situation like that, we have so much of a bigger problem
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.760]   than just the fact that you've got a lot of data online. If you've got a government that is at
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:46.080]   this point going to start dragging people off, we're in much deeper trouble. And there are much
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:50.400]   more proximate ways they can grab you, including just taking you off the street.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:55.120]   >> I don't think it's that serious. They're not going to be dragging people off the streets.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:59.040]   They're going to be saying, someone will have a quiet word with you and say, look,
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.000]   we just happened to notice that those websites and the rest of that. Maybe you might like to
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.560]   tone down your criticism of certain things. >> When that happens, I will be the first to let you know.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:15.600]   >> Also, one more nuance to this is like, I want to have kids, and I want them to be able to choose
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.640]   for themselves how much of their data is collected. >> It's too late for my children, unfortunately.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:27.920]   That's when I agree with you. 100%. I wish I had shielded my children better.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:33.760]   >> Well, I've got to say, I feel phenomenally lucky to have grown through my teens and
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.720]   twenties in a time when digital photography was not available, because my reputation would be
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.880]   trashed right now. Some of the pictures that could have been taken in those years.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:50.400]   Now, it's all online. Everyone is sticking the stuff online. We're either going to have to come
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:57.840]   to a point where you understand what I hope is that we'll come to a point where people will accept
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.240]   everyone who's imperfect in the rest of it, because there's always evidence online.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.720]   But I fear in the current puritanical streak of things, and it'll be used against people.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:12.640]   >> Yes, absolutely. All the pictures on the giddy of me are from when I weigh 50 pounds more,
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.400]   terrible, and I can't get rid of them. >> I'm stuck with all these bad pictures.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:24.240]   >> Sometimes you're going to say, all the pictures on giddy of a younger me, and then you're going to
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:29.920]   be happy. >> Wait, you're three for the long year, Harry, you'll look back on the other pictures.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:35.520]   >> No, I bought a landscaper lawnmower, weed whacker, whatever it was. >> Good. >> Good.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.560]   >> Good. >> Good. See? That had worked. I take it, then you are not going to use your palm
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.800]   print to go into the Amazon Ghost Store. And by the way, it's not just Amazon Go.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.600]   They want to sell this to retailers everywhere. This is the new technology Amazon's proposing.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:54.080]   >> Yeah, let's give that to them, because they'd never use that at all.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:55:02.160]   >> But wait, so Apple's very clear-stated policy with biometrics, fingerprint, and face,
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:07.760]   is it never leaves the device, right? It's stored on... Well, you may not believe it.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.600]   I kind of do, because there's no reason for them to save it. They stored in the secure enclave.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:19.280]   There is a hash that's sent that is not reversible, can't be used to identify you.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:27.840]   But Amazon says, "To make sure it's safe, we encrypt the data and upload it to our servers."
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:34.560]   So they're making a virtue out of doing exactly the opposite of what Apple does.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.640]   >> I mean, there's the rub. It's kind of like, let's give you this biometric data.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.560]   We won't abuse it honestly, but oh, by the way, we just uploading it to our servers,
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.800]   but trust us on this one. >> Yeah, it's encrypted.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.960]   >> And if you're just like to have it, we'd sure just like to get you slowly accustomed to giving
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:53.280]   it to us and create the system where it's so convenient, where you can just pay with your hand.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.080]   That can't go wrong ever. >> To be smart, they probably don't need your hand.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.600]   They could do face recognition anyway, right? >> Oh, yeah, they already have that.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.480]   >> Yeah, but yeah, I mean, it's boiling the frog though.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.040]   >> Right. >> You know, I mean,
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.840]   which admittedly is a bad excuse because the experiment didn't work that way,
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.080]   but it is a good example. They're getting us used to it.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:21.760]   My niece, for example, is 22. She has no problems at all in posting all kinds of
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.720]   share of all kinds of personal information. You try and say, "Look,
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:28.720]   this isn't the way it needs to be, but maybe I'm just an old fart,
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.320]   but I just think the younger generation is getting seduced into this."
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.120]   And it's not a thing that you could roll back easily.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.720]   >> No, no.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.040]   >> And a number of people are quite rightly in the chatroom,
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:43.200]   quite rightly pointing out that I'm an older white cis man.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:48.160]   And so I have nothing to fear from the authorities who are also older white cis males.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:52.080]   >> Yeah, right. >> And so first they came for the socialist,
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:54.720]   and then they came for the trade unionist, and then the game for the Jews.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.960]   >> Yeah, just don't bank on that because it's not going to save you.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.800]   >> Well, I'm pretty safe. >> There's an irony.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:06.320]   >> But I would understand if you were a person of color or a woman or transgender,
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.240]   you might be very cautious about what you have released to the public.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.000]   And that I think is probably the right thing, the right point of view to take,
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.200]   because it's a risky world for some people.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:22.160]   But on the other hand, I'm safe, so I'm going to use it,
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:27.200]   because there is benefit. Although great article, I won't take a break,
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.480]   but I want to talk about this great article by Neil Seibert and above Abelon,
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.880]   in which he says, "You know those voice assistants, I said this four years ago," he says,
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:37.760]   "when they came out, they're not going anywhere."
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.800]   And I was right. It's the Apple Watch that's the big winner.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.960]   We'll get to that in just a second. We've got the fabulous Samonda Rush 4 here from Rocket.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.040]   She's a video producer at Polygon.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:54.880]   And if you've ever listened to Rocket on Relay FM, you know what a great show that is
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:59.280]   with Brianna Wu and Christina Warren, two of my other favorite people.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.600]   It's like the three of my three favorite people on that show.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.760]   So it's wonderful to have you on. Ian Thompson,
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:11.040]   key of the mustache, enjoy it while you've got it, because it's going,
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.040]   the registered dot-a-tongue.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:13.520]   >> You need the thot-a-tongue.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.360]   >> Yeah. But you look so Terry Thomas, I just love it.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.960]   >> You could put a little ding-dong.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:22.800]   Put a little gold gap. Get a little electrician's tape.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.040]   Just put a little gap in between your teeth right there.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.480]   >> Perfect.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.600]   >> Perfect.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.840]   And Alex Wilhelm from Tech Crunch.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.640]   Always nice to see you.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.080]   I think now that you've described the shed that you're in,
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.760]   I feel that this is almost a lie, this shot of you.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.560]   Like it's some book-lined library somewhere, but you're just really in a shed.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.400]   >> Oh, that's a pretty nice shed.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.920]   >> It's never mine.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.920]   >> Oh my god. It's gorgeous.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.240]   >> Well, the laptop is impinged by the mics and all that,
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.120]   so I can't really give you two.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.560]   But there's a day bed over there.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.360]   >> Oh my god.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.680]   >> Where you go, where Liza's had enough of you,
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.040]   and she says, "Just go to your shed."
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.840]   >> I mean, no, but how am I going to pen,
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.880]   I make, and I'm married, and it's great to have more than one space to be in.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.480]   >> It is really nice, I agree.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.280]   >> I hear that.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.720]   >> Can I come live in your shed?
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.720]   [laughter]
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.720]   >> I know.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.920]   >> You want to get to a home gym?
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.960]   >> I'm here.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.440]   >> There you go.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.120]   Simonka, be your adopted daughter.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:21.120]   She likes to read.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.800]   Look at all those books.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.480]   Have you read all those books, Alex?
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.520]   No, it's basically from here over as my section,
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.120]   and then Liza's Medical School Books are over there.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.400]   >> Oh, yeah, you don't need to read that.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.680]   >> It's 90% of our books in one set of notes.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:35.760]   >> Dilton.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:36.880]   >> So they're not really beautiful.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.600]   >> That's beautiful.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:37.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.280]   >> Great to have a photo.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.560]   >> The first time I did a photo,
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.680]   with a bookshelf by me, I had a younger reader just like,
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.200]   "There's no way you've read all those books."
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.440]   And so yeah, that's what we did pre-internet.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.000]   >> [laughs]
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.040]   >> You know, it's like, we actually read some pie paper.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   >> We read some pie paper.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.680]   [laughter]
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.760]   >> Actually, I just read this.
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.480]   The ebook loans to libraries.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.800]   You know, there's a couple of programs like Hoopla
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.720]   that allow you, if you have a library card to take out an ebook,
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.040]   up 52% this year.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.120]   Like it's suddenly got, which is great.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:11.920]   Isn't that good news?
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.200]   People are reading.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:13.520]   >> Yep.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.360]   >> And because they don't want to go to the library,
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.120]   they don't want to hold a physical book,
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.200]   they're taking advantage of this great audiobooks too,
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:19.920]   from your local library.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.000]   >> But libraries are great for that sort of thing.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.960]   I've never understood why libraries are so distant
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.240]   in the United States.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.760]   Because I mean, they have ebooks, they have audiobooks.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.240]   Hell, you can even go into them in pre-COVID days
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.680]   and get some great stuff.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.880]   Libraries are an absolutely essential public resource.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.000]   Use these things.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:38.880]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.440]   I have to say reading this article about this
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.880]   Aryan Marshall in Wired, I was a little disappointed.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.880]   Apparently, you know, if a library buys a physical book,
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.640]   I presume they pay the normal price,
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.320]   and they can lend it out as long as that book
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.640]   doesn't fall into pieces, right?
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.000]   But with digital books, the publishers charge them a hefty fee.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.360]   The average is $40.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.160]   And then severely limit how many times they can lend it.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.120]   Sometimes it's only 26 times or 52 times.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.880]   Sometimes it says for two years.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.520]   So it's not as economical for a library to buy these ebooks.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.960]   >> It's even worse with audiobooks,
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.280]   because I mean, certainly San Francisco Public Library
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.360]   doesn't allow you to renew audiobooks.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.480]   My wife uses them a lot on her commuting to work.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.400]   And one audiobook she's got is 42 hours long,
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.480]   and she has to return it with it for two weeks.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.440]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.440]   >> What the fuck is that?
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.880]   42 hours, my God.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.600]   >> Lots of books.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.040]   >> Lots of books.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:41.840]   >> Lots of books.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.760]   >> It's almost Picassie, but yes, it's--
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.040]   >> Oh, yes, capitalism.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.360]   I have all the Piccetti books.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.720]   I think they're fascinating.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.200]   >> He's a pretty good writer.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.560]   >> Yeah, it's good, because when you have 42 hours on capitalism,
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.680]   capital and ideology, you better be well-written.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.280]   >> 30 years on capitalism, baby.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.160]   That's nothing.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.120]   >> Better be well-written.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.360]   Let's see, what else do I have?
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.880]   >> I have a lot of really long books.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.640]   Gravity's Rainbow, Infinite Jest, the Infinite Book.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.680]   >> Oh, Gravity's right.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.360]   >> Are you a 19-year-old student?
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.880]   I have an university right now, Leo.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.440]   >> Wait, you have the e-book of Infinite Jest?
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.560]   >> No, audio book.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.120]   >> Audio book.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:19.680]   >> Oh, audio book.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.160]   >> Yeah, how long?
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.800]   >> You actually have the e-book, too,
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.400]   because I like to read while I listen.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.720]   Piccetti's capital and ideology is 49 hours.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.160]   >> Oh, God.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.720]   >> Oh!
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:28.720]   >> Ow!
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:28.720]   >> Ow!
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.680]   >> Ow!
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.360]   >> I've tried Gravity's Rainbow five times.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.240]   >> Oh, I love that book.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.680]   >> Still can't get my head around it.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.040]   >> Oh, it's one of my favorite books.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.680]   >> It's just one of those things where you read it,
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.680]   and you think, I must be missing something.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.560]   I've got to be missing.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.280]   No, no, no, I am missing something.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.680]   >> It's like the wire.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.400]   >> It's crazy.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.600]   >> Yeah, it's like the wire.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.720]   >> Well, I guess so.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.760]   >> I was listening to this podcast called The Spouter In,
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.280]   which is a literature podcast.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.640]   And they actually recommend,
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.720]   if you're really, really struggling with a book,
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.240]   just read it backwards,
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.480]   open it up to a random page and read from there,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.800]   and just completely throw an ology out.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.840]   >> Is that the word?
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.880]   That was a word.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.200]   >> No, not like that.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.040]   >> Oh, that's the Klingon version.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.480]   >> That's a really interesting idea.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   >> Like, just read a random chapter?
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.880]   Seems like it would destroy the structure of the book.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.080]   >> Yes, but if what you want is to help yourself get into the book,
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.680]   you can't necessarily,
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.560]   like, don't hold yourself to the pressure of slogging
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.920]   through the first five chapters.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.320]   Make it a project that's different.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:30.960]   Go through the middle.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.320]   See if the middle's interesting.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:32.880]   Try the end.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.080]   See if the end is interesting.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.960]   And then when you get to a point where you can read it,
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.240]   go back and read it from the side.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.640]   >> That kind of makes sense if it's nonfiction.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.520]   But fiction, that really gets spoiled.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.480]   >> I mean, but what is being spoiled?
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.000]   If you're so bored,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.680]   you can't get through the beginning of a book.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.880]   >> Okay, fair enough.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.520]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.400]   Fair enough.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   >> I'm trying it with Nightwood by Juna Barnes right now,
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.160]   and it's actually not helping in this case.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.160]   Is this a difficult book for me?
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.720]   >> But I'm reading it backwards.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.920]   >> Just don't read Game of Thrones from the end to the beginning,
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.960]   or you'll be very buzzed.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.840]   >> That would ruin it.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.640]   >> It would ruin it.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.320]   It would get better as it went,
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.040]   because the first book in the Song of Ice and Fire
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.640]   is the best of the whole group.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.840]   >> So, you see,
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.360]   I tried to read Game of Thrones,
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.320]   and I was kind of,
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.080]   it was the same with Tolkien,
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.880]   with Lord of the Rings, same with Jude.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.240]   >> Oh, I sure, it was just like --
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.760]   >> Yeah, this is wrong.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.840]   >> It was just like, get on with the story.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.680]   >> Yeah, I cannot deal with those books.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.400]   >> I think that genuinely is one.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.480]   Like, when I started Game of Thrones,
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:37.600]   I was very overwhelmed by all the names and roles and everything.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.640]   But once you get the Stockholm syndrome,
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.560]   that makes you a bit too loud.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.000]   It's a delight.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.360]   I love those books now.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.360]   >> I should point out that the Nobel Committee
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.760]   agrees with you Ian Thompson.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.160]   J.R. Tolkien was rejected for a Nobel Prize
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.240]   because of poor storytelling and bad writing.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.840]   >> Well, I'm sorry.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.120]   Okay, the hope it works because it's a children's book.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.720]   But Lord of the Rings, it's just --
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.400]   I mean, don't get me wrong.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.080]   My sister loved the whole series.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.040]   She learned Elvis.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.040]   She read the summary and the whole thing.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.600]   But I tried to read Lord of the Rings.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.000]   I've tried again and again and again.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.560]   And it's just like, get on with it.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.760]   And I kind of think that Peter Jackson got the film just right
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.280]   with the endless endings.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.880]   I assume that was a homage to the fact that J.R.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.200]   Tolkien just really couldn't write good hard post fiction.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.640]   >> I will not listen to commentary on man who thinks
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.560]   that civilization into Bissiv II,
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.440]   because the show's not really taste old class.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.400]   And therefore, all of this builds and garbage and detritus
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.280]   that shall leave behind me as I go back and re-re-return
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.840]   to the king for the 88th time because it's fantastic.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.440]   Ian, our friendship is over.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.200]   >> I will hunt you down and kill you for that.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.840]   >> Well, I just want to say I'm hearing in my year
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.840]   a lot of our listeners saying get on with it.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.480]   So I am going to move on.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.840]   But I have to say this has been the most discursive
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.360]   rat hole filled show we have ever done.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.480]   And I'm loving it.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.800]   >> I've got to say, oh, my, the IRC chat room really has blown up
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.600]   over this one.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.840]   >> You start discing--
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.760]   >> I have to apologize, I think, apparently to do.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.760]   >> Oh, it's not that.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.080]   It's the Civ II thing that's really pissing them off.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.240]   I've tried to play Civ so many times and I just can't do it,
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.800]   but I've never tried Civ-Realization II.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.280]   So maybe I just didn't go far enough back.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.960]   So I will try.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.760]   >> Well, I mean, okay.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.800]   Civ I was basic.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.840]   Civ II was--
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.240]   it pretty much covers a thing.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.120]   After Civ III was terrible.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.320]   Civ IV bit better.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.520]   Civ V ever had better.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.080]   But it was just the pure empire building game.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:54.320]   If you're looking to spend 10 hours on a computer game,
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.680]   building up a world civilization,
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.080]   heading out 12th century, it was a great game.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:03.600]   But I'm sure someone is better on me than this,
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.080]   but it was the same problem when they rebooted Elite,
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.280]   where you've got to spend such a long time learning to play the game.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.440]   And I would say also stream,
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.320]   stop telling people how long you spent playing this game.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.920]   Because when I look at that, it's just like,
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.240]   I spent way too long playing this.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.520]   I need to get out and have a life.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.440]   >> I'm an age of empires guy.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.720]   >> There we go.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.920]   >> AO2 is really hard.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.640]   >> I like real time as opposed to turn based, for some reason.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.000]   It's just something about turn based.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.440]   It's like it's too much like chess.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.000]   >> There are some savage AO2 players online as well though,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.720]   because I got my backslide handed to me like a redoed as stepchild
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.680]   by some of those people.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.240]   >> Oh, I bet.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.800]   >> They will just go out and beat you into the ground
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.320]   and laugh at you what they do it.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:55.120]   >> I watched them into empires to esports,
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.200]   and I was blown away with the quality of play.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.200]   I thought I was pretty good back in the day,
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.640]   with my choco news and so forth.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.960]   But like, oh my gosh, the amazing, amazing stuff.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.080]   I know we need to go to an ad,
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.600]   but whenever an age of empires to comes up,
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.400]   my nerd spines to start to tingle.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.520]   >> Are they re-releasing that or have they done it?
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.360]   >> They are doing AOE4, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.800]   >> AOE4?
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.760]   >> But they were releasing age of empires too.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.440]   >> They did a definitive edition.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.280]   >> They did an HD edition of that,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.800]   and you can get that right now.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.600]   But apparently, Relik is working on an entirely new AOE version 4.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.720]   I'm thinking this might be an Xbox exclusive, I don't know.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.080]   >> Oh, I came out here.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.200]   >> I may need to check some days on the whole day for that,
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.080]   because that looks very interesting.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.720]   >> Are you doing Crusader Kings 3, though, Ian?
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.120]   >> No, I have two.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.240]   >> Oh my God, I'm an idiot.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.320]   >> It's Crusader Kings good, because I've heard mixed reviews.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.840]   >> I've heard only incredible things.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.160]   I've heard it's somewhat like playing a spreadsheet,
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.120]   but that the-
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.800]   >> Oh, it's just what I'm looking for.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.400]   >> I'm looking to accomplish what the AI is so much beyond the first game,
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.400]   and I need to get into it.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.280]   >> I'm playing a springtime.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.120]   >> All the why they have focus now, what happened?
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.640]   >> Yeah, I was about to tell you that quietly.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.600]   See if you can fix it.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.160]   >> Look at me.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.360]   >> Please look at me carefully.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   >> Let me tell the world about Zipperkruder
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.800]   while you fix your focus.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.880]   >> Or not.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.600]   Oh, that's good.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.000]   All you have to do is get closer.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.680]   That's all terrifying.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.760]   Terrifying.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.240]   >> Oh, Lord.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.120]   [Laughter]
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.880]   >> I'm going to get a fan.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.200]   >> Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.760]   "If you're hiring, God bless you.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.120]   We need more people offering more jobs,
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.800]   and there is no better way to do it."
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.440]   Look, this is a good time to be hiring.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.920]   The best people are looking for work,
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.880]   and you can spread the word that you're hiring
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.280]   better with Zipperkruder than anywhere else.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.760]   Post immediately to 100 plus job boards
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.080]   with one posting to Zipperkruder.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.240]   And one of the amazing things that happens,
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.720]   what happened to us, we use Zipperkruder all the time,
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.320]   is you will start getting candidates almost immediately,
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.640]   because what they do is they look at your listing,
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.960]   they scan through the resumes they've got on file,
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.440]   and then they invite people with the right qualifications
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.600]   to apply to your job.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.240]   Let me tell you, that really works.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.520]   Zipperkruder is so effective,
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.640]   four out of five employers who post on Zipperkruder
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.360]   get a quality candidate within the first day.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.520]   We, last time we were looking for a bookkeeper,
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.480]   we posted on Zipperkruder at breakfast,
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.600]   Lisa was worried because she thought
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.880]   she was going to have to do the bookkeeping,
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.320]   and she was dreading it.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.840]   Plus, hiring is hard, right?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.600]   You've got to look at a lot of resumes.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.240]   She posted it at breakfast by lunchtime.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.600]   In fact, within an hour, she goes,
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.040]   "Oh, here's a good, here's a good candidate."
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.320]   "Oh my God, there's another one."
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.640]   We had three or four really qualified candidates
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   by lunchtime, that is an amazing thing.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.000]   We're not alone.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.560]   Zipperkruder talks about Monica Starks,
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.160]   maybe you saw this in the ad.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.360]   She was hiring for a key role at her construction company,
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.080]   GS Group.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.080]   There were so many candidates out there,
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.840]   but she couldn't find the right person,
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.040]   so she switched.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.360]   And I think if you're using some other service,
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.520]   switching to Zipperkruder is a really good idea,
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.680]   because they make hiring so easy.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.720]   Monica found a guy, Le Mans Jenkins, almost immediately.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.720]   If she said Zipperkruder sent Le Mans profile to her
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.520]   five minutes after she posted her job,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.240]   because he was such a perfect match for the role.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.640]   And she agreed, hired him, and it's working out great.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.320]   Zipperkruder makes the entire process efficient and effective.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.800]   You don't get calls to your phone,
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.760]   you don't get emails.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.440]   It all goes into Zipperkruder's interface.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.360]   They reformat the resumes,
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.560]   so you can scan them quickly,
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.960]   you can write screening questions, multiple choice,
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.200]   or true/false, even essay questions,
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.600]   to filter out candidates that just don't fit.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.080]   And then Zipperkruder ranks them,
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.000]   rates them, and you can hire the right person fast.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.120]   There's nothing better.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.240]   See for yourself, you can try Zipperkruder for free right now.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.400]   If you go to zipperkruder.com/twit,
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   that's zipperkruder.com/twit,
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.280]   Zipperkruder is the smartest way to hire.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.120]   You can take it from me, we've been doing it for years.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.600]   That's zipperkruder.com/twit.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.120]   Zipperkruder?
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.520]   Oh, now I lost track of all the things we were going to talk about.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.200]   All right, did anybody watch the Google announcement on Wednesday?
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:21.680]   Anybody?
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:25.920]   I did, and I have to say I was distinctly less than impressed.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:32.480]   You know, they all kind of telegraphed it by calling it launch night in,
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.000]   even though it was 11 in the morning.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.120]   Rick Osterlow, the vice president of hardware,
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:43.360]   was like in his socks on a sofa, practically slumping down.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.200]   Did he show his feet on stream?
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.680]   I can't remember why.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.080]   I don't, he might have.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.880]   They were really pushing where your socks.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.840]   I mean, better than not wearing socks.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.520]   It was the strangest.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:04.160]   It was the most low energy event I've ever seen.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.480]   You know, usually when a company's doing these events,
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.400]   this is a big deal.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.120]   This is, you know, they put on the pizzazz.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.280]   They try to sell you on the product.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.320]   The Pixel 5 was like, yeah, we got this phone.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.080]   Are they done doing hardware?
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.520]   Is that the way they're doing the stuff?
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.080]   They're doing the stuff.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.760]   I feel like they got, so Google I/O, which is supposed to be in May,
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.080]   COVID hits, they go, yeah, yeah, we're not going to do it.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.400]   Everybody else did a virtual developers event.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.080]   Google just said, yeah, no.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.000]   They didn't say we'll do it later.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.880]   They didn't say we'll just don't have the energy.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.160]   When I first saw the tech specs of the new phones,
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.160]   I was kind of like, oh, they're going back to the next
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.760]   society here where you do cheap, clean hardware,
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.160]   which gets proper updates and gets you an unskinned version of Android.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.600]   But the choices they made were bizarre.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.560]   You know, you downgrade the central processor.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.720]   You know, you keep the camera as it is.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.960]   Yeah, you add some cute software functions,
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.840]   but it was kind of like, what was the point?
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.560]   You know, I mean, you're just doing this for the sake of it.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.120]   It really feels like I'm going to make a guess.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.120]   This was the last phone in the pipeline.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.760]   And it's like, they're so done with the whole thing.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.520]   They're just going to push it out.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.280]   And they'll never do another phone again.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.640]   I just feels like that.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.320]   They also really muddied the water.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.320]   So for instance, they announced the 4A to a very good reception.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.600]   I think that's an excellent phone.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.280]   That was the success of the Pixel 4 a couple of months ago.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.320]   Everybody loves it.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.880]   But then this week, they announced the 4A5G,
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.920]   which is not even related to the 4A.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.920]   It really looks like a 5A.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:49.920]   Because it has 5A features, not 4A features.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.480]   The 5A, they didn't even normally do a 5 and a 5XL.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.600]   They didn't do an XL.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.520]   They did one model.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.200]   It's mid-range E.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.640]   It's still 700 bucks.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:05.120]   But it's kind of a mid-range in every other respect.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.400]   It's got a big battery, but only 128GB storage.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.000]   There's no other SKUs, 8GB of RAM.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.240]   One thing that I think is good, it's a metal-back,
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.200]   hallelujah.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.360]   These glass backs are so fragile.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.040]   And it still does wireless charging,
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.000]   which I had thought, oh, you can't do it with metal.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.800]   That's why everybody makes these glass-backed phones.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.920]   So that's encouraging.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.440]   The camera is probably identical to the old one pretty much.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:39.120]   It's got better software, but it's still the same hardware.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.040]   But I'm a 3A user.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.800]   I've been using Google phone since the original Nexus.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.320]   There is nothing in there that would make you want to upgrade.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.680]   Yeah, the whole feature.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.800]   But that's a software feature.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.880]   That would come to the rest of the phone sooner or later.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880]   Yeah, that was the only thing they could say.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.760]   Was that--
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.520]   And I bet it doesn't work all that well.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.640]   But if a company puts you on hold on their service line,
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.440]   you tell the phone, just tell me when somebody gets on.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.640]   That's the lamest feature.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.920]   That's not that good.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.280]   That was the total selling point.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.640]   It was a whole lot of phone calls.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.200]   It was a lot of phone calls.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.240]   I always take it.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.200]   I don't want that.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.320]   I was already smart.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.920]   Mark Lavoy, the guy would charge a photography,
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.440]   had left, he's gone to Adobe.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.560]   I just feel like they've kind of lost their mojo.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.280]   Go ahead, Simone.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.800]   Do you think there's anything about these phones?
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.760]   Obviously, there's no new features for existing pixel users.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:37.120]   But do you think there's anything that would make Apple or Samsung users hop the fence?
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:37.840]   No.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.120]   I guess that's my point.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:43.840]   They weren't able to say, "Here's a phone you're going to want in any respect."
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.320]   It's 5G.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.680]   But who cares?
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.800]   Every phone's 5G.
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.680]   It's a phone.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.880]   It was kind of like that.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.800]   They spent very little time on it.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.920]   Here's the phone.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.760]   And there's only two colors for the 5, right?
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.760]   They're just like, "Yeah, flag and green."
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.720]   I'd say one of the key things that keeps me buying these phones
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.280]   is that you get your security updates first.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.480]   I wouldn't be comfortable buying a Samsung Android phone
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.080]   because you're reliant on Samsung to get the security fixes out there.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.280]   So I'll carry on buying from Google directly from that.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.960]   But this was just...
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.920]   Even the Chromecast unit was painfully bad.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.880]   And I don't know what it is about Google,
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.680]   but they love beige for some reason.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:26.880]   That's not a good look.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.360]   They have...
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.160]   It's pastel.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.960]   They do have a mint green one and a pink one.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.840]   They put them on a plate of French macaron cookies,
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.720]   which it does look like.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.480]   And then they said it's like a bowl of candy.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.000]   So it was very confusing.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.880]   I bought one that day and I got it the next day, by the way.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.520]   And it's great.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.000]   It's fine.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:46.880]   It's another Chromecast.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:50.320]   Remember when they first released Google TV,
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.520]   it was called Google TV.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.720]   It came with a keyboard.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.200]   Remember that?
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.240]   And...
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.280]   Oh, I hated that thing.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:57.760]   It was.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.560]   It had problems.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.200]   And then they had so many problems.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.680]   They said, "Okay, what's Android TV?"
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.720]   They're all new, different.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.400]   And it's been Android TV.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.240]   Now they're back to Google TV.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.960]   It's...
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.760]   You know what?
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.760]   It's only 49 bucks.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:19.120]   And in fact, if you subscribe to YouTube TV,
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.560]   I think for six months, it's free.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.400]   So they're basically...
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.600]   They're basically giving it away.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.360]   It has a remote, which the Chromecast hasn't had ever.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.280]   Yes.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.880]   I feel like Google's a company that had some really great ideas
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.720]   and has been since making all of them worse.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.760]   Is that a fair thing?
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.440]   Like, search used to be amazingly good.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.000]   And then they put all the ads on top now and disguised them as results.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.160]   And out of the other crap and cruffs, you can't find your results.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.920]   Like, they made phones for a while and that was cool.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.360]   And Android was cool for a while.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.880]   And now it's just super insecure and sh*t.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.000]   And like, I feel like everything they've done has just gotten worse.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.600]   Is that because they lose interest?
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.160]   It really is apparent they've lost interest.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.880]   To me, maybe I might just be projecting because I've lost interest.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.240]   What are you seeing them being interested in, if not the phones?
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.000]   Like, what do you think their new area of focus is?
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   That's a great question.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:06.720]   The YouTube algorithm.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:11.360]   That is the 20 billion dollar question because,
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.000]   yeah, honestly, the Nexus series is a really good series of phones.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.440]   It was, I love them.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.960]   Search used to be great.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:25.200]   My father-in-law bought a smartphone because he saw me doing voice search on
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.560]   Android and saying, "Where is the nearest pub in Buxton?"
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.640]   And he was just like, "This is amazing.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.920]   I need to get this."
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.080]   But there is nothing like that anymore.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.400]   I mean, Google seems to have given up on the plot and I don't understand why.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.200]   They released a bigger speaker.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.720]   "Hoo-hoo, great. Hold the front page."
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.680]   It's not even attractive.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.440]   You know how we feel about the first speaker.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.160]   It's kind of a lozenge.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:52.640]   Come on.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:57.200]   Yeah, you guys aren't going to buy it, are you?
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.560]   Does it help?
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.200]   I mean, no.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.760]   Does it help that a stoned Mark Ronson was pitching it?
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.360]   That doesn't hurt, I think.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:11.040]   What do you, now, I don't want to be judgey, except I obviously am.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.640]   Oh, I do.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.440]   Did you, so you watched the end, did you notice Mark Ronson?
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.960]   Did he seem a little, I don't know,
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.280]   Hi?
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:23.840]   I wouldn't like to comment on someone's mental stay.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.960]   He might just be like that.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.200]   Under the current circumstances, no one's operating 100%.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.000]   Okay, fair.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.280]   And particularly when it comes to public things, but it was just snooze-worthy.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:41.840]   I mean, it was, it reminded me of the old onion article after Steve Jobs died and Tim Cook did his first keynote.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.000]   And it was like, Tim Cook comes on, says, "Here's a phone.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.360]   It does some great things.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:47.760]   Great.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.720]   Okay, next."
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:53.200]   It was a very feeling like that.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.680]   And there was no enthusiasm.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.440]   There was no hardware to really get you enthusiastic.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.000]   The software was cute, but there's nothing world-changing there.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.280]   So I saw no reason to get excited.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:12.080]   Well, Ian, do you think that the event would have been this underwhelming in a normal year?
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.960]   Or is it exacerbated by the pandemic?
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.480]   It must be the pandemic.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.040]   Well, you see, I mean, well, no, you see, I was at the Pixel 1 and 2 launches.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.160]   Then we, we pissed off Google and they stopped inviting us.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:30.880]   But, you know, with the original, you know, there was actually a feeling of excitement.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:36.720]   Then they went on to Apple's mode of software, Brenda, and had people in the back cheerleading.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.920]   So whenever somebody said something, there was always some people going,
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.760]   "Woo-hoo, yeah, yay!"
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.360]   Having multiple orgasms throughout.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:50.320]   But, I mean, honestly, they were good events because they allowed you to get hands-on with a kit.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.640]   And one thing Google does, which I respect, which Apple doesn't do,
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:59.760]   Apple farms these out to useful idiots who will always say what they want to say.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.320]   Google actually put it out there and let you get your hands on it.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.520]   And that's how you pissed off.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.680]   Well, yeah, but, I mean, at the same time, they were honest about it.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:17.280]   So, I kind of respect it, but at the same time, this was just really underwhelming.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:22.320]   I couldn't work out why they made such a big deal about it because they were putting out
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:29.440]   flawed hardware, a few cute software tips, but it just really wasn't that confusing.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.360]   There was nothing there to get you fired up.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.600]   It was very googly in the sense that, for instance,
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:39.040]   even though they're going to call his Chromecast Google TV, Android TV still exists,
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:42.880]   you may remember that when they released Stadia,
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:47.440]   and you bought the early adopter kit, it came with a Chromecast Ultra,
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.680]   so you could play their gaming service on your big screen TV with a Chromecast,
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.400]   except this new Chromecast doesn't work with Stadia.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.680]   It's like-
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.600]   That was absolutely bizarre.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:03.120]   Stadia is, you know, this is where they can make some really big bucks in the future.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.920]   They released hardware which doesn't support it.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:11.680]   I mean, I'm curious. I mean, what everyone else thinks, because that seemed suicide.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.120]   It's just strange.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.320]   It's nonsensical.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.440]   Yeah, I have no good answer for that.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:22.640]   If they're really trying to make Stadia a thing, which it already is kind of not,
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:28.000]   like they're suddenly trying to make that a thing, and not releasing it or not having Chromecast
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.800]   be compatible with it is just nonsensical. I don't understand it.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:35.440]   I can only speculate, but one of the things that's always been said about Google is,
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.040]   because they want to keep their startup energy.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.680]   They have- every division is somewhat autonomous.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:48.000]   And so maybe it's that the new Chromecast division wasn't talking to the Stadia division,
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.400]   or they just didn't pay attention to anything else the company's doing.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.880]   But I have to say, and I love Google, and I am not unlike you guys.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.760]   I'm not an anti-Google person. I really-
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.520]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.320]   Pause, pause. I'll give Google a shout out right now.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.640]   Google recently brought back Google Finance to some degree, and I want to give them points for that.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.720]   I use Chrome every single day. I live inside of a Google search environment.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.160]   I'm on G Suite. I critique because I use-
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:20.960]   Yes.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.000]   But I use that stuff day and day out.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.360]   I'd be willing to bet you're not going to rely on Google Finance,
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.440]   because who knows how long it'll be around?
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.320]   Well, Yahoo Finance is part of the broader Verizon media group, Umbrella of Brands.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.840]   Leo, so I should have to help you.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.760]   Yahoo. I use whatever I want.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.880]   I just want to say to you, and I hope you'll relay this along to the people in charge,
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.240]   I have used Yahoo Finance for 20 years now.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.600]   And nothing.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.080]   That's it?
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.760]   Hey.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.520]   Leo, the people of Howard don't know that I just-
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.600]   You are real and you exist.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:58.800]   I am real, and I exist, and I use Yahoo Finance.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:05.360]   But Google's starting to live up to its reputation as a company that has no attention span,
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:10.000]   that just kind of random walks its way into the future,
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.400]   that cancels things willy-nilly.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:20.800]   If you're interested in investing your time and energy into a Google product,
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.440]   you always have to say, "Well, I wonder if it's worth it, because will it be around next year?"
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.400]   This is a problem, I think, for Google.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.840]   Microsoft and Mixer, same thing.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:35.040]   I can't believe they built Mixer up, got Ninja to join the platform, spent all the money,
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.880]   and then six weeks later, gave up on it.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:37.920]   How does a company do that?
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:38.720]   It's so embarrassing.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.000]   He didn't tell Ninja beforehand.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.840]   That was ridiculous.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.640]   He did all right.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.720]   I mean, yeah, he's fine.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.120]   He's fine.
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.400]   How much money do they pay Ninja?
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:52.320]   Like 20 million, and then so he leaves Twitch, he goes to Mixer, stays for a few months,
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:55.360]   Mixer goes under, he keeps the money, goes back to Twitch.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.920]   Oh, and by the way, apparently it's leaked that Twitch gave him a big bonus to come back.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.000]   So the guy did nothing.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.840]   If only I had more hair, then I could become a YouTuber.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.840]   I don't feel bad for Ninja at any point in the game.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:15.680]   I just think it's rude and an oversight to not tell your theoretical, the theoretical star of
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.320]   your platform.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.480]   Like, oh, by the way, we're shutting that ***** stuff down.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.200]   It is weird.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:19.840]   I didn't know it.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.560]   My swan.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.400]   Simone de Roche for.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.280]   Oh, no.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.320]   You're allowed to say "merid," however.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.160]   We're shutting that mare down.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.760]   No, no, no, no.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.000]   Sorry.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:30.800]   Apologies.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:35.600]   Seriously, Simone, one thing I've learned from Twitch is swearing your own language.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.600]   So, you know, I can say "wanker" on here.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.160]   Yeah, you can.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.600]   I can say "wanker, wanker, wanker."
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.160]   All you want.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.520]   They can't say in the chat room apparently.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:43.920]   That's what's going on.
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.400]   Something happens.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:50.480]   It's "poutine."
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.040]   No, it's not.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.520]   We do have French listeners and I don't want them to have to wash my ears out with soap.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.400]   They're so hairy.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.200]   It will be hard.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.880]   You need shampoo in there and conditioner.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.440]   Yes.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.400]   Conditioner for sure.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.160]   I don't want to be too hard.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.400]   Actually, I like the Chromecast.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.560]   It's 49 bucks.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:13.440]   It's a credible streaming device at a price much lower than anything except the lowest cost
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.480]   virus TV sticker.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.400]   This is the Roku.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.520]   Can they have a $50 Roku?
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.000]   They have a $50 Roku.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.640]   But it doesn't do 4K HDR.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   Okay, that's fair.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.240]   And now it doesn't do HBO Max or HBO Go.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:26.880]   So...
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.600]   Actually, this was one thing I was very pleased because I have a shield and a video
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.080]   shield which is I think a great Android TV device and I couldn't get HBO to work on it
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.080]   because I think just like Roku, they hadn't made a deal.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.200]   Maybe Google loosened the things up with this new Chromecast because it does
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.800]   support HBO Max and then I went over my shield and it's supporting it now.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.840]   So that's good news.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.440]   They must have made a deal.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.120]   Anyway.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.920]   Somebody in the chat were saying you could say...
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.400]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.240]   You wish.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.920]   That's not really a good substitute for an PS4 though.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:27:59.920]   No.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.520]   Holy blue.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:01.840]   What?
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.280]   What?
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.640]   By the way, Sonos is suing Google.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.280]   They started this process in January.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:12.880]   They're suing them for another five more patents.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:19.840]   Because they say, "Hey, we invented this party mode, this multi-speaker audio and you're copying us,
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.840]   I guess." I'll be interested to watch that.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.000]   That was the thing that made Sonos, right?
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.240]   They were the only ones who could do this and now everybody could do it.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:34.080]   And if that's a question of like leveraging Sonos' patents without paying them,
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.440]   then I don't blame Sonos because it's frankly nobody's going to ever buy another Sonos speaker again.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.080]   Why would you?
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.640]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.080]   Because they don't come with Google Home built in, so they're not going to spy on me.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:46.720]   Actually, they do.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.160]   That's actually a reason it does.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.120]   But you have to turn it on.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.400]   If you get a Sonos one, you can have Alexa or, I mean, Echo or Google on it.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.920]   But you don't have to and you can turn it off.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:56.720]   So yeah.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.480]   That's a feature right there that I pay for.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:04.080]   I mean, my wife wants to get Sonos for that reason because it doesn't have the evil little robots inside listening to you.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.200]   Now, I've got the same problem.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:12.480]   I want to buy a home security system, but I'm not going to go with Ring because I don't like their corporate policies.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.360]   So where do I go?
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:13.920]   Good man.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.920]   I end up trading my Ring in for Google for a day.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:18.480]   Hello.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.280]   And that's Tello.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:19.760]   The Oak.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.160]   Frying Pan.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:22.800]   Fire.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.320]   I don't know anything.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.440]   I don't know anything.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.720]   There are no good choices.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.760]   I think that's kind of the underlying message of this episode of Twit.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.080]   Well, now I replaced all my home networking.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:39.120]   I took everything out and put Enterprise Grade Ubiquity in there and they support cameras.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:44.880]   So and it would record locally and see, you know, I could put a little hard drive in the router and would record locally instead of sending it to the cloud.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.600]   So maybe I'll do that.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:48.000]   I don't know.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.040]   It seems like a lot of trouble.
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:53.600]   They even have a doorbell and again, all that stuff.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.320]   Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.320]   Where's my iPhone SE?
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.640]   I am such a fan of Mint Mobile.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:06.000]   And perhaps you've seen Ryan Reynolds talking up the Mint Mobile.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.320]   It's pretty cool when you got Deadpool doing your ads.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.760]   That's all I can say.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:13.840]   Mint Mobile is the MVNO.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:24.880]   These are, you know, MVNO's like Mint Mobile, they resell the expensive sell carriers plans for a lot less.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.760]   They're reselling T-Mobile.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:32.480]   So if T-Mobile works well in your neck of the woods, Mint Mobile will work exactly the same.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.920]   But a lot less?
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.960]   Yes.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:40.640]   I mean, I cut my T-Mobile bill by two-thirds by going to Mint Mobile.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.920]   They just introduced their unlimited data plan.
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:51.840]   So this is unlimited nationwide talk and text, high-speed data on the nation's largest 5G network,
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:58.560]   unlimited 30 bucks a month, 30 bucks a month.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.440]   The whole thing.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.080]   Add an iPhone.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:04.320]   That's another 15 bucks for 45 bucks for half what I'm paying T-Mobile.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   I get a phone and unlimited.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.920]   It's amazing.
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.040]   Now, I actually went for the 12 gigabyte a month plan.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.240]   That's 25 bucks a month.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:16.720]   But next when that, you know, you bought a year ahead of time, when that runs out, I'm going unlimited.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:17.760]   That's just awesome.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:25.520]   What's awful is the price I pay Verizon, because my wife and family on Verizon, AT&T,
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:30.240]   because my second family is on AT&T, and T-Mobile, because I'm on T-Mobile.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.200]   And my mom's on sprint.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.120]   So pretty much I pay so much through the nose to all these guys.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.480]   I'm moving them all to Mint Mobile.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.480]   Consider yourself warm.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.400]   30 bucks a month.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.720]   Mint Mobile doesn't have the stores.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:49.760]   So by going online only, eliminating the traditional cost of retail, they can save a lot.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.920]   You can bring your own phone.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.440]   They will send the sim to your door.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.120]   They don't charge you for the sim.
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:59.280]   Keep your same phone number, all your contacts, or buy a phone from them.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.080]   And you'll see the iPhone SE is a great price.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.240]   I think it's a great phone too.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.440]   I think it's a great choice.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:10.400]   If you're looking for a plan for family members, Mint Mobile's awesome.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:15.920]   And if you're not 100% satisfied, of course, Mint Mobile has you covered with a 7-day money
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:16.800]   back guarantee.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.280]   Time to break up with big wireless.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.840]   Those guys, they don't love you back.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.640]   Mint Mobile, the little green fox, he loves you.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:29.280]   Switched to Mint Mobile's premium unlimited data plan for 30 bucks a month.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:32.960]   And they'll send you this plan for free, or you can get a phone from them.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:35.280]   Go to mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.360]   This is the best deal in mobile.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.320]   It's amazing.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.960]   mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.880]   Cut your unlimited wireless bill to $30 a month.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.400]   I don't know why you'd go with anybody else.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.600]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.040]   And it's minty fresh.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.800]   And tasty.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.160]   Tasty.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:00.720]   So what do you make of Facebook's announced plan?
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.680]   I have a feeling.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.360]   This is my thinking is we got an election of November 3.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:08.720]   There'll be a transition period.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:10.320]   January 20.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.040]   There's a chance at this point, a pretty good chance.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:17.680]   We'll have a new administration, maybe administration that won't be as easy
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:23.920]   on antitrust regulations and FCC that might not be as amenable.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:30.160]   And maybe even a Congress that's a little less worried about things.
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:36.320]   And I feel like you're going to see companies go, if we're going to do this, it's now or never.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:43.840]   So Facebook, which has been under a modicum of inspection by Congress, but mostly by Democrats,
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:48.320]   they seem to, the Republicans in the presidency, pretty happy with Facebook.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:54.240]   They've decided to make one account for everything.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.760]   Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:01.680]   They're going to basically merge or interoperate the apps.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:03.280]   There'll be a single login.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.320]   I feel like this is the kind of thing that might have raised some scrutiny in the past.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.760]   I feel like they're doing it now.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.120]   And now, how don't you follow finance?
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.520]   They're doing it now because they figure it's now or never.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.560]   Does that seem sensible?
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:20.000]   I think it's defensive because if the accounts were all separated,
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.840]   your Instagram account was different than your WhatsApp account,
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.440]   which is different than your Facebook account,
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.680]   Congress could say, "Look, just cleave here.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:27.200]   You can keep two pieces, exactly."
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:32.080]   But now Facebook can say, "Guys, gosh, we'd love to.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.200]   What a great idea.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.880]   You've had two bad notes, all one account.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.160]   You can't just cut off one piece.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.120]   It's like cutting off your arm.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:38.400]   It's part of your body."
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:45.440]   So now, they're going to be better armored against a questing democratic administration
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.960]   and maybe a democratic senate.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.080]   And it's a smart move by Facebook if you believe in their model and Zuckerberg's leadership.
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.400]   If you're critical of those things, it's not particularly good news.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.640]   Remember that it was about a year ago,
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:01.840]   Zuck posted that blog post where he said, "We're going to make Facebook private.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.440]   We're going to encrypt all the messages.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.840]   This would also be a step forward in that direction."
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.320]   Right?
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.960]   And maybe for that reason, a good thing.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.480]   Yes?
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:15.520]   I think, generally speaking, I have in favor of any companies move to more
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.760]   encrypted communications and a more private system.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.200]   I think the issues that we've seen with Facebook's move in that direction is that now,
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.560]   it's pretty hard to moderate private groups.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.480]   That's where we see a lot of coronavirus misinformation,
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.160]   voting misinformation and so forth.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:30.320]   And so there's always a minus to every plus.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:32.800]   But I mean, in general, I'm in favor of those things.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.080]   And I think it's the right way for them to go.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:34.320]   It is.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.400]   But of course, they're balancing that with an advertising platform that is dependent
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.800]   on knowing thoughts about you both on and off site.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.640]   So Facebook's never going to be really private.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.480]   They're going to do a patina of privacy on top of an ad machine.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.880]   And you can't forget it, if you use any one of their apps now,
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.240]   you're in the ecosystem.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.840]   And so it doesn't really matter, right?
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.120]   One account means when you see a Facebook like button on a web page,
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.720]   even if you don't use Facebook, you only use Instagram, you're in it, baby.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:01.600]   Go ahead.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.560]   And what they're talking about, like being able to cross post from Instagram to Facebook to WhatsApp
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.480]   simultaneously, that seems to me like a way that misinformation could spread even faster,
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.200]   theoretically.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:16.800]   But I guess it means they'll get me back on Messenger.
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:20.400]   So are you on Facebook?
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.640]   I am on Facebook.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.640]   I deleted the Messenger app, but I'm also on WhatsApp and Instagram.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.200]   So you don't don't delete anything.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.320]   You're crazy.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.200]   Doesn't matter.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:31.920]   Use it all.
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.400]   If I'm not on Facebook, and I'm not on any of them,
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.320]   but if I installed Messenger, it would open the floodgates.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.360]   Everything would come back.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.400]   It'd be over for you.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:42.960]   It'd be over.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.080]   The thing is Facebook Messenger has the best stickers.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.440]   Signal does not have good stickers.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.040]   WhatsApp has some of the Facebook Messenger stickers, but not all of them.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.560]   Messenger is where the good stickers are.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:54.960]   And it hurts me.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.160]   And good filters.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.680]   And good, all that stuff is good on Messenger, isn't it?
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.040]   That they are.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:01.920]   I'm so...
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:02.720]   OK.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:04.000]   I'm a little bunnier-rapping, but...
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:10.320]   When you look on your phone, if you download the Facebook app and the Messenger app,
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.440]   that's a gig of data that you've just stuck onto your phone.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.520]   And I don't trust it.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.800]   I don't have an Instagram account.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.840]   I don't use WhatsApp.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.320]   I don't...
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.240]   You know, it's just why the hell given that information?
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.800]   I will quite happily use Facebook on the browser.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.560]   I can't answer messages within an hour or so.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.080]   I have to wait till I get home and get my desktop machine opened.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.400]   But why the hell given the data?
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.880]   They've shown themselves to be absolutely unreliable with dealing with it.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.960]   So just deny it to them.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.000]   Yes.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:42.560]   I don't want to do that.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.120]   I am on Instagram, but don't be on it.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.240]   Don't be like me.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:52.400]   And people are saying that, "Sharon, Leo, you just said you gave everything to Google,
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.920]   so you might as well give it to Facebook."
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.160]   No!
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.480]   I think Zuckerberg's Satan.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.720]   Well, you're making the exact argument that the opposite of what you were saying earlier.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.480]   Well, I'm going to give my data to a nice guy like Senator Pichai,
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.960]   but doesn't mean I should give it to Satan.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.320]   Well...
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:16.640]   I mean, you're supporting Amazon, but you're supporting Facebook.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:19.120]   I think we all end up failing the ethical consumer test.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.680]   I think earlier, or more wrong, rather than critical.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.560]   It was hypocritical.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:23.120]   Oh!
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:23.120]   Oh!
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:23.680]   Oh!
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:24.480]   No, no.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.040]   No, no.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.400]   No, I was just about to say, I felt so bad for you,
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.800]   fanning yourself that you could turn on your fan.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:33.520]   No, don't let me do that.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.960]   No, you're starting to glow.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.240]   You need to turn on your fan.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:36.880]   You poor woman.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.400]   No, I'm just saying.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.000]   Your fan is fantastic.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.520]   But, I mean, honestly, when it comes to this stuff,
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.680]   if you look at, there's a very good Twitter feed,
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:49.600]   which looks at the top 10 articles shared on Facebook,
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.200]   and it's horrifying.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:51.600]   Oh!
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:52.880]   I mean, it's scary.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.080]   I agree.
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:58.160]   I pretty much 7 or 8 out of 10 of the top Facebook articles
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:02.800]   for the day are Ben Shapiro, Open News Network, Fox News,
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.200]   or the rest of it.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.040]   Shapiro's huge on Facebook.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.640]   That guy is really Satan.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.920]   I don't think Zuckerberg's Satan.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.880]   I think he's just kind of chaotic neutral.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.880]   No, I think with Shapiro,
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.400]   it's got to have been tough growing up as the smartest kid
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.640]   in your high school and being that short,
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.040]   and he's got a massive chip on his shoulder.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.280]   And, you know, I get it.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.120]   He plays the giddy go argument.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.280]   He will throw out 10 statements,
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.520]   eight of which are wrong, two of which are right.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.360]   And if you try and take him up on that,
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.840]   then it's a very common debating technique.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.240]   But I find him terribly hard work.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.400]   And, you know, it's--
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.920]   You've actually given him more time than I would ever give him.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:44.560]   I'm impressed.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.280]   Well, Facebook is turning into Fox News.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.480]   You know, it's the kind of thing that your parents get into.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.720]   And I love my in-laws dearly,
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.440]   but if they do one more survey
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:58.240]   that gives them my personal information on Facebook
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:00.880]   about which Star Trek Captain are you,
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.880]   or, you know, what kind of cat are you,
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.600]   it just drives you nuts.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.760]   Here's from the Facebook Top 10
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.920]   Twitter account for October 2nd,
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.480]   the top performing link posts.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.240]   When they start top performing,
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.240]   they mean that got the most engagement,
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.560]   the most retweeting kind of thing.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.360]   This isn't the last 24 hours.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.480]   Fox News, the Duck Commander.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:24.880]   Wow.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.840]   You know who he is, right?
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.400]   Still going.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.440]   I can't believe he's around.
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.720]   You go with a big bed?
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.680]   WAB Channel 9, Robert Reich.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:32.880]   So that's left.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.000]   That's leftist.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.160]   My modern met Robert Reich again.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.200]   I don't know how he got on there twice.
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.000]   Fox News again.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.520]   I don't know how he got in size.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:44.400]   Dan Bongino, Bonino, Bonino, Mark Levin and Tasty.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.280]   That seems pretty ecumenical.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.120]   I think Robert Reich,
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.880]   getting too in there about coronavirus,
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.840]   does not undercut the fact that usually that list
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:56.800]   is like two-bench periling a Reverend Franklin Graham link,
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.760]   three Fox News links,
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:58.960]   let me from OA and N.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:00.080]   It's usually built.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.840]   And I think the point here is that Facebook is garbage,
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.440]   but you can't now just avoid it
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:04.880]   because if you have an Instagram account,
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:05.680]   if you have a WhatsApp account,
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.840]   you're now part of the broader empire.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.720]   And so back in the day,
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.760]   I think it would have been much more easy
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.680]   to kind of like opt into a little bit of Suck.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:12.640]   You know, just a little bit.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.960]   Sussan of Suck, if you will, whatever you've been saying.
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:16.720]   Suck.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.120]   Yes.
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:19.200]   I want the Suck a move.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.600]   That sounds like sweaty.
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.520]   At the moment I said it, I'm like, that was a mistake.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.400]   I should not have said that.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.800]   No, it was the best thing I've heard all day.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.960]   And it should be an episode title of something.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:31.440]   It is.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.840]   We just made it that I'm editing this.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:37.120]   I'm taking weirdos and wankers out.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.480]   And it's now a soup song of Suck,
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:42.320]   but I'm going to have to teach the editors how to do a CD,
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.240]   a CD on the C there.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.760]   I don't know how we're going to do that,
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.720]   but we'll figure it out.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.760]   And you just sort of want the secret spreadsheet
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.200]   that we all used to plan to show.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.240]   So, sorry.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.280]   Oh, sorry.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:53.760]   Yeah, I did.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:54.480]   I showed it.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.440]   I showed it.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.640]   We have no secrets here.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:59.280]   Our Communist masters will punish you for this.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.360]   It's like on Google sheets.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:05.120]   Oh, hey, Boris, do we have access to Google sheets?
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.200]   Oh, yes, of course Natasha.
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.960]   We can get in there anytime.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.880]   So what?
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.440]   So what?
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.720]   I'm trying to remember the name of the Bond villain
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.600]   where they had the Russian.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.240]   They had a really bad Bond girl.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.440]   Lottie Lenny with a knife in her shoe.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.880]   It was.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.400]   It was from Russia with love.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.600]   Oh, she was great.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.600]   Oh, man.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.880]   I have.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.760]   I still have dreams about Lottie Lenny with a knife in her shoe.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.760]   The kind of stuff.
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:38.320]   Dangerous ground.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:38.800]   All the sudden.
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.600]   Okay.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.360]   Moving off the roof.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:41.840]   Anyone.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.840]   [laughter]
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.280]   Oh, that's great.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:45.680]   That's great.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.560]   He's going with this idea.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:46.720]   All right.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.040]   Okay.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:47.760]   Hey, TikTok.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.320]   So last week, last week,
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.960]   we were sitting here during the show.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.400]   I tried to make the show as long as possible
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.920]   because we were waiting for the judge
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.320]   to rule on whether he was going to save TikTok or not.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.840]   The minute I end the show, he rules.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.800]   And he says, "You can't block TikTok.
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.760]   What are you nuts?"
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.200]   Well, he didn't say exactly like that,
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.640]   but TikTok got a reprieve.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.400]   Now, I think the president has other fish to fry.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:11.280]   I bet you it's over.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.640]   But aren't they actually getting banned on November 12th anyway,
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.280]   regardless of-
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.280]   No, the judge said no.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:20.880]   Nope.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:23.840]   I thought it was the ban from that weekend that would have been
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:27.200]   stayed, but they were still being made dysfunctional on the 12th.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:27.840]   I might be wrong.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:28.880]   Ah, ah.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:29.360]   Ah.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.080]   That's the problem.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.400]   Well, it is a temporary ban in the sense that there has to be a trial, I think.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:34.880]   Oh, no.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.440]   You're right.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.160]   You nailed it.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.880]   The app is still scheduled to become non-functional,
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.800]   but this must be through some sort of
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.800]   other hijinks.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:46.000]   This whole thing is a marriage show, if you will.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.520]   It is a marriage show.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:48.960]   It's a soup song of "Mared."
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:54.240]   Judge Nichols apparently did not quote at this time,
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.440]   block additional restrictions by the Department of Commerce
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.480]   that would be set to take effect November 12th.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:01.680]   I presume those are the-
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.800]   the easiest thing for the government to do is just say,
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.760]   "You can't have any financial transactions with Americans,"
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.360]   which would immediately shut them down
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:11.040]   because they can't pay for their AWS.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.160]   They can't pay for anything.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.840]   It was-
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.680]   Surely you mean their Oracle Cloud Bill?
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:20.080]   Damn, they moved over to Oracle yet?
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:20.640]   I don't know.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.440]   It's part of the deal.
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.000]   So the issue with the TikTok story, as far as I can tell,
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.400]   if you read through the TikTok of the TikTok story,
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.320]   it's that there's so many little twists and turns
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.120]   in what's going to happen.
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.160]   But as far as we can tell it,
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:31.520]   and I'll take a shot at some reason this,
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.360]   Oracle's going to buy a chunk of a kind of globalized entity
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:37.120]   that will hold TikTok.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:39.760]   TikTok's code will become available for Oracle to look through.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:44.080]   Oracle will host TikTok stealing a Google customer away
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:47.040]   because Trump likes Oracle because he's also evil,
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.840]   and he doesn't like Google because it's relatively neutral.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:51.760]   And nothing will change, effectively,
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.600]   other than a Trump-Sico fan, Larry Ellison will get some free money.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.040]   It's really just a disappointing end to a theoretically interesting moment
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.880]   in kind of global politics in the tech world,
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:03.360]   but instead it's going to be a Trump-Chrony payoff.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.000]   You know who's going to be really this point?
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.520]   Stevie Nicks.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:11.760]   So Fleetwood Mac, 1977.
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:14.880]   I was, this is the year I would have graduated from college
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.720]   and I'd not been sidelined by radio.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.920]   Fleetwood Mac released "Rumors," one of the best-selling albums of all times,
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.440]   featuring a song by Stevie Nicks called "Dreams."
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:27.920]   Remember that?
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.920]   I can't play it because YouTube will take us down.
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:41.280]   But Dogface 208, I'm sorry, 420 Dogface 208 on TikTok apparently has no such scruples.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.720]   Here's the guy now.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.760]   Don't play my sound because I don't want to be taken down.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:52.800]   He is longboarding down the highway with a big bottle, a big bottle of cranberry juice.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:55.200]   That looks good.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:58.560]   And lip-syncing to Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams."
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:03.280]   This is, by the way, Lizzie, you have a feather tattoo on the side of his head.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:03.680]   Okay.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:06.480]   This guy is the only guy who's doing 2020 right.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:12.800]   So Dogface 208, somehow unaccountably.
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:16.000]   I don't know why because that wasn't the most exciting TikTok I've ever seen.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.840]   What is that on this?
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.600]   What tattoo is that on his head?
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.400]   Yeah, it's feathers.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.360]   Okay.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:22.800]   Leo, can I help a little bit with this?
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:23.200]   That's cool.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.440]   So it became a hit.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.160]   Yes, please.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.160]   So he's done other stuff.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:30.720]   So one of the things that I've learned about TikToks on my friend,
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.120]   Sydney, because they're cool and I'm not, is that you'll often be sent a TikTok from someone
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.720]   about which people already know.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:39.760]   So there's kind of an in-joke or a meta-themed to it.
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:43.920]   And so this guy, if I'm having my TikTok or script, has a library of stuff that he's done.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.720]   So we're seeing--
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:46.720]   So yes, millions of followers.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:49.040]   Millions of followers, probably.
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:56.240]   But for whatever reason, all of a sudden, "Dreams," this, what is it?
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:01.360]   43-year-old song by Fleetwood Mac is soaring to the top of the charts.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:06.640]   Number 39 is in the top 40 on Rolling Stones charts of streaming songs.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.720]   Suddenly, people everywhere are downloading it.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.520]   I'm just imagining myself, a bunch of 12-year-olds who'd never heard this song in their life going,
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.800]   "Oh, I like the bass line."
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:16.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.960]   And playing on Spotify.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:21.600]   This is the power of TikTok.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:26.080]   I mean, okay, Farrah, first off, Fleetwood Mac did some damn good tunes.
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:27.360]   And suddenly you--
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:28.800]   Oh, it's a great song!
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.320]   If you never heard it, I don't blame you.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.360]   You should listen to it.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.520]   You never want to be in a car with me when Chain is playing because--
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.320]   [GROANING]
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.760]   It's foot to the floor, round the corner.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.720]   You know, this is the ultimate Formula One track.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.920]   And my wife would nearly kill me if she's in the car.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:46.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.000]   And I was driving on that.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:55.520]   But it's fascinating how this has worked out because it seemed as though TikTok was being banned
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.360]   for completely arbitrary reasons.
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.720]   And then you're like, well, Zuckerberg's close to Trump.
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.720]   Maybe he wants to get rid of the competition because basically, you know,
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:07.040]   they bought Instagram, they bought WhatsApp.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:13.120]   They're taking the Cisco route of buying the competition or subverting them in some ways.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.960]   TikTok isn't taking any more data than Facebook is.
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:21.840]   But the difference is it's our data rather than Chinese data.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.920]   And the Oracle deal doesn't seem to do anything.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.280]   It's all-- Of course not.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.320]   Oracle is-- Oracle is--
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:26.520]   It's--
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:26.520]   It's--
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:26.520]   It's--
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:26.520]   It's--
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:26.520]   It's--
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.020]   It's--
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:27.520]   It's--
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:27.520]   It's--
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:27.520]   It's--
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:31.920]   And I'm telling you, the president has completely lost interest.
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.840]   He's completely forgotten about it.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.640]   The Commerce Department isn't going to do it.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.440]   It's over.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:38.080]   It's over.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:44.240]   Meanwhile, Nathan Apodaca, aka 420 Dogface 208, I am--
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:50.320]   I can't play the music, but I'm going to do my best Stevie Nicks as he sings.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.160]   Well--
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.360]   They're still going to take you down, man.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.360]   Well--
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.960]   Well, here you go again.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:58.960]   You got my free--
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.560]   That's not good.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:06.000]   The thing that's bizarre to me about this is that this whole saga has gone so off the rails
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.760]   that at this point, I think, a Trump corony getting a bunch of money
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:12.880]   is the best case scenario for me because the other scenario is
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:17.360]   the complete splintering of the internet,
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.920]   which means the complete splintering of our reality.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.400]   That's right.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:22.880]   No, you don't want a Chinese internet, a US internet,
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:23.760]   a UK internet.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.560]   You don't want that.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:27.920]   That's the whole point of the internet is everything flows freely.
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:33.120]   And I feel like if TikTok were banned here or was forced to break off,
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.360]   I mean, China already does have its own internet,
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.520]   I think it would be completely reasonable for European countries
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:42.960]   to look at our American-owned social media and be like,
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.360]   "Huh, now wait a minute.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.720]   These platforms actually, like Facebook actually
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.000]   was shown to be used by meddling foreign agents in our last election.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.080]   Maybe we should do something about those and
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.320]   someone should do something about those."
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:58.320]   Yes.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.440]   But it does contribute to the complete splintering of
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:04.160]   the main way that we communicate now, which scares me a lot.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:06.160]   So that's a really good point, Simone.
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.160]   But I think that the thing that we'd lost,
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.080]   that we could have really had the moment about is algorithms and how they work.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:13.920]   Like, for example, people said that TikTok,
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:15.440]   because it's algorithm was in China,
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:17.520]   could be used to influence voters in America.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.560]   True.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:19.520]   Now, it wasn't happening.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.240]   I don't think so.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.600]   But it could happen.
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.280]   But one thing we should do is turn that lens around to its stuff from home.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.440]   We don't know how the news feed works.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:28.400]   We probably should.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:32.240]   There probably should be more clarity around how these major social algorithms work,
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:36.960]   so we can better understand how we're being manipulated as a strong or but influenced,
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.920]   say, by these major companies.
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:40.640]   Did you watch the Netflix social dilemma?
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.600]   Has anybody watched that?
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:42.960]   I didn't add to it.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:44.560]   Some moms doesn't show, but I haven't.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.120]   No, don't.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.000]   Your mom's wrong.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:46.960]   I tried to watch it.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.800]   It's awful.
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.560]   It's plumply propaganda.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:57.200]   You know, obviously, I'm not a Facebook fan, but it's completely slanted.
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:57.920]   It's one of those.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:02.240]   They have these fake montages of like a family who, and you know,
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:07.520]   the kid is just, I can't raise his eyes away from the phone because he's always on Facebook.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:11.520]   It's just be, it's, it's reefer madness for the 21st century.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.520]   Do you remember that movie?
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.640]   Do you any of you older than that?
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.440]   Oh, yes.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.640]   No, it's hilarious.
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:17.200]   But I'm.
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:21.360]   It's an anti-marawana movie from the 40s, I think,
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:25.120]   and all the horrible things that will happen to you if you smoke the happy weed.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:25.760]   This is that.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.360]   This is that.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:28.880]   This is, you know.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:32.720]   No, it's the devil's cabbage for a new generation.
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.320]   For a new generation.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:42.960]   But I mean, I do worry that, you know, the people's interactions online are being so directed.
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:48.160]   And yeah, okay, from an algorithmic perspective, it makes, it makes great sense.
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:50.480]   People like this, therefore we should promote this.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:57.600]   But if you think back to, okay, I'm being an old fot here, but I mean, when I grew up in the
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:04.880]   UK in the 1970s, we had three television channels about eight national newspapers and about four
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:10.960]   radio channels. And now I do work, you know, and compared to 100 years ago, where you just had a
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:15.920]   few newspapers and that was it. The amount of information that people are having to deal with
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:22.240]   right now is really, really disturbing. When you look at psychologically how people deal with this,
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:29.280]   they just basically turn it off and you go with tribal bases. So we're facing a very interesting
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:35.440]   sort of crux point of civilization in terms of how we deal with information overload.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.280]   And we haven't had to deal with this before.
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:42.000]   It's going to be very interesting and possibly very horrifying in terms of how we deal with it.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.960]   Well, we're not. I mean, like, look at Q and A, we're not.
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:51.680]   Sorry, I was going to say, I think Trump being diagnosed with COVID is a perfect example of that
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.240]   happening. Because even I found myself just kind of compulsively checking the news, even though I
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:00.960]   know like it's been an hour, nothing's happened in the last hour. I don't need to be constantly
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:06.000]   checking. But the fact that I can, I think just encourages bad habits.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.840]   And it's when you say the news, you mean Twitter.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:11.200]   Actually, I mean, NPR.org.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:13.200]   Oh, don't lie.
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:15.520]   Free.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.080]   NPL represent.
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:18.720]   Definitely.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:25.280]   Oh, all right. If you say so, I, you know, it's funny. I wake up in the morning. First thing
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:30.720]   in the morning, check Twitter. Who else is sick? So we're going to take a little break,
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:34.960]   come back with the final segment. But I do want to play. We had a, we had a wonderful week. Can
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:40.240]   you turn my audio on? We had a wonderful week this week on Twitter on Twitter. I'm not, we're not
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:46.880]   Twitter. But we had a wonderful week. And I have a little movie that shows a little bit of what
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:54.880]   happened this week on, on Twitch.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:54:11.200]   Smoke Mary. Hey. Are you sure Jimmy? I'll be back soon. You're already
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:20.640]   minute. You know what they're smoking. Those aren't cigarettes and Mary is about to get wild.
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:26.960]   I mean, that was a real hit. That's a fair hit.
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.320]   Here it comes. The crazy Mary Jane dreams.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:41.680]   This is the most funny movie. I guess I saw it. I was pretty high when I saw it.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:47.760]   Is this a bad part? This is, this is, this is a boring part.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:53.520]   Do I have to take a part on us? We're always talking to the DA. You mean,
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:56.880]   you're doing clear. We are. Where's the party scene? That's what I want.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:02.960]   You know what, John? I think our memory of this.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:11.520]   Okay, that's not true. That's just my laugh. What are you trying to say, Leon?
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:18.560]   Look, I can't have a fight going on. Yeah? Yeah? I'm on the fight too.
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:30.320]   That's me when we're done with social distancing and I can cut people again. I can touch a person.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:34.800]   I can touch a person. All right. This isn't turning out anything like I'd hoped.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:39.520]   I guess literally I was so high when I saw this first time it seemed more amusing.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:44.400]   Why did they have guns? Because they're marijuana users and he's.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:55.840]   Are they NYPD? I mean, what was he going to stick around and what's he doing?
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:00.480]   Go ahead, you guys. Get those people in the patty wagon. I'm going to see if there's any joints left.
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.520]   I was behind you. No, no, no. Go hang up.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:20.480]   There's an amazing film where they actually they take an acid user and she's just like,
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:26.480]   do I boil the baby or something? It's just gone. All right. We're going to actually show an actual
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:31.280]   promo. That was reefer madness. This is what happened to the longs on a coin.
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:39.600]   Yeah. Oh, you do belong in a coin. Regal. I want a Jeff Jarvis quarter.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:48.160]   Previously on Twit. Hands on Android. I have a phone that folds. That's right. It's the Samsung
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:52.800]   Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. I've got some tips and tricks coming at you next.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:59.440]   Twit events. We thought it'd be kind of interesting to get some of the smartest people I know together
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:05.760]   to talk about how business is going to change when the world gets back to normal. I think the
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:12.560]   COVID aftershocks will be with us for many, many years into the future and it doesn't all have to
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:18.320]   be bad. Tech News weekly. Why did Google decide that the unlocked version of Pixel 5 in America
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:22.240]   needs millimeter wave when every other country on earth where the Pixel 5 will be sold?
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.720]   No models will have millimeter wave. And the answer we're getting so far is basically
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:31.280]   Google felt pressured by carriers. And that just me is just so backward and it's already
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:39.600]   resulted in price disparities. Security now. What could possibly go wrong? We have Amazon
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:48.080]   rings announcement of their autonomous home security flying webcam. No one designed to test
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:54.720]   these things has a dog or cat. They would dive under the bed and never be seen again.
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:58:09.440]   Twit. Oh, what a week it was. I'm sorry. I grew up with cats and labortals. That flying drone is
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:17.040]   toast. The second. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Lisa wants to buy one at 250 bucks just so we can
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:23.040]   give it to the cats to eat. We're going to dress it up like a bird. It's going to be so much fun.
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:28.800]   Oh my God. Our show today brought to you by Barracuda. Every time I do these ads, I want to,
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:32.320]   I want that heart. Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:38.800]   Barracuda. Actually, Barracuda is really well known as the provider of cloud enabled
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:46.000]   enterprise grade security solutions for every part of your network email, data, applications,
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.320]   and of course the network itself. Now, I want to tell you a little bit about Barracuda's total
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:59.040]   email protection because we know 91% of all cyber attacks start with an email. I don't know if you
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:04.880]   read that great article. I think it was in the Atlantic about the North Hydro ransomware exploit.
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:09.680]   This happened last year. Wasn't that well written? This is one of the biggest aluminum makers in
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:15.520]   the world. How did this entire company get shut down? It cost them $60 million. They get
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:22.320]   shut down because of an email. An Italian customer sent an email to a North Hydro employee with an
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:28.800]   innocent attachment except it was intercepted and a malicious attachment was substituted.
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:35.280]   And that's all it took for the bad guys to take down that entire company, $60 million in losses.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:41.600]   Now, put yourself in that position. You've got employees working remotely dozens, hundreds,
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:48.480]   maybe even thousands, each of one of them is getting tons of email every day. And all it takes is one
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:55.840]   click on the wrong email and spearfishing ransomware account takeover conversation hijacking.
[01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:01.280]   It could cost you money. It could cost you customers. It cost you reputation. You've got to protect
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:06.240]   yourself against email threats. And that's what Barracuda is an expert. They've noticed, by the
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:14.080]   way, since this all started a spike of 667% in COVID related spearfishing attacks.
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:21.920]   That's a huge jump. They impersonate the World Health Organization, or worse, maybe they impersonate
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:28.400]   your HR manager or the boss. And they and they purport to have emails with important information.
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:34.880]   Open this PDF up. We want to protect you. Here's our policy. And you open it and the whole thing
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:41.200]   is shot. You need the protection Barracuda total email protection can offer. It includes all in
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:47.040]   one email security, backup and archiving. That may be a legal requirement, depending on your business,
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:52.640]   AI-based protection. And you want an AI base because the threats are constantly shifting
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:58.080]   from spearfishing account takeover, business email, compromise, you need protection that says
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:04.560]   nimble and changes as rapidly as the bad guys are. It gives you an automated incident response
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:08.960]   that is really important. It gives you the options to very quickly and efficiently address the
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:15.760]   attacks. We know the faster you react, the less damage there will be. And they even offer security
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:19.920]   awareness training for your workforce, because after all, aren't your employees the first line

[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:11.760]   Treasury is speaking of ransomware. Treasury Department is now warning people. This is
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:20.400]   advisory from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If you pay ransomware to cyber actors,
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:27.440]   you will be violating over FAC regulations and you could be prosecuted.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:36.800]   So not only are you hit by ransomware, your company's down, but if you dare to pay the
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:41.600]   ransom, which is, of course, everybody agrees a bad idea, but we know it happens often.
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:48.880]   Yeah. You could go to jail. What? Do they have another solution for helping people get their
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:57.040]   stuff back? Or is that just like, no, no? I don't know. I mean, this whole thing really worried me
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:02.720]   because, okay, first off, I mean, the Treasury statement was an advisory. They said it wasn't
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:09.360]   done by the rule of law, but that day is coming. But I mean, at the end of the day, we shouldn't be
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:14.880]   paying criminals to get our data back. You should be investing instead in proper data backups and
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:21.120]   restore facilities so that you can say to these people, get lost, we can have this back up in 24
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:27.360]   hours. It has been done before. It can be done again. Put the initial investment in there,
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:32.240]   and you can tell the criminals to go swivel. It's getting harder, and I'll tell you why.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.720]   And I know it's harder because companies like North Skydrow, who should be prepared for such a
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:43.120]   thing, in fact, they had a plan, still were unable to stop it and fix it. And here's a couple of
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:48.320]   reasons. First of all, these ransomware guys are getting very sophisticated, and they're now
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:53.520]   targeted attacks. This isn't an email that's sent to a million people across the country looking for
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:59.040]   100 Bitcoin. These are, they're going after your company. So they're very sophisticated,
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:03.600]   spearfishing attacks. The other thing is they don't trigger the ransomware right away. And I
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:08.560]   think this is one of the reasons it's a big threat. What we're seeing is they will wander around your
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:14.480]   network for months, sussing out all your, for instance, backup strategies, all your offline
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:20.160]   backups, infecting whichever of those they can infect, and doing something, and this is the new
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:26.720]   thing, exfiltrating data. So Canon, this happened to Canon, remember, Canon got encrypted, lost a
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:32.400]   lot of data. They didn't pay the ransomware. So the second arm of this attack was to release
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.720]   information about Canon customers to the public net. So it's blackmail on two fronts. You ever
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:43.760]   want to see your data again, pay us. Oh, and by the way, we have your, we have all of the information
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:48.080]   about your customers. And if you don't pay us, we're going to release that. So it's a lot. I,
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.360]   it's hard. I don't, I, I'm terrified. I'm terrified.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:59.040]   I got to say the big, the one that really scared me most was the MERSC hit,
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:05.680]   you know, second largest container carrying organization in the world. They were down to
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:13.200]   paper after getting hit by a ransomware attack. You know, this was a, a serious economic hit. And
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.800]   we can't just keep paying these people off. We need to build systems which can, you know,
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:23.520]   bounce them off like a renoff or a screen door. You know, I mean, it's just a question of
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:29.200]   getting the infrastructure in there and the backup systems in there. And I get, they're getting
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:34.480]   smarter. They are going to go in and try and, you know, deal with all this stuff. We've dealt
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:39.120]   with this with viruses. We've dealt with this in other areas. This has to be dealt with because
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:44.160]   otherwise we're just paying criminals. Well, worse than that, people are dying. So a German
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:50.240]   hospital reported that after a ransomware attack, a patient died because of lack of care.
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:55.120]   This week, the universal health services was attacked. This is one of the largest health care
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:06:01.680]   operations in the world. They care for 3.5 million patients every year, 400 facilities in the U.S.
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:06.880]   in the UK. They were down just as the same thing. They were down to using paper. Their
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:09.920]   x-ray machines were offline. They couldn't use them. Oh my God.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:16.080]   They had to, and this is the, this is the sad part of it. They had to redirect ambulances to
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:22.320]   other hospitals. They reported that four patients died because of that redirection. So this is
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:29.280]   now costing lives. This is now very, very serious. I completely agree with you, Ian. I just
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:35.840]   think it's almost impossible to stop. Yeah, I think I completely agree with Ian, but I also think
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:40.880]   it becomes an arm race just like it is with any other hack where they're going to keep getting
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:45.280]   better. White hats are going to keep building stronger systems, but they're going to kind of
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:53.040]   move in tandem. And by the way, what kind of, speaking of Satan, what kind of evil person
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:58.000]   attacks a hospital network during a pandemic? Oh, a monster. That is a monster. That is somebody
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:05.040]   who values Bitcoin more than human life. Well, I'm, I, I could say I'm sorry. This is the way that
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:11.440]   the criminals operate. There's a thing in the UK where if somebody had a disabled handrail
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:15.920]   installed outside their flat, they get robbed because people knew they were disabled.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:22.160]   Criminals have, they're scum this way. And I'm sorry, you need to fight them direct.
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:29.520]   And what worries me about the ransomware thing is insurance companies are encouraging companies
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:35.680]   to pay off the ransomware because it's a cheaper solution than actually rebuilding from scratch.
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:41.760]   So you're encouraging crime by the insurance industry. So I think honestly, it's time for
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:47.680]   me to say if you are legally liable, if you don't have the ability to recover from this stuff,
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:54.000]   because this is just going to grow and grow and grow. Otherwise, we need to cut this off right now.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.560]   Yeah, I think the thing is stronger. Nothing wrong with making it harder for them.
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:04.240]   I think make it harder for the criminals to get in, but also stiffer civil penalties. Like
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:08.320]   when the Equifax hack happened, I thought the company should be put out of business.
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:13.600]   They irrigated themselves the right to cut all of my information, which I didn't really like to be
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:18.000]   clear. And then they lost it all in a very embarrassing manner. And they were given a slap on the wrist.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:24.000]   No, that should be a shut down offense. And I think if we had that level of civil penalty
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.520]   in place for companies that are bad at cybersecurity, get to man the right to have lots of our data,
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:32.880]   then we would see a real reform. Then we would see more money going into cybersecurity,
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:36.400]   more into offense and defense. But we just don't see it because they know that they could hack.
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:41.440]   What are the people going to do about it? Maybe those are customers. It's not the end of the world.
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:48.000]   That's damn right. Equifax actually made a profit out of that hack, because they put third party
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:54.800]   security checking services, which they happen to own. As part of the deal, their share price went
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:09:01.920]   up after they did a deal with the DOJ. There is no penalty on this. So you should really penalise
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:05.280]   companies for bad security, but it ain't happening at the moment.
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:14.000]   I don't want to get political. But meanwhile, H1B visas have been basically cut off by the White
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:19.920]   House. New restrictive rules greatly reduce the number of foreign workers. This was opposed by
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:25.840]   Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Intel, PayPal and Twitter among dozens of others because these tech
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:31.920]   giants often bring in highly trained security personnel and others. These are the highest
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:39.520]   skills in many cases, tech workers. So in a way, you're saying, and by the way, let's not any of
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:45.520]   those people from foreign countries come in and help us with this problem. There is a workforce
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:50.640]   grant program. They're going to give up to 30 grants to train US citizens for middle to high
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:57.200]   skilled H1B occupations, which is a great idea. $150 million is going to be allocated to this.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:03.280]   It's going to be years before they can replace these workers that we're losing. And it's honestly
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:09.840]   it's an anti-immigrant thing. These H1B visas have been around for a long time. They're not taking
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:14.880]   jobs. And you know what? If you think they are, then great, give these grants, get these people,
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:22.560]   get Americans trained to take the jobs, but don't yet cut off the H1B visa because it may be that
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:28.160]   that's exactly the wrong thing to do with this time. I mean, I've got to say I was with Trump on
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:34.960]   the H1B thing. And this is not a thing I would say in pretty much any other area policy. But
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:46.800]   if you look at the H1B applications from 2010 to about 2015, 80% of those weren't for the really high
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:53.360]   class computer technicians. They were for basic admin skills. And they were being used by outsourcing
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:11:00.880]   firms to basically get people in. And that was fundamentally wrong. But at the current situation,
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:08.960]   we've got to, no one is wanting, they've had to redo the H1B auction a second time because no one
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.760]   wants to come to America. It's over. Yeah. Yeah. And even if you didn't cut it off, nobody's
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:20.640]   applying. I wonder why. Well, I mean, the problem is tech firms use this to keep salaries low.
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:25.840]   Because if you've got an H1B worker who knows that if you fire him, he's got to get him and his
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:31.520]   family out of the country in 30 days. That's a very big incentive to abuse workers.
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:40.080]   Now, I'm all full getting the best talent into the US using the H1B system. But it was abused for
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:47.360]   many years. This isn't a solution though. No. Yeah. I have friends there on H1B visas who are in
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:53.040]   the upper echelon tech jobs working for a big four American tech companies paying loads of American
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:58.320]   taxes and not suffering from what you're accurately describing. So if we could find a way to cleave
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:02.880]   off the abuse, I being favorable. But fundamentally, I'm going to be more opposed to anti-immigrant
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:06.640]   policies that I'm going to be worried about wage issues inside of tech. Yeah. Can I pick
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:11.200]   up poison? I suppose there's no perfect way out of it. I don't think again. That's far enough.
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:17.440]   If you're in Ireland, you should know that the bread that Subway uses to make their sandwich
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:22.800]   actually, Oh God, this is terrible. It's not legally the same. It's bread. I think this is
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:26.640]   pretty funny. The Irish court said there's too much sugar in it.
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:34.000]   Oh, wow. Okay. It is cake. It's not bread. So it can't be categorized as a staple food.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.440]   Staple foods in Ireland are not taxed. Subway bread is in fact taxed because it has a sugar
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:45.440]   content of 10% of the weight of the flour in the dough, highly exceeding the 2%.
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.840]   What are they doing with that bread? Why is it so tasty though? You know,
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:54.880]   I'm willing to bet that McDonald's hamburgers have their fair share of sugar in the mess.
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:01.120]   Oh, yeah. I mean, I said, Brit, this has been something which I mean, okay, bread, it's
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.560]   you daily staple. But it's just horrifying. You're mad at sugar. You put into bread.
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.360]   It's cake. You're right. I mean, there is a bread in our local supermarket
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.880]   that has a bread that advertises only one gram of sugar per slice. Seriously?
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:28.000]   Yeah. Now I make my own bread. I put a maximum a teaspoon of honey in there.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.440]   But the amount of sugar in American bread is horrifying. I buy diabrettic slice low simply
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:40.160]   to avoid it and make my own now. When I make my bread, it's got flour, water, salt, and starter.
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:45.280]   I don't put sugar in it. Do you know how hard it is to buy delicious about sugar?
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:48.160]   Yeah. Oh, yeah. Everything in America has so much sugar in it.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:52.480]   Like just trying to find things that I've no added sugar is like a grocery store sleuthing
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:57.120]   experiment. And I've been trying to see my abs. So I've been working on cutting out sugar
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:02.960]   in my diet. Sugar is poison. Yeah, but it's a cheap additive. It's preservative. And it really adds
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:09.600]   to the mouth feel of every delicious treat. Well, yeah, but at the same time,
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:14.640]   it's just runously unhealthy. I mean, you know, it's a waste line.
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:19.360]   It won't waste line has gone through the roof. But the the amount of sugar and pretty much
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:25.440]   everything over here is terrible. So you would be pro something like this happening in the US.
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:29.200]   Yes. Yes. As an Ireland subway. Take the sugar out.
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:36.000]   Well, the scary thing about subway is their chicken is they sued Canadian broadcast company
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:43.360]   journalists who analyzed their chicken and found that it was 42.8, I think, percent chicken. It was
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:50.800]   rest is corn. I guarantee you. I guarantee you. The rest is emulsifier.
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:58.640]   And they actually sued these journalists and lost. You know, the idea is you could put out chicken
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:05.520]   that is less than 50% actual meat. You'd sue against them and lose. Yeah, you've lost the argument.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:09.600]   I've eaten subway once I came over here and never again.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:15.440]   If you ever learned something like this about the Popeyes chicken sandwich, I need you to not
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:20.480]   tell. Have you done saying that you had one? I've never had one. Are they good? I love Popeyes.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.440]   I had several in there. Great. Yeah, but this isn't just any Popeyes, Alex.
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:31.520]   This is their chicken sandwich. Their new chicken sandwich. I mean, that's this is a special, special,
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:38.320]   special thing. I'm sorry. All Popeyes is good. It's just all Popeyes. Popeyes. I'm going to pull
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:44.320]   over 100%. Really? I have never been to a Popeyes. It's so good. I got onto them in New Orleans.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:50.640]   And now whenever I see one, I'm like, we got to go now. You're talking their buttermilk
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:56.480]   fried chicken sandwich, right? You're not talking just any. You're talking a crispy.
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:03.760]   I tried it. And it's just like, I couldn't work out what the fuss was about. It's like,
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:07.200]   it's a bog standard fried chicken sandwich. That's because you're pretty.
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:11.920]   Look, this is from a guy who thinks a bacon buddy is edible.
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:18.400]   No, a bacon buddy is the food of the gods. I will stand the dial. I rest my kids.
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:23.200]   Just because you like Nando's, like any other chicken, doesn't you need to crap all over it.
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:28.160]   Really important, homegrown American specialties like Popeyes. Yeah, we don't have choices in.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:33.120]   We have to make do with what we've got. Essentially, though, I worked in a Kentucky fried chicken
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:38.080]   when I was a student. And I can never eat it again. Because I know what goes on behind the,
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:42.960]   but you know, buying things. I am tempted by a chicken fillet though. I've never had one.
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:46.320]   What is the fuss about? I'm not going to check for like, because I don't like,
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:52.160]   they don't like, I don't like, I mean, they've got lousy corporate policies. But is it that good?
[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:55.120]   Because people keep on talking about it. Look, it's not you.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:17:04.720]   Oh, I want want. Okay. The show is over kids. Everybody go home. I'm out of here. I got to go get a
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:10.480]   chicken sandwich. I mean, they were like, breaking out over this. They can't be that good. Why would
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:17.200]   you punch someone over a chicken sandwich? Pop. People, people over a lot. Really, really hungry, man.
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:25.280]   Pop eyes near me. I'm going to find a Popeyes now. Oh, there's one five and a half miles away.
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:31.600]   I'm on my way. Popeyes, Louisiana. Come on, Leo. Popeyes doesn't sponsor the show. No, I wish
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:38.320]   they did. If they did, I would. I mean, Leo, you have an in and out just five miles down the road.
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:42.080]   Go and get a double double with monster sauce. That's pretty good, too.
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:49.760]   Okay, Simone, which would you prefer? Which would you rather? A double double with monster
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:57.280]   sauce? Is that what you just said? And yeah, versus a Popeyes, buttermilk, buttermilk,
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:04.480]   chicken sandwich. That's really hard because I do believe that the burger is like a good burger
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:10.160]   is the pinnacle of food. However, I do love that sandwich. I think I'm good with the sandwich.
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:17.120]   I like how correct that was though. She said correctly that burgers are dependable to food
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:21.600]   pyramid. True, but she would go for the sandwich. Correct. That was exactly right. Simone,
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:24.880]   I want to become your friend at some point in time because you've got good taste. We're already
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:34.960]   friends. There we go. I'm so eight o'clock here on the East Coast. I haven't had dinner yet.
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:39.120]   All right, you go. You go. We're going to wrap this up because I got a Popeye. I got a date with
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:47.600]   Popeye. I want to thank Olive Oil for joining us, aka Simone, to her for you kind of look a little
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.800]   bit. I've been told that before so many days. As you said, I have a date with Popeye. I was
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:59.840]   like, people have said that I looked like a lot. You went there. I would gladly pay you Tuesday
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:06.080]   for a Popeyes chicken sandwich today. Simone, you're great. Thank you. Please come back. I
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:10.960]   just love having you on. She is a video producer by day at Polygon.
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:16.880]   Doomquasar on the Twitter. Don't know what that means, but it sounds dangerous.
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:24.560]   However, of course, you must listen to Rocket, her podcast with Brianna and Christina. It's such a
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:32.640]   good show. That's on relay.fm. Anything else you want to plug? I've got a video coming out on
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:37.360]   Polygon's YouTube channel on October 19th on architecture in video games. It's going to be
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:44.720]   very cool. We just had our 300 episode on Rocket. Don't listen to the old ones. It's a news show.
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:48.880]   So the old ones are completely out of date by now, but come back and listen to our show. It's
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:53.200]   very fun. Wait a minute. Game architecture. Do you have a background in architecture?
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:20:00.880]   I don't. I have a layman's interest in architecture, but I talked to Stuart McDonald,
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:05.760]   who did the world design for Control, which came out last year. It takes place in this
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:12.560]   incredible, trippy, brutalist building. It's just basically about all the ways that architecture
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:18.240]   manifests in games and how it can tell us what to do without explicitly saying,
[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:22.720]   "Hey, you have to do this," but you behave a certain way because of the building that you're in.
[02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:27.360]   Control is full of brutal, what they call brutalist architecture.
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:29.040]   Oh, hey, I made that.
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:30.800]   I know you did. Thanks.
[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:33.280]   I shot that on my iPhone.
[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:36.800]   This is real New York stuff.
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:43.760]   Wow, now I can't wait. That'll be coming out in a couple of weeks. She's working on it right now.
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:45.920]   Awesome. Thank you, Simone.
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:47.520]   Thank you for letting me plug.
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:53.680]   Of course, Ian Thompson is our favorite Scotsman.
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:57.120]   He writes for the registered--
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.880]   My birth is not accent, but not accent.
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:04.320]   Yeah, I know. He's got some posh upper-class accent replaced his good Scottish brogue.
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:06.320]   If you had to, could you scotify it?
[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:15.680]   I could, but I'd sound a wee bit, you know, false, but I have just put on the ILC channel
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:19.680]   a British fry-up, which is the best food ever created.
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:27.040]   But yeah, no, my Scots heritage I'm proud of. I looked damn good in a kill, got married in one.
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:37.520]   Yeah. See, this kind of really makes cast some doubt on your judgment regarding the Popeyes
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:43.600]   chicken sandwich. Oh, come on, look. You've got black pudding at three o'clock on the right hand
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:46.400]   side. What is black pudding made out of Ian Thompson?
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:51.360]   Fuse. Oh, it's blood, fat and oatmeal.
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:54.400]   And it's blood that makes it black. Yeah.
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:22:00.320]   OK, just checking. But, you know, basically, black pudding and haggis. Black pudding is blood
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:08.880]   and as fat. Haggis is sheep's heart, lungs and entrails. It's what my Scottish uncle called
[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:13.120]   what's left of the sheep after some English bastard has gone through and stolen the rest of it.
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:19.600]   But I mean, I mean, look at it. It's glorious. The sausage bake bean, damn.
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:25.680]   You know, the bacon is that appetite for a Popeyes chicken sandwich. Yeah, I'm good.
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:32.160]   I mean, I don't know anything more again. I'm full for life after the haggis is complete.
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:35.200]   I think I think that's like a Scottish prank. I don't think people actually eat those.
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:39.440]   I think they put them out to scare people. I think it's a hangover. You'd be, you know,
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:46.000]   kidding? I would I ate that in 20 minutes flat and was just give me more, you know,
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:51.120]   it's comatose. That would kill me. If I ate that much food, you can roll me on the wheelbarrow.
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:57.280]   You know what? There's no sugar in it at all. But, you know, I got criticism online for that
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:04.000]   because I didn't include fried bread and I didn't include grilled tomato. Now, grilled tomato,
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:10.880]   not how I roll, fried bread. It was just it was enough food as it was, but a proper British fry up.
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:15.920]   Seriously, that is the that's the dog's bollocks. It's just that's my point exactly.
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:22.080]   The dog's the dog's the dog's the register.
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:24.880]   That's the reason dogs lick them.
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:33.520]   And Alex will help. Thank you so much for being here from my childhood home in beautiful Rhode
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:36.480]   Island. He writes for Tech Crunch. Anything you want to plug?
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:44.560]   So I'm on a meal that you like to eat anything, you know, I mean, I'm learning how to cook,
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:48.960]   but I'll just I'll just say this. I've never had haggis and I'm going to die that way.
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:51.920]   I'm going to die a better man for it. And with that, we can go back to you, Leo.
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:56.320]   What's the name of that cute dog on your Twitter account? That is a cute little puppy.
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:02.320]   Oh, that's one of our two little havinies. That dog is a scotty. He is the smaller of the two
[02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:05.920]   and they're both inside the house right now. Probably bean brats. I'm going to go inside
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:11.040]   and get them to school. Scott Scott Scott Scott. Even if he's a habani.
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:15.520]   He does watch a lot of Scottish television because I watch Scottish television. So he's
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:21.520]   a he's a fan, but he speaks no English sadly. There he is. And of course, Alex is the only
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:27.120]   person I know on Twitter that has a balance sheet for his big Twitter photo background.
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:32.720]   Okay. That's what I hear faintly laughing. That's John. That's John.
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:38.480]   Cameron V are our technical director for the show today. John is our studio audience for the day.
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:42.480]   It's kind of fantastic. It's kind of like the tonight show where it's just people who work here
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:46.240]   that can laugh at the jokes. I'm glad he's having a good time. He's having a good time.
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:53.120]   Thank you, Simone. Thank you so much, Ian. Thank you so much, Alex. You guys are great.
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:59.280]   This has been the most bizarre twit in history. And I loved every second of it.
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:04.960]   Thank you so much. We do this. We can tech our technically it's a news round table this week.
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:11.520]   I don't know what it was. We do it every Sunday around 230 Pacific five 30 Eastern 21 30 UTC.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:17.040]   You can watch or listen live. Now, if you're in the UK, if you go to twit.tv/live,
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:21.360]   there's all video feeds and audio feeds. But I do want a little programming note. If you're in
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:27.520]   the UK, there are two audio feeds. There's tune in and spreaker tune in after an adverse court
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:33.120]   ruling will no longer play United States podcast in the UK. They're terrified of Sony and Warner
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:39.520]   music. So it will say that we are. Yes, we are blocked on tuning UK, which is nuts.
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:46.000]   Because I didn't even play fleet with Max dreams. So I you know, but anyway, that's the way it is.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.520]   But you so anywhere in the world except the UK, you can listen on tuning.
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:55.440]   Spreaker does work in case you use the spreaker channel. I apologize. Also, if you watch us on
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:58.880]   Roku, as you might already know, we're certainly getting a lot of email.
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:05.120]   Roku will change their API, broke our app. You can't watch a twit on Roku through the
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:10.640]   twit, the old twit app. There are other ways. There's probably the best of the YouTube app.
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:15.520]   But we are looking at there is apparently Roku has another way to do if you have a RSS feed,
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:18.560]   which obviously we do. There's another way to do it. We wouldn't get the live stuff,
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:23.280]   but you'd least get the shows and you could watch the video. We are working on that. Meanwhile,
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:29.520]   come to our website, twit.tv to download shows, audio or video, or subscribe in your favorite
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:35.120]   podcast client because all podcast clients can get it. And you'll that way you'll have it for
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:43.120]   Monday morning and your early morning fry up. There's nothing.
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:44.280]   Food of the cause. Nothing.
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:45.280]   Food of the cause.
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:50.000]   Black sausage with your morning twit. Thank you. Everybody will see you next time.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.080]   Another twit is in the can. I got to go to Popeyes. I can't take it anymore.
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:58.400]   You guys are driving me insane.
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:07.840]   Do the twit. All right. Do the twit, baby. Do the twit. All right. Do the twit.
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:18.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
