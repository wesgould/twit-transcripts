[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.480]   It's time for tech, where at least something vaguely approaching
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.200]   tech-- actually, no, there's not going to be any tech
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.440]   in this show today at all.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.960]   You know why?
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.160]   Because we've got the best damn cast
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.600]   we've ever had in our lives.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.680]   In studio with me right now from scam school and NSFW,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.160]   Mr. Brian, my hair is standing on end
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.880]   because I'm so excited to be here, Brushwood.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.280]   That's exactly correct.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.800]   Thank you, Leo, for having me in studio.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   It's always good to be here.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.760]   Shwood.com.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.840]   Indeed, sir.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.200]   Also, to Brian's left, virtually speaking--
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.160]   Oh, it's like what?
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760]   --the lovely Felicia Day, the star of the Guild,
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.640]   and of a new sci-fi channel show called--
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.600]   Oh, it's a movie, Red.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.160]   Red?
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.800]   Oh, you were looping for Red.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.440]   Yes.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.480]   But then you have a new show.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.280]   You're going to be a regular on--
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.000]   Oh, I'm going to be recurring on Eureka.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.920]   That's why I'm leaving Thursday for Vancouver.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.760]   So that's exciting.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.360]   Goodness gracious.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.040]   She's so busy.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.800]   And yet, there's a new season of the Guild coming out.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.480]   Yeah, did you see this painting behind me?
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.760]   Look at that.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.960]   That's the Will Wheaton cover, the bodice-ripper version.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.800]   Wow, I didn't realize that there was an actual painting.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.240]   Oh, no, that's going to be in the episode on Tuesday.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   So stay tuned, the premiere of the painting.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   I'd love to know the story behind that thing.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.560]   It's a good story.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320]   It's just basically my Kindle obsession
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.680]   allowed me to read all the books I was too embarrassed to buy.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.320]   And that's why I thought of the story point,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.160]   to have this crazy painting.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.800]   I love it.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.160]   It's so nice to have you, Felicia.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.800]   And we'll find out more about the upcoming season
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.520]   of the Guild in just a bit and all the other projects
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.200]   you're working on.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.640]   But let me introduce also.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.480]   Mr. John C. have a nice day de Vorac.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.640]   You don't recognize this.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.600]   Did you get that hat on-- yes, that's Microsoft Bob.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.240]   So I'm digging around the closet trying to clean out the place,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.840]   and I found that this hat.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.960]   But more importantly, and I'm putting this up
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   for auction, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.080]   And I couldn't believe I even had it.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.320]   A Bob Frisbee.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.760]   Wow.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.320]   That should get a buck 50 somewhere.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.360]   I'm thinking more.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.200]   Do you think there's a marketplace for Bob?
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.000]   For Bob memorabilia?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.920]   No.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.440]   No.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.280]   That was unfortunate.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.360]   Who would want that?
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.240]   I don't know.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.440]   I think the hat-- I think the hat would be good.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.600]   What about the paper clip guy?
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.480]   That's Steven Spielberg, not this exact one.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.560]   But he wore it Bob hat when they rolled out the first announcement
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.920]   for DreamWorks.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.000]   Spielberg had a Bob hat on.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.560]   Did Microsoft have an investment in that?
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.760]   Was he wearing it like ironically or--
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.600]   Call me Bob.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.480]   Apparently, I think Paul Allen had some money in there
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.320]   and some other people.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.680]   I don't know.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.200]   Interesting.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.160]   So also with us, Mr. Barrett-Tunde Thurston, who has--
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.640]   A kindly taken time off from his new book to join us.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.120]   Recently, deputized.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.640]   As well.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.880]   You're a deputy?
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.840]   We deputized him as the producer for this episode.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.200]   Really?
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.800]   I was dragged into duties, extraordinary circumstances
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.640]   called for the activation.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.600]   Or for my service.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   Or for my service.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.920]   Co-producer of this week's show.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.640]   Well, I think you're the official runner up.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.200]   So if I'm unable to perform my duties, you step in.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.240]   He's the vice-lamp.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.000]   And you reckon--
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.400]   As long as I get a gun, I'm happy.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.200]   You get a gun.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.360]   All right.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.120]   Things can go crazy.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.040]   You never know.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.520]   So Barrett-Tunde actually did some work prepping for this show.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.400]   And since he's the only one who did,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.760]   we're going to deputize him and let him start.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   But we were talking before the show began.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.280]   We were talking about something--
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.920]   Well, you know about photo bombing, right?
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.240]   Photo bombing, everybody knows best.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.480]   Just heard that out of your mouth for the first time right now.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   Well, I don't know if it's like a Google bombing thing
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.160]   or the whole jumping in the background and ruining--
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.600]   It's the jumping in the background, exactly.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.120]   OK, yeah.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.480]   Yeah, messing up other people's photos.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.720]   Right.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.080]   So there's a new photo bombing where you take a photo bomb.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.880]   Photo bomb is like there's a cute couple posing for the picture.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.440]   And then a waitress in the back going, ah!
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.600]   And you don't know that it happened until you go home
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.400]   and you look at your pictures and go, oh, this is ruined
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.840]   by that waitress.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.320]   But digital camera's ruined that because now you know right away.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.680]   That's true.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.440]   But digital editing software solves it
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.680]   because we have Photoshop now.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.840]   Photoshop.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.200]   Well, it's Photoshop bombing.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.960]   I think this is what's happened now.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.720]   So this is a meme that is now making the rounds where
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   you take a photo bomb.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.720]   And instead of editing out the bed,
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.000]   you take the funny face and you put it on everybody's face.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.080]   All right, I still have an NSFW episode here.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.280]   Yeah, I think this is the kind of thing you do on NSFW.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.760]   And then do you do it in real time, though?
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.240]   You ask people to submit theirs.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.280]   No, we unleash the demon hordes of the internet.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.680]   And it's amazing what they can accomplish in no time.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.760]   So go to thisisphotobomb.com.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.160]   This is photobomb.com?
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.040]   This is so epic.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.800]   Go down to, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 photos down.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.720]   And you'll see a classic example of what we're talking about.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.680]   OK.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.360]   It's the guy who has sunglasses and somebody behind him.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.320]   Oh, dear.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.680]   Well, no.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.160]   It looks like it's Barretunde, but that's
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.760]   because I haven't pressed the button.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.800]   All right, here's the guy.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.480]   It looks-- he's wearing sunglasses, but behind him,
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.320]   I think the woman--
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.040]   There seems to be--
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   There seems to be this guy who's gut.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   Oh!
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.040]   That's horrifying.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   So that's--
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.800]   I'm bad.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.280]   But that's not a new meme.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.600]   That's the old meme.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.000]   Now we got--
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.640]   It's very funny.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.800]   But it's still the best.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.000]   Well, it's good to explain what photobombing is
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.760]   so that I'm trying to find--
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.680]   I was looking at this all day this morning,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.760]   and it was so funny, and now I can't find it.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.320]   Where you Photoshop the photobomb,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.160]   somebody will send me a chat room link, right?
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.080]   Yeah, the demon hordes.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.560]   This is lying, right?
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.400]   We're calling it photobombing, but it's lying.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.900]   Right?
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.640]   That's what we're doing.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.040]   It's the next-- yeah, well, it's the next stage.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.040]   That's the popular dude thing.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.160]   You take a photobomb, and then you add other people's--
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.840]   you take the bad picture, and you put--
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.640]   you spread it throughout.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.000]   Is it like manbabies?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.520]   Remember that?
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.320]   Manbabies.com?
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.720]   Yes, exactly like that.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   That was my favorite.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.280]   Yeah, it's exactly like manbabies.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.200]   But now I can't find the link, so I'm sorry.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.720]   Even bro--
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.520]   No, well, there we go.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.200]   The whole segment goes down to two.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.120]   He's always--
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120]   He's waited.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.640]   --wrong with me.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   Well, that didn't take long.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.440]   It didn't take--
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:56.940]   You know what?
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.760]   Art of the next story.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.600]   Art of the next story.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.840]   --stokes that this was all just a big mistake,
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   and it was something that Leo dreamed,
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.640]   and we start to be reading right now.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.320]   Wasn't that be good?
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.840]   It could be.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.100]   It could be.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.140]   I just dreamed it.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.100]   No, I was looking at it.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.440]   You know what?
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.940]   It'll probably be on here.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.300]   I was looking at it on my pooter.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.300]   My iPad.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   My iPad.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.780]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.780]   Excuse me?
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.620]   It was a dream, wasn't it?
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.500]   My pooter had it.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.540]   OK, I'm sorry I even brought it up.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.300]   Hey, what happened to the unofficial guy who's
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.060]   supposed to keep track of things here?
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.100]   Would you step in, deputy Dan, and--
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   Absolutely this--
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.600]   --this show.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.900]   Let's get the show actually started.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.400]   Big story.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:32.900]   Big story.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.100]   Let's get a big story.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.900]   Let's get a big story.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.300]   Audio, video, test phase of the show.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.900]   And why don't we start off--
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.200]   actually, this is a pretty interesting story-- Clive Thompson,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.500]   the great writer who does work with Wired,
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.100]   and all sorts of other magazines,
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.000]   had a story about how no one's making phone calls anymore,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.200]   the incredible shrinking cell phone bill.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.000]   And through his studies, especially of younger people,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.200]   it's something we've all anecdotally, probably observed,
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.000]   but minutes of use per cell phone user
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.400]   as tracked by the official sources are actually declining.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.800]   Does this surprise anybody at all?
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.300]   I mean, doesn't everybody text now?
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.200]   Felicia, you probably don't make phone calls anymore, do you?
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.800]   I actually hate phone calls more than anything.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.600]   I have kind of a phone phobia.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   So if there's any way that I can avoid speaking to somebody--
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.900]   I mean, literally, if somebody calls me
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.600]   and I'm not expecting it, it's like somebody
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   throwing up on my doorstep.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.900]   It's so invasive to me.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.500]   You don't want to talk to somebody in the phone.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.500]   See, me, I don't want to make a phone call.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.900]   Leo, you don't want to talk to anybody.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.000]   No, that's true.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.800]   And you know why?
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.300]   After that last segment, you know why.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.200]   I'm embarrassed that I'm so goofy, so messed up.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.500]   No, they're an amazing website.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.700]   Are you shy, Felicia?
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.500]   Are you shy?
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.700]   Is that what's going on?
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.000]   I mean, I just don't like things that are unexpected.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.900]   So, yeah, I don't like--
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.100]   I think we generally phone calls are something,
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.400]   somebody wanting something, or like business,
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   or, you know, I love my mom, but sometimes she
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.800]   wants to talk about the stakes that are on sale at Target
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   for like an hour, and I don't have time for that.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.600]   They sell stake at Target?
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.200]   Yeah, they do sell everything at Target.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.000]   Really?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.600]   Do you know?
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   Are they good stakes?
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.600]   I'm not sure we don't have one in LA.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   But we only have the time to your room.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   Would you have your mom call me?
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.600]   I'd like to know more.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.800]   Well, this point that you raised, Felicia,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.200]   about you know, you don't want--
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.600]   people want something.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.800]   And I think like we're used to such asymmetric communication.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.400]   Like a text is not that distracting because you don't have
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.200]   to engage with it when it comes in, same with an email.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.800]   To some extent, even with an instant message,
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.200]   that's not necessarily synchronous.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.000]   You can pretend you're not there and kind of let the conversation
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.600]   go, walk away from the computer, but a phone call is this sort of old school?
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.000]   Like, I want your time.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I want it right now.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.400]   I don't care what you're doing.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   And what Clive talks about in the article is that there's no presence detection.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.200]   You people don't know if you're busy or not.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.400]   Right.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   So you-- someone just calling you out of the blue.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.200]   You could be in the middle of something very important.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   There's no status associated with phone availability.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   The same way there is with these other communications.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.400]   This reminds me of the discovery that people must have made
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.600]   when the phone was first invented.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.200]   It's like, what is this thing ringing in my living room?
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.800]   And I don't want it there.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.400]   Well, I think the novelty early on made it clearly the best mode of communication
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   compared to, you know, Pony Express.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.200]   But what I like most about the article is the asymmetry allows certain things.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.400]   For example, you sound smarter when you send a text message
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   because you can rewrite it four or five times.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   And you get to make sure you say exactly what you want
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   and exactly the right amount of words.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   And you have, you know, by its very nature, it's acceptable to get it.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   As you mentioned, either 30 seconds or, you know, five minutes or even hours away.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   I think text-- Do you sound dumber when you spell your, you are?
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   Oh, I think I can't handle it, man.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   When everyone sends me like shortened, you know, you are, you know, letter U letter R.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   It's like, I will rewrite.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   I write in complete sentences using proper punctuation.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   And I just can't not do it.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   And I don't know why.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   And it just kind of encourages self-centeredness, doesn't it?
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   Because it's like we're going to communicate on our own terms
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   and not really care about what the other person needs or wants from us.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   I mean, that basically, right?
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   I think we just proven that this entire panel is intensely neurotic.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   I'm not blind in any of it.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   I think these self-absorbed and neurotic--
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   They're neurotic, they're demanding.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   But I do think about--
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   Well, there's so many ways that people can get to you.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   I mean, there's just no solitude anymore.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   So I don't know.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   I kind of look at it like that.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.400]   You know, I look at my caller ID and I say, do I want to take this call?
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   No.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   And so I just don't answer the phone.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   And if I do answer the phone, I'm curt and terse into that, too.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   But don't people--
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   Why are you calling me?
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   Yeah, actually, John invented this.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   You can call John.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   In fact, for a long time, you didn't even have voicemail.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   You didn't have an answering machine.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   I still don't.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   So if you call John, it rings, and that's all.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   That's it.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   You invented this, John.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.400]   What am I talking about?
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   This is your--
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   Let me give you a backstory, because this actually began when there's little--
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   You used to buy these voice answering machines, and they used to play tapes.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   And you had a few of your friends do these cute tapes that were kind of little plays
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   or crazy things.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   Oh, I hated that.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   They would go on for hours.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   Nobody's home.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   Nobody's home.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   Nobody's home.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   Nobody's home.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.400]   Not quite that lame.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   That was better than most of them, I thought.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.400]   Well, maybe.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   So anyway, what happens is that I was traveling a lot during this era, and then I get--
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   Come back, it would be 95 phone calls backed up.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   And then I had one or two guys chew me out.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   Why didn't you return my call?
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   No.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   And so what I noticed is that if you don't pick up at all, in other words, the phone just
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   rings forever, nobody gets mad at you.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   It's their responsibility.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   Felicia, you should try this.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   Is this a new thing you could do?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   Just don't answer.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   I don't ever answer the phone.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.400]   And take off the voicemail.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   She's already doing it, apparently.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   No, but she has voicemail.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   See, there's your mistake.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   Oh, voicemail is no good.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   Because voicemail, they think they reached you.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   Well, but it's like a pit.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   It's a vast pit.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   So people know after a while that if they leave a message, they'll get me 20 times faster
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   if they just email me or text me.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   How long before I think we're going to see a movement in this country of resistors who
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   don't have-- I'm the first--
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   You don't have-- you don't have Facebook.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   You don't have Twitter.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   You don't have voicemail.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   You don't even have email.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   We're going to see people who are going to turn away from all this technology because
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   it's overloading us.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.400]   I'm going to go out on a limb and say, "You're in a different position than most of America."
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   Most people don't have that problem?
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   Most people are not inundated with thousands of requests for their attention every single day.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   Felicia, just me and Felicia.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   I'm just asking the job that you're looking for.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   So people want to get calls.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   Like, meanwhile, I'm about tempted to give out my public cell phone number right now.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   Oh, come on.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   I just want people calling me.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   Do it.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   Do it.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   It does.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   Okay.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.400]   So here it is.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   This is the picture.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   This is a nice couple.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   They're in a restaurant, right?
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   Isn't that sad?
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   The waitress comes up behind him and makes probably the ugliest face.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   I mean, really?
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   If we zoom in--
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   She has a condition, Leo.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   She's got a condition.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   That is just a horrible face.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   It's like a puppet.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   There's a lot of pity tips.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.400]   So here's what you do.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   You search Fel's palsy.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.900]   Thanks to the chat room for telling me it's photo bomb face swapping is the new name.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.400]   This is photo bomb face swapping.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   What you do is you take that horrible face and you put it on everybody.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   And now--
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   Well, I don't know what.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   This is why the Chinese economy will soon surpass the US economy.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   Because we're busy doing this.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.400]   This is so brilliant.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.400]   It takes it to the next level.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   Okay.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   Happy family.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   You know, it's a little bit of an awkward family photo, but what's going on with a 10-year-old,
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.400]   she's got a weird-- she's making a weird face.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   So what we'll do is-- oh, actually, it's that person.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   There's a person underneath the couch.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   There's a story right there.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   There's a story right there.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   There's sitting on a guy.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   So this is a very weird awkward family.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   That's the kid that they didn't want to admit that they had.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   So if you zoom in, you see that--
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   Oh, he's actually part of her leg.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.400]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   She's got a-- so that could be a birth defect.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   She's got a face leg.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   She's got a face leg.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   You know.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   She's got a face leg.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   It's a new condition.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   Here's a picture.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.400]   This is from the World Cup.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   It's all those processed foods.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   It's very serious, but there's a weird guy with big eyes behind him making a funny face.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   So what you do is you take those big eyes.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   You see right there?
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   And you give them to everybody.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   OK, I just thought I'd mention the new--
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   I find just to be hilarious.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   Search for-- you want to see more of it?
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   Search for photo bomb face swap.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   Thank you, Sharon, for making me--
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   See, they did it against that.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   It wasn't a dream.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   It didn't even happen.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   It wasn't a dream.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   It wasn't a dream.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   It really did happen.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   And the spirits did it in one night.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   So here's a story.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   I'm going to-- we'll trade back and forth, Barretun.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   The jailbreak--
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   That sounds great.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   It'll be like ping pong.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   One of my favorite sports.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   Tech News ping pong on Twitch today.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   iPhone 4 has been jailbroken already.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   Didn't take long.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   Yay.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   You can now go to jailbreakme.com and it has kind of like an all-in-one push button jailbreak.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   And now it's legal.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   Yeah, I'm sure they waited until it was legal.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.400]   They were very concerned.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.400]   Yeah, it's legal.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   So what is--
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.400]   My past history with Joe Off.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.400]   Well, no, they can't cut you off.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400]   Could they cut you off?
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   Sure.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   They could just-- so the FCC rulings doesn't mean that they couldn't just say, "Well, okay, but we're--
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   Yeah, you can do whatever you want.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   It's totally legal, but, you know, we're not going to get any services.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   We're not going to get any services.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   You're just broken your warranty.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   That's the old excuse.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   Oh, you can do that, but then you ruin your warranty.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   That's what Apple said.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   That's what Apple said.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   It's legal to unscrew your cell phone, but if it's got a little sticker saying,
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   if you remove this screw, you lose your warranty.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   That's what Apple said.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   That's what Apple said.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   It's weird about the fact that--
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   Go ahead, Barry Tunday.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   Here's my key question about this, because I got the original iPhone and jail broke it
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   to work on T-Mobile, so I didn't break my plan and I loved it.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   I had Cydia apps running.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   It tasted like freedom, and I like freedom.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   Tastes like freedom.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   But I also--
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   They just write that down.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   I honestly felt like a fugitive because I was running, you know, week to week, month to month,
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   in fear of the latest software update.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   So I'm kind of like sniffing around.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   I don't want to have my phone un-jail broken by Apple's latest push.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   Does this new ruling that jailbreaking is legal now prevent Apple from undoing your jailbreak
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   in its latest software updates?
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   Are they still going to have that practice of sabotaging your phone at their own whim?
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   Does jailbreaking is make it work either as a phone or an internet device?
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   Because mine is literally an operable brick, and I don't know if anything else is in LA,
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   but I think I'm pretty close to actually swapping it out because it just does not work.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   I've yet to have a phone call that didn't drop.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   But you don't want phone calls, Felicia.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   This is a feature.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   That's true.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   That's a feature.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   That's a feature.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   This is like-- the iPhone 4 is like a girlfriend who drives you nuts.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   She won't pay attention to you.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   She never listens to you.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   She breaks everything.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   But oh my God, she's so hot.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   I can't-- I can't give her up.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:53.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is why Co-Ed magazine says NSFW is a must-listen to podcast.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   That's exactly right.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   Can you go over that laundry list again?
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   I was highly amused.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   I didn't even understand it.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   Dude, the iPhone is so messed up.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.400]   Is it very accurate?
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   The reception's up and down, but the--
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   Have you had a boyfriend like that?
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   Felicia Day, have you had a boyfriend like that?
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   Oh, no, I'm very choosy.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.400]   Your iPhone 4 is your boyfriend like that.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   Uh, yeah, I mean, and I'm about to give him the boot.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   I mean, it's just-- it's ridiculous how much money I pay a month.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   I feel like, uh, you know, I should be able to pay a percentage of a bill for the percentage
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   that the phone actually works.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   Too bad that's not legal.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   Well, now jailbreak is not going to fix that.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   This is cool though.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   You go to the site.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   And basically, it's a web page and it says jailbreak me.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   It works on all the iPhone devices and you slide-- it's on the phone.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.400]   You slide the jailbreak.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   Nice.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   That's it.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   That's an iPhone 4 here.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   They want a jailbreak.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   Anybody in the studio?
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.400]   I do.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   I'm looking around like a fugitive.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.400]   Boy, I'm getting a lot of money.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   I can't return to that life.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Nobody once says that guts to do it.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   No, if I had my iPhone 4 here, I would absolutely do it because--
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   I'll do it.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   I'll do it.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   All right.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   There's this awkward moment.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   It's like, are you serious?
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   Are you really real?
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   I don't know.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   I don't care.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   We need some jailbreaking.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.200]   By the way, in answer to my original question, chatroom is weighing in saying Apple updates
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.400]   do undo your jailbreakage.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   Yes, of course they do.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   It was listening.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.400]   Did you ask that question?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.400]   I did.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   That's all right.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   I could jailbreak it now.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   In fact, a new update came out last night.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   It was downloading as I said.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.400]   401?
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   Is one even passed 401?
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   I don't know.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.400]   I know that I finally synced my--
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   We just didn't get around to it.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   Yeah, 401 came out a while.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   Go to jailbreakme.com and Safari.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   All right.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   What could go wrong here?
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   Oh, it works on iPad.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   You don't have to do it.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   I'll do it to my iPad.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.400]   All right.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   Maybe I'll do it anyway.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   You want to do it?
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   No one will use this.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   I don't know.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   What do you mean it doesn't make any sense?
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   Jailbreakme.com.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   Does it work on my chocolate phone?
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   You have a chocolate phone?
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   You are so black.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   Chocolate L.G.D.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   You did it.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   That was terrible.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   That was terrible.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   Just make--
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   Okay, I have to explain that.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   I have to explain that.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:13.400]   I have to explain that.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   I actually prefer if you leave it hanging awkwardly out there.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   What is the name of your new book?
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   How to eat chocolate?
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   No.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   What is the name of your new book?
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   I am going to get a hate mail.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   What is it?
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   How to be black.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   And is one of the steps have a chocolate phone?
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   No.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   Can you have an old brown June?
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   Oh my God.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   Oh my God.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   Oh.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   Oh.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   I am going to get so much email now.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   Fortunately, I don't have any.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   I live on a gig here.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400]   But that is cool.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   That is cool.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   No.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   You have the theme for the final Jeopardy.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   You know where they play that little song.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   Well, you just say jailbreak.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.400]   Should I play that?
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   So in addition to jailbreaking,
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   we will also be breaking copyright laws.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   Is that what you want to do?
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.400]   Is that where you are talking?
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   I think it is public domain.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   No.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   You can tell that to Goodman and Todson.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   Go tell that to jailbreak me.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   Have you ever been on a gig?
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   Anybody been on Jeopardy?
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   I have been on two game shows and never got picked for either of them.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   I have a really good friend of mine was on Jeopardy.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   But I have never done it.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   Do they tell you all the answers before the show?
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   Because we got it up on both of them now.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   I had a friend on Jeopardy too.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   Wait, that is Facebook.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   Facebook.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.400]   I am getting Facebook updates.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   This is like, you look great on Twitter.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.400]   Hey, you are beautiful.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   You got a girlfriend?
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   Okay, jailbreakme.com.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   There it is.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   It is just to get you do it in Safari.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   Come on, let's do it.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   Let me get the Jeopardy sounds first.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   Who would?
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.400]   Dr. Mom was on Jeopardy.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   What was that like Dr. Mom for you?
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   Was that a good experience?
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   Forget the Jeopardy theme.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.400]   You need the Empire theme.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.400]   Can I slide yours?
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.400]   Yeah, go for it.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.400]   Okay.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   So go slide yours.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   Don't do it.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   I am a slide mine.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.400]   I am a school-age.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   This is like watching a train wreck, guys.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   I am so excited.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   It broke mine downloading this book.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   It reset mine.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   Wow.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   This is some scary stuff.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   I am not going to have a funny one.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.400]   You just whashed the money down the toilet.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   Wow.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   She was psycho.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   She was hot.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   Yeah, she was hot, but she was psycho.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   Jeez.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   I am going to try to wipe her brain to make her normal.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   This is like really troubling.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   It says, "Sit tight now."
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   I know, we got to stop with that.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   That is worse than the chocolate.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   This is terrifying.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   I am glad to say it is not my iPhone.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.400]   Brian Rushwood's iPhone is about to die.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   It is amazing how easily he is influenced by the group of us in some sort of...
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   Well, this is just reinforcing my psycho girlfriend idea because this is like we are at a party
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   where you should totally break up with their man.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.400]   Just do it.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   Just do it right now.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   Go over.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   And I walk over there and you guys are all drinking like, "I can't believe he is doing it."
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.400]   You are really going to break up your pressure at work.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   You are not going to take a kitchen for a butter knife, but a butcher knife.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.400]   By the way, this never is a way that just stays like this forever now.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   I need a butter nut.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.400]   You know, I will be sad if I lose all my...
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   Oh no, I backed up my pictures.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400]   I backed everything up.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   You got to lose anything.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   Dude, that is the beauty of this.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.400]   Nothing will go wrong.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   All you now have is access to the city.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.400]   We all know time after time going to strange websites that you just heard about and allowing it root access.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   Nothing ever goes wrong.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   What could go wrong?
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   It is completely solid.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   Just say, "Good idea."
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   Use your agreement, yes.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   Yes.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   Is there a user agreement?
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   A EULA on this?
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   That would be pretty funny.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   I get a personal email from Steve Jobs tomorrow.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   That would be hysterical.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.400]   Saw you last night, Brushwood.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   You're out.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   You know, why is this for Kathy Griffin in the car?
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   Remember in the limousine when my sucky A-list B-list life?
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   I just take so live on the D-list.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400]   Life on the D-list?
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   No, it's almost done.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   See, it's got a little tip of white there, and then it'll be done.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.400]   The event is going to be like a prank thing, and all of a sudden it's going to show inappropriate photos.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   That would be good.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   So I'm going to get a manicure before I...
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400]   Okay.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   Do you get manicure?
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   I have to worry about that for scam school.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   Don't you?
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   I keep telling men they need to at least, you know, you got to keep it regular, especially
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   the pedicure.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   It's advisable.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   Are you saying men should get pedicures?
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.400]   Occasionally.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.400]   I see it's your role right there.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   She actually believes this.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.400]   Have you seen it?
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   Have you seen people's feet?
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   I believe what Felicia Day believes.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   Do you get a pedicure?
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   Me?
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   Okay.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   Me?
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   No, no.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   I know you do.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.160]   I've been known to treat myself to an occasional dose of the finer things in life, including
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160]   a pedicure.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   You're very metra.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   I get a pedicure.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.600]   I used to get a manicure, and then tech TV told me they cost too much.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.400]   You were charging tech TV for your manicures?
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   Well, of course I was.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   Of course I was.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   Of course I was.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.040]   Dude, I don't put them on my tax returns.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   I don't write them off.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040]   Oh, you better.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   You should.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   Look it.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   Look it.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   See this?
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   All right.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   My hands now on TV.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.680]   I need IRS.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   What is this?
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.280]   My hands are on TV and you need to.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.280]   Okay.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.280]   Now what is this?
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.520]   Sedia has been added to the home screen.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   Have fun.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520]   You're done, dude.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.520]   What?
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   You're broke.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.520]   I'm now a renegade.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520]   You are a renegade.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520]   It works.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.520]   It works.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.160]   What are your special powers now?
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.560]   Now, it just has a new app store called Sedia.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.400]   You guys don't understand what's like to be on the other side.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.240]   You see the world different, you know?
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.240]   Everyone.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.400]   Everyone looks so great to me.

[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   You're such a rebel.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.040]   You're supposed to keep your foot on the break because you're supposed to stop when you get
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.040]   to the parking space and I didn't.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   There's video of this, unfortunately.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   What you're saying is that it's almost idiot proof.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   No, but I'm the idiot.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   It's not proof.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   Here's the thing, but this flex.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   I mean, he must have been five miles an hour and we hit the boom.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.040]   There's people in the Fiesta.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.040]   There's actually engineers laughing in the back in the Fiesta.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   I hit it hard.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.040]   I thought, "Oh, this is a big car with a big bumper."
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   I felt so terrible.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.040]   Oh my God.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.680]   I mean, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.440]   I got out and this is all on video.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.960]   Not a scratch on the Fiesta, not a scratch on the Flex.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.200]   It was a pretty good test.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   Thank God.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   I don't know.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.640]   The Fiesta is a brand new design from Ford.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.040]   The most fuel efficient compact car out there.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.480]   EPA estimated to get ready for this.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   It's not a hybrid.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   It's a gas car.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.280]   40 miles to the gallon.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.680]   Amazing engine in the 2011 Fiesta.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.760]   It's a 1.6 liter Dura Tech.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   A lot of initials here.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.720]   T-I-V-C-T-I-4 engine.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.000]   I've seen one of these in person.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.160]   They look like they're from the future.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   They do.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   They're really cool.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   No, especially if I was looking for a first car.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   I mean, I've got a family and kids in a big show.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.160]   It's a very affordable car.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.120]   It's a good car for a city.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.480]   If you lived in New York or somewhere where you didn't have big parking places, if you
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.200]   avoid the flexes, it's great.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   There are optional features like heated leather trimmed seats.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.360]   You're not really sacrificing here if you don't want power shift, six speed automatic
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.360]   transmission.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.080]   Of course, the voice activated sync that you know I wouldn't live with that anymore.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.640]   That's the hands-free calling, so you don't miss a call.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.560]   Or you can just say, "No, I don't want to call."
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   It's more...
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.120]   Turned by Alicia Day.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.120]   You get Leo.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.320]   It was kind of weird because they have...
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.000]   On the Android phones, they'll read your text messages on the sync when they come in.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.200]   So I said to somebody, "Send me a message."
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.400]   She sent me a kind of a dirty message.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.000]   And the sync just read it.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   It was pretty sync doesn't care.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   It's cool.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Sync doesn't care.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Sync won't judge you.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.880]   Yeah, it didn't judge me.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   No.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   Wow.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   Not even when you crashed it.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   It was...
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   Wow.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.520]   911 Assist, voice activated music and podcast browsing.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.240]   All in the new 2011 Ford Fiesta.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.160]   If you haven't taken a look at one drive one this week at a Ford dealer near you.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.280]   I love the exterior.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.280]   The interior is really roomy.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.760]   If you get in the back seat, you'll see what I mean.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.040]   It's not making any sacrifices.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   It is brand new.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.640]   I think most Ford dealers now have the 2011 Fiesta.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.480]   So go buy and drive one today.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.480]   I like this.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.400]   Have you seen the Fiesta ads where all the things come out and stuff?
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.400]   It's really cool.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.480]   I haven't seen it, but can we see what the MSRP is?
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.920]   Like what price range it is for people?
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.080]   I think they started 12.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   Really?
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   12 to 20.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   All right.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.720]   So, yeah, it's a car for somebody who really wants a great car but doesn't want to spend
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   a lot of money.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.400]   Did Brian Bush would just say MSRP instead of price?
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:19.360]   Well, because if you say price that doesn't necessarily say MSRP because since it's an
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.760]   advertisement, they have all kinds of agreements about what prices they can't say.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.440]   I probably not supposed to even say a price, right?
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.440]   Right.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   Exactly.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.200]   So it's like, you know, the MSRP is what you're allowed to say all the time in public and
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.040]   then that way wherever you can visit your dealer and find out if, you know, the MSRP
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.600]   is from 13, 320.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   Okay.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Besides, I watch too much.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   The price is right.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   No.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.480]   That was the whole point of me bringing that up.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   Oh, really?
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   You cut them.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.480]   Just MSRP.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.840]   That's just the fine print and car commercials.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   That's cool.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.280]   And is that what they say on the price is right?
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   Is MSRP?
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   All right.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.280]   Yeah, they do.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.280]   They do.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.040]   It's all about being able to estimate prices.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.160]   So Felicia Day, you would be embarrassed to buy a book or how to be black but you admit
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   to watching prices, right?
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160]   I love prices.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   I was kidding.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.120]   I mean, I couldn't be embarrassed.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.320]   It'd be an interesting book.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   I'm just saying.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   This is just great product placement.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   You know, I know.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.320]   I'm just selling your book, Bertha.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.200]   Now you can thank me later.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.160]   They'll be burning crosses on my lawn tomorrow, but you can thank me later.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   Oh my God.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   Leo.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   You're doing it again, Leo.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   Come on.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   I'm not going to light them.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.080]   I'm not going to wear a sheet.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.080]   What do you think?
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   You think it's me?
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.880]   I want to try to do something here.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.200]   I want to try to get us back on tech track.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   Thank you.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   All right.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.840]   So first of all, from my Twitter community, Felicia Day, you got an incredibly lovely
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.680]   shout out from corduroy who can't wait for the crossover guild dollhouse event to happen.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.080]   And she's just a super fan and wants to say hello to you.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   And she doesn't have access.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.640]   You can answer her phone calls.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.400]   Oh, that's I'm sorry.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:58.240]   As for the tech stuff, a big gem in the chat room actually tipped us off to this August
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:05.840]   $150 Android tablet hitting Kmart later this month, $150.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.840]   This month.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:12.560]   The tablet later this according to an end gadget story just threw it up in the room and their
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   latest update.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:19.680]   They've got a video of it running 2.1 and it's supposed to be hitting Kmart's some vaguely
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.680]   later this month.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.040]   They just showed up in the circular and everybody went and they said, no, no, no, we don't have
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.040]   them yet.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.040]   But they did give out rain checks.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.720]   So they must have something coming.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.560]   But do you want $150 tablet?
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.120]   What the hell could be in that thing?
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.360]   Dude, you made $100 for your exo.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:40.960]   And I'm sorry, but I, you know, the one that Apple jiggered me for.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.760]   No, no, the arm.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   Arm.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.240]   An arm process is going to be running Android and it's just going to have the same app as
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   everybody else has.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   I don't know.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.160]   It's probably the only thing that would make it a cheap piece of crap seems to me would
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.040]   be the screen itself if it doesn't have the right sensitivity in the rest of it.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.960]   I wonder, though, I mean, really seriously, how much hardware could you put in that for
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   that price?
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:06.240]   Because, because, well, doesn't target take say half is Kmart or Kmart.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:10.560]   This is according to the big gem again, who is now running the show from the chat room.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.600]   The advice is out now and in gadget gives it a decent take.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   Wow.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.520]   I haven't been able to watch the video yet.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.000]   They're nine minute videos each.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.920]   I didn't have time to pre we've been waiting for Android tablets.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.200]   I mean, I really think Android tablets are going to be a compelling choice.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.520]   You were just telling me, Brian, that, oh my God, Chad.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   Oh, I'm G.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520]   Oh, I'm G.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.520]   Oh my God, Chad.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   Oh my God.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.520]   Oh my God.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.520]   I'm going to start calling you.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   Oh my God.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   Chad.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   Yeah, that'll work.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.440]   I'm just glad it's not WTF, Chad, but OMG, Chad said that sold you his iPad because he's
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   dyslexic.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   Well, I got it.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.640]   I got it for a steal for like 350 bucks because he bought the 499 version and it was
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.640]   an open box.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.760]   So he even got a discount off of that.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.920]   But he and he is hardcore Mac fanboy, but you know, he has dyslexia, but he's super smart
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.520]   and he figured out ways to work around it.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   The ways he works around it is on his Android phone.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.960]   He loves the speech to text.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   So it does all his editing.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.320]   So it's a real big selling point right now.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.400]   And on his laptop, he always uses the robot voice to read like big blocks of paragraph
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.800]   or reads it at double speed.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.520]   So he's able to work around his dyslexia just fine.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.320]   But then on iPad, he couldn't do either of those and it was too frustrating and too slow.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.000]   And he begrudgingly said, I'm going to get rid of it.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.040]   So I got a steal on it.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.200]   Felicia, you are a Kindle fan.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Yes?
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   I am.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.480]   Although I do have an iPad as well.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.480]   So.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   Oh, do you?
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.200]   Do you read Kindle books on the iPad?
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.600]   You know, I love the, I do, but I honestly have a problem.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.280]   I feel like it's a lot easier to read on the Kindle screen as far as going to bed.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   That's not a problem.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   You're right.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   But everything else.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.280]   I mean, I love it.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.280]   I think it's a.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   Is it the weight or is it the light that bothers you?
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   It's the backlight.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.800]   It gives me like really dry eyes.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.960]   I noticed if I wake up the next morning and I'm reading a book on that versus being able
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:58.440]   to read, and I also read more like a page versus like skimming a website.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.760]   I noticed myself skimming more if I'm reading a book on the Kindle.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.960]   Well, that's what this funny because that's the ironic thing is I always thought the Kindle
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.440]   was bad for skimming is good for very linear reading, but bad for newspapers or anything
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.440]   you would want to scan.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.680]   So, but you think it's better for scanning.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:17.160]   I mean, I feel like my eye jumps a lot more and I mean, I just enjoy it.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.680]   I feel like I retain a lot more if I read it on the Kindle just because it's just more
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.000]   gentle on my eyes, but that just could be me.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.560]   I mean, I love my iPad for pretty much everything else.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.200]   I bet on the Kindle feels closer to a real book for those who are into the book reading
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.720]   experience, I could totally understand.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.520]   Should we talk about the low price Kindle?
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.760]   That's the good news.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.000]   Kindle sales have been through the roof.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.440]   They're saying since they dropped the Kindle price to 189, right?
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.080]   That's what it went down to, right?
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.080]   189.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   139 for Wi-Fi only.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   The new one.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   189 for 3G.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.480]   They're $139, but they were saying when the first price drops to 189 for the 3G, they
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.640]   have to be in a race for that magic $99 moment where if they can hit that number and especially
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.800]   if they can get to the point where you could join a book of the month club and get a Kindle
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.680]   for free, then it becomes like the book to read things, the object to read books on.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.160]   Wasn't though that what we were debating was what is the cost of the Kindle to make?
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.160]   And would they be able to sell it that cheaply?
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.520]   And I guess that's the answer is that even if they're losing money at 139 bucks, they
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.800]   make money on the books.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.160]   And at this point, they're in a fight to the death with Apple.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.840]   Well, it seems like no.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.000]   And no, you don't think so?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.160]   Nah.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   I don't think there's, I mean, you know, it's like I did the last cranky geeks a week or
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.280]   so ago with this one of our tech guys who owns everything.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.960]   And it was about the Kmart thing.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.000]   I realized that there's a bunch of people out there.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.280]   It's not like I was zero sum game with this gear.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.160]   He says, Oh yeah, no, I've got an iPad, but I'm going to get that Kmart 159 thing.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   Right.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   He's going to have two or three of these.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.160]   They have both perfect.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.760]   Oh, no, no, no, no, nobody's as extreme as you are.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.960]   Yeah, I don't think I'm a good example.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   This is my business.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.240]   But you're close enough to it.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.000]   I mean, if it wasn't your business, you'd still have a couple of more devices than the
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.760]   one loan device.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.040]   And so I think a lot of iPad users will have a Kindle.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   Why not?
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.800]   So the new ones only eight ounces or so is really light.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.440]   They iPad users will get a Kindle if it's 99 bucks.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.720]   Well, not even price.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   But if the Kindle does exactly one thing and does it better than anyone else, iPad is just
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.320]   a device because it does a million things.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.800]   And yes, you can read books using the Kindle app on an iPad.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   But what Kindle needs to do is not add any more functionality and needs to focus on being
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.840]   slimmer and lighter and more durable and cheaper.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.040]   And once it does it, it wins the branding battle.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.520]   And when I say electronic books, only one word comes to your mind and that's Kindle.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.560]   And I would add to that, first of all, brilliant analysis should I love your baritone.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.560]   Really?
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.560]   It was.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.560]   There's no more words to be said about this.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.520]   But I will add words because I do love the sound of my voice.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.400]   It's just the analogy to camera phones versus digital cameras is great.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.080]   I mean, for many people, the camera phone is becoming good enough and even more than
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.760]   good enough with being able to shoot HD video.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.920]   But there's still people who carry dedicated Canon or Kodak or whatever they have because
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.120]   they want a device that nails one function really well.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:15.440]   So your list of things that Amazon needs to do is also keep their catalog the best possible
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.360]   largest, most diverse catalog out there because there's so many books in the Kindle library
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.760]   that are not yet available in the iPhone.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.160]   Yeah, so frustrating.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.200]   If you, if I want to discover a new series and they have number three on the Kindle and
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.080]   not number one and two, and I generally, I basically won't read that series because I'm
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.600]   like, guys, have the first one at least.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.200]   And then maybe I'll be more inclined if I really love the book to buy a physical copy
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.200]   of the third one.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.080]   But if I don't have the first one right there at my fingertips, I'm probably going to just
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.080]   forget.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.560]   And the problem with it is also if you request something on Kindle, I feel like Amazon should
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.840]   like collect those or you should be able to save it.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.840]   There's no feedback loop there.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.480]   So they'll tell you what it's actually available.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.800]   You know, actually they do something very smart in a lot of cases where there's a trilogy.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.440]   They give away the first book on the trilogy knowing that you're going to be buying two
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   and three.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   Wow, that's very clever.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   Isn't that smart?
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   I didn't even know they did that.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   And I have two more books on it.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   I have one book that I'm going to be doing.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.440]   I'm going to be doing it.

[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   I'm going to be doing it.

[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.440]   I'm going to be doing it.

[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   I'm going to be doing it.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.440]   I'm going to put it out for $9.99 and see what happens.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   It's a professional's guide to fire eating on Kindle.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.440]   I finally bought it myself on my iPad.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   I was a little disappointed because the PDF formatting is all jacked up.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   I'm trying to fix that.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.440]   For the moment, limited time, I'm going to have it up there for $10 and see what happens.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.440]   I think it's just so very well.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   It's the hobby I need to take up.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   What are the device, John?
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   The kindling.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.440]   Never mind.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.440]   Joe, Joe.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   I like it.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   The kindling.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.440]   The fire.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.440]   It's a fire.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.440]   You put it on the Kindle.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.440]   I thought that was good, John.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.440]   I liked it.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:22.440]   Who would buy a Wi-Fi only version versus the 50 bucks more for 3G?
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.440]   Should everybody just buy the Wi-Fi?
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.440]   It's not like you're...
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.880]   I mean, when I buy a book, you take time to read a book and on the Kindle, you're going
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.440]   to have four or five books loaded at any time.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.440]   It's not like you're going to be at the beach and I'm like, "Oh, I need this book and I
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   need it right now."
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   I do that all the time.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   Do you really?
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.440]   If I'm reading a series, I'll go through a four or five book series in a week.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.440]   So I'll be like, "Yeah."
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.440]   So you need 3G.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.440]   And you know what?
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.440]   I use it at the...
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.100]   It's not that you're going to use 3G a lot, but it's those unpredictable moments when
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.740]   you just finish a book.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.320]   You can't predict where you're going to be and if Wi-Fi is going to be available at
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   that point.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.040]   So you could try to build cues in these discrete moments.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.040]   "Okay, I'm at home.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.720]   I'm going to do my book shopping before I leave town for the weekend or go on this flight
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.720]   or whatever."
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.720]   Also, yeah.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.720]   So I'm like, "I'm at home.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.720]   I'm at home.

[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   I'm at home.

[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   I'm at home.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   I'm at home.

[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.720]   It detected Japanese.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.720]   Google Translate says...
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.720]   It's going to be a disaster.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.720]   It's going to be huge.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   This is history in the making.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.720]   That the minutes uncovered may come later.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.720]   What?
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.720]   With gosoto.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.720]   With gosoto.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.720]   Kind of deep.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.720]   It's the high cougher.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.720]   It's uncovered may come later.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.720]   That the minutes uncovered may come later.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.720]   That would probably be the great billionth tweet.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.720]   I'll get back to you.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.720]   That's the billionth tweet.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:15.720]   It's the 20 for us trying to uncover the hidden meaning of that message.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.720]   You know what Google does in Nice Job Reading this?
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:18.720]   Let's just listen for a moment.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.720]   That's the minutes uncovered.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.720]   May come later.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.720]   W.Gosoto.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.720]   Now, here's the...
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.520]   I get the press release for the first billionth tweet.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.520]   I get the press release for the 10th billionth tweet.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.520]   But the 28th billionth tweet?
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.520]   No, 20th.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.520]   20th billionth.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.520]   Oh, it's a big number.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520]   G20.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.520]   I'd say take it easy till 100.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.520]   Get back to me at 100.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520]   PC Magazine's done the...
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.520]   PC Magazine is so on.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   I'm press, Brian.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   It's easy to press.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.520]   The graphic designer...
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.520]   PC Magazine's done the research.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.520]   They say it's a graphic designer in Tokyo.
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:54.520]   They say the translation is...
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.520]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.520]   The translated response to the news is...
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.520]   It looks like I posted the 20 billionth tweet.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.520]   I'm getting replies from people all over the world.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.520]   It's scary.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520]   What are the chances?
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.520]   Maybe I'm going to die.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.520]   It is more amazing than winning the lottery.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.520]   I thought this was a joke.
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.520]   Boy, Japanese is really a concise language.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.520]   That's 140 characters.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.520]   No, wait a minute.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.520]   All that in there?
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.520]   It's fair.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.520]   It is kind of cool that the feature 20 billionth tweet was not in English.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.520]   And, you know, Twitter and all these tools, we're obviously English speakers.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.520]   We live in the USA.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:26.520]   But it's easy to forget when you don't see and understand other languages that there's...
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:33.520]   Literally another world of people out there using, defining, editing and tweaking these tools for their own purposes.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:39.520]   And not that this is the best example of that, but the fact that it's not in English I think is pretty cool's coincidental stance.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   I don't know, but I think we're very close, if not already there, that more tweets are coming from non-English speakers and English speakers.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.520]   Chatroom is saying that the W at the end doesn't mean with.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.520]   We read it as...
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.520]   Or I read it as with, but that's LOL is how the Japanese use it.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:53.520]   Really?
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.520]   W means LOL.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.520]   That's what they're saying in the chat room.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.520]   Hmm.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.520]   Huh.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.520]   Well, you learn something every day.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.520]   Hopefully.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.520]   So I got something for you here, Leo.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.520]   Yes.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520]   It's just monotonous.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   There it is.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.520]   Oh, bottle of Chateau L'Aoveil.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.520]   Guess why John is holding that bottle?
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.520]   What is that?
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.520]   That is a fine bordeaux.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.520]   One of the best bordeaux in France, right, John?
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.520]   He's spent a little bit of...
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520]   It's pricey.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.520]   He's spent a little bit of money on the pocket chains.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.520]   It's, you know, it's beside the point.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   He was going to give it to me.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.520]   I said, "Well, you're going to get it."
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.520]   Yeah, sure.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.520]   No.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.520]   Why am I going to get that, John?
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.520]   Why exactly would I get that?
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:41.520]   So you could lord it over me regarding the bet we made that I apparently will lose shortly.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.520]   I'm actually embarrassed that I made that bet to be honest.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520]   What was the bet?
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520]   I was out of this.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:52.520]   So, and I made a bet for 100 bucks with somebody in the chat room I thought, but this was in January of this year when the iPad was first announced.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.520]   I said, "This is going to be huge.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.520]   They will easily sell $5 million in the first year."
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.520]   And everybody said, "Oh, you're crazy.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.520]   There's no way."
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.520]   John even said, "I'll bet you a bottle of the best bordeaux in this guy."
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.520]   Well, any Leo, because it's your name.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.520]   Leo, right.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.520]   Why do you actually own the place I think?
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.520]   I do.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.520]   So you've actually doubly rewarded me.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.520]   So, is he going to drink it now for you or is he going to send it over?
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.520]   Yeah, John's going to drink it for him.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520]   We did that, John.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.520]   Why don't you just drink that?
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.520]   It's like a sour.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.520]   It's a poor sport.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520]   It starts guzzling it.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.520]   It's your wine and I'm drinking it.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520]   Take that, LePart!
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   Yes.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520]   You're going down.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.520]   MBE is the chatter who owes me $100.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.520]   Actually, not yet, because it hasn't sold $5 million.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.520]   Sales could suddenly just stop.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.520]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.520]   Yeah, that's going to happen.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:43.520]   In a way, I'm not thrilled about it, to be honest, because I think in some ways it's a regressive device.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.520]   As much as, you know, I think it's a great device.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.520]   It is not a content creation device.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.520]   No, but what it does is it opens up.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.520]   It opens up.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.520]   It opens up.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:57.520]   It's the other thing I said, which is that people should not think of this as a computer.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.520]   It is for consuming, not for creating.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.520]   It very much is not a computer, but you're right.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:06.320]   I didn't think I'd like it because it is content creation or content consumption only, but it opens
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:11.520]   up several places to consume content that I've never experienced before, like at the gym.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.520]   Have you, do you like a flip book?
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.520]   Have you played with flip book?
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.520]   Love, love, love, love.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.520]   Oh, yeah, that thing is great.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:20.520]   Oh, I have some comments about flip board.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520]   Flip board, yeah.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.120]   So here's, I want to, I have to throw this in because I have not yet read much criticism
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.520]   of some pretty outlandish statements that their president or CEO has been saying.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.160]   So they do this really cool thing with your tweets and your Facebooks to make it visually
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.640]   stimulating and pull the pictures.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:44.440]   But what they're doing with publisher content seems very like 1990s scraping, republishing
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.160]   stuff that I thought we had sort of moved past in the Asian internet.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.520]   So they're taking not just RSS feed, but I think using readability to pull multiple
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.480]   paragraphs of content and sort of restyling people's stuff.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:00.440]   And what he says the president is that they're going to sell ads against this and then share
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.440]   that ad revenue with publishers.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.440]   Oh, thanks.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:09.960]   And he able to do so at 10 times the rate publishers can get on their own, which I believe is based
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.640]   on nothing.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.280]   And I haven't been able to find any publishers who can say like, oh yeah, we've been talking
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.320]   to Flipbook and they've proven they can get like they haven't sold a single ad yet as
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.320]   far as I know.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.320]   So I just, I don't know how you can make big statements in a chronic, technical article
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.360]   about how you can sell at 10 times the rate.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.840]   You know, when you have to free that layout that you just had there with all those different
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.440]   pages would be great for chat roulette, don't you think?
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.400]   So what this is, it's a, it's actually a Twitter scraper.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.560]   So what it does first, you sign into your Twitter or Facebook account.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:44.080]   What it does first is it gets your Twitter feed and then it gets all the articles linked
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.520]   within the feed and creates a magazine out of it.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.400]   And if you want to read more, they say we're only putting as much material in this as the
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.800]   RSS would we're not putting even though it is scraped.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800]   And that's true.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.800]   And that's not true.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   I agree.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.000]   If you look at the, the canonical example is the big photo, the Boston Globe's incredible
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.520]   photo page.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:06.240]   It includes the full versions of the photo, which you cannot get on.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.680]   But I will say there's a number of articles that I started reading and I always, if the
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:13.720]   article engages, engages me, click through to the actual website.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.480]   And so I'm sure there's got to be some haggling over the, you know, who gets what.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.480]   There's no ads.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.400]   There's no ads until you go to the full website.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.360]   And you do get the full picture here.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.840]   It's, it's a means, look, nobody can argue it's a beautiful presentation, right?
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.840]   Maritan?
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.080]   No, I, I, well, here's what, I mean, I, I'm pro net pro open access to things, but it's
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:39.600]   been really interesting being on the, on the producer side, when I'm with this media organization.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:45.880]   And I, and just the idea of we're going to redirect, you know, existing views and take
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.800]   them to this ad free environment that not just ad free, but they changed the design.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:54.360]   You know, people put a lot of thought and time into how they want their stuff to look.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:59.080]   And you're going to manipulate that claim and then claim you're doing them a favor.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080]   That's, it just seems a little.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.080]   That's the tech route.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.360]   And you, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the tech route.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.360]   And then you, that's the tech route.
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:29.040]   And, and, and, and what the focus is, is on beauty of presentation, and less so on content
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.040]   itself.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.680]   And it does worry me just a little bit.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:37.160]   I have to say, now I'm a big fan of Hacker News, the Y Combinator news feed, which in
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.200]   its feed only gives you the headline.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.520]   So already this is giving you far more than the headline.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.960]   Now they say they honor, they honor robot.text.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:49.880]   So if, if, if Hacker News wanted to use robots.text, I guess it would be honored, although I'm
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   not sure.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.480]   And what he says in, in these interviews, and this is one extended interview in the San
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:59.040]   Francisco Chronicle I'm referring to is, any publisher who was unhappy with the way
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:04.360]   in which we are, you know, using and presenting their content can contact us and tell us what
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:05.600]   they'd be happy or with.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.600]   Right.
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.520]   Which I think, again, it's just a weird way to do business.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.520]   It's like, I'm going to take your stuff.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.520]   And then you can, yeah.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.920]   If you're unhappy with what I've done with your stuff, then it's on you to come tell me
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.080]   what you prefer.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.840]   I have to say, if they did this with my, my podcast, I'd be furious.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:22.680]   Because we, we'd lose money basically by this.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:26.600]   But here's what, here's what I do like about like the, the consumer, the reader, the visual
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.600]   person.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.080]   It's, it's inspiring.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:32.040]   And it does show you another way to do things.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:36.800]   So well, and it's a nice measure because this is the article and you have the Twitter
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.040]   content that's associated with it.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.040]   And I really haven't seen anything quite, you know, even though it kind of normalizes
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:47.000]   the reading experience across different brands outside of whatever their design direction
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.800]   is, it's beautiful to a large degree.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.480]   And it's, it is simple and it kind of creates its own navigation.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.640]   That's really exciting from a design.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:59.000]   This thing is so illegal.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   It's ridiculous.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.080]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.080]   You know what?
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.880]   This is, this is just the second iteration.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.320]   This is a new dance, a new iteration of the same dance that YouTube did.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.320]   YouTube launched.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320]   It was a great idea.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320]   It was the right implementation.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.200]   Unfortunately, it was filled with pirated content.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.480]   But once it grew, grew to prominence, they were able to work things out.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.520]   Now we have a sensible system that works as far as revenue sharing.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.560]   People could put music inside their, their videos.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.560]   I'm sure they're going to have this out.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.000]   We want to make five cents from any of this stuff.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.880]   These guys are going to get sued to death.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:30.360]   Well Dave, this is an article in mind that you're showing right here from The Economist.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:34.680]   And they somehow put some advertising revenue about this case has already been settled.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:41.280]   It was done years ago with that news site that used frames around the outside of regular
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.280]   newspaper articles.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.280]   They got sued.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.880]   I think, Brian, your point about YouTube is interesting, but YouTube, the onus was, it
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:52.520]   wasn't YouTube itself putting content into the YouTube system.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.520]   Right.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.520]   There you go.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:55.520]   That's a million of users.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:59.000]   This case, this is a corporate entity called Flipbook with $10 million of VC funding.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000]   Yeah, that's fair.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.600]   It has 15 employees who are actually hand doing this.
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.720]   What if YouTube, what if YouTube has said, oh, we're going to get all your videos and
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.280]   we're going to put them all on our site and if we make any money, we'll give you some.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.280]   Well, it'd be over.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.280]   You're right.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:17.280]   But it's, I still feel like this is a case where eventually everyone's going to make
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:20.560]   a lot of noise and then eventually two people sit down on the table and some kind of revenue
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:24.280]   share that makes everybody happy or relatively happy will be worked out.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.280]   I'm really curious about wishful thinking.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.280]   It's kind of worse.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.640]   It's kind of not to be sued out of existence.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.360]   It's kind of what Dave Weiner said should happen.
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:38.480]   Actually, I thought that the father of RSS might have something more serious to say about
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:39.480]   this.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.000]   And in fact, on his blog post, he said, well, you know, I'm tempted to say this is, you know,
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.280]   horrible and this is violating the tenets of RSS and said what I'd like to say is we
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:53.000]   got to work to make a kind of RSS or a way of signaling from a publisher how they'd like
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.720]   to be included or whether they don't want to be included at all in a compilation like
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:57.720]   this.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:02.280]   But to me, the reason I bring it, I think it's very appropriate as we talk about the five
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:06.800]   million thi pad being sold in the next month or so.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:11.040]   This is what, to me, this is what happens with the iPad is you become very focused on
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.160]   the beauty of it, not where the source is.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.280]   And frankly, as I'm reading the economist, yeah, I can push a button that says read the
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.040]   rest of the article, but three paragraphs in, that's enough.
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.040]   I'm moving on.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.040]   Not me.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.040]   I keep going.
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.040]   I always look on the re-man that I know.
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040]   No, no, I'm a sadder man than you.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.320]   I think web analytics improve you.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.680]   You're a rare reader to actually read the full story.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.440]   And just everybody in the chat room keeps saying this is just an RSS feed.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:36.240]   It is most definitely absolutely not an RSS feed.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.240]   It's a scrape.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.280]   As the operator of some RSS feeds that are in this app, I can guarantee you it's not the
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.280]   case.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.640]   And you can see that from others, the images, the multiple paragraphs, they're using some
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:48.600]   kind of extra scraping, which again, I think is based on readability, which is a really
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.680]   cool web plugin.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.000]   But it's not just RSS.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.920]   So that's kind of the part of the issue.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.440]   The guy who made the question of the legal.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:01.480]   The guy who started this started telling me, and he sold to Microsoft for a lot of money.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:06.120]   So it's, you know, this is, this is what comes up for me when I see the iPad as much as I
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:10.520]   like the iPad and as much as I knew it was going to be a success, I worry a lot about
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:14.960]   what it does to turn us back into takers instead of makers.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:15.960]   Hmm.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.200]   I wonder if you couldn't.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.200]   Grimes.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.200]   Yeah, I like rhymes.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.240]   I'm the Jesse Jackson of white people.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.240]   Let me refer you to.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.240]   You can write a mirror two days out.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.240]   No, no, no.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.240]   I was just kidding.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:29.240]   I was kidding.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.240]   Oh, the key.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240]   Not only.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:37.640]   I thought that was one of the chapters in his book.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:41.160]   You're breaking my heart.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.920]   You're just inspiring more chapters.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.920]   I know.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.920]   I know.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.920]   I don't know.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.360]   I think it's kind of delightful that we've hit this.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.360]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   What are you doing?
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.360]   You don't.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.360]   Oh my God.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.360]   What are you doing?
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.360]   No, I thought you changed it.
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.360]   Are you bad?
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:57.360]   I thought you changed it.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.920]   I thought you changed it.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:06.480]   I really shouldn't name it.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.000]   The show should not be named that.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.400]   No, not at all.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.400]   Thank you.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.400]   I'm so sorry.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.400]   I thought you changed it.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.400]   I thought it didn't matter anymore.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.240]   But people could possibly find back.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:16.240]   It's the Internet.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.240]   I'm so sorry.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:19.520]   She's going to be tracked.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.120]   I'd like to right now.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.880]   I'd like to apologize to Baratunde Thurston to Felicia Day.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:25.880]   No, I apologize.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:26.880]   It just makes it worse.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.880]   Don't apologize to me.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.480]   Don't apologize to me.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:36.040]   I'm now retiring as president of the Internet.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.040]   Audible.com.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:42.680]   Let's get another ad in here before we get taken off the air entirely.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.680]   Audible.com/twit to Felicia.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.400]   I know you read a lot of books.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.240]   But do you ever consider Audible audio books?
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:56.760]   The only thing I'm more of a visual reader, but the one thing that I do enjoy audio-wise
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.760]   is language tapes.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.040]   That's the only way I take to learn.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:01.040]   It's a good way to learn.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:01.840]   They have those actually.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:02.840]   Unaudible.com.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:10.000]   Audible is a great bookstore of audio books, 75,000 and growing all the time.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.120]   In fact, Baratunde, I hope your book will be unaudible.com.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.760]   Yeah, we're definitely working on the audio part.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.160]   I hope to be reading it myself and that was one of the things I was most excited about.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.800]   I've been listening to audio books since ninth grade and a big, big, big fan.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.800]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:27.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:29.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:33.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:34.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:36.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:38.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:41.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:42.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:44.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:45.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:48.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:49.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:51.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:52.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:54.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:55.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:57.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:58.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:35:59.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.800]   I'm not sure.
