[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.680]   no other compact car is more fuel efficient.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.960]   A fuel economy is just for starters.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.840]   The 2011 Ford Fiesta, we invite you to drive one this week
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.040]   at a Ford dealer near you.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.040]   And by the Eco-Majination Challenge from GE.

[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.960]   It's time for Tuit this week in--
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.400]   Tuit!
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.720]   What is-- oh, technology!
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.240]   Joining us, we're so glad to have a live all-in studio
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.080]   cast today, starting with the star of this week in Google,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.280]   the author of What Would Google Do and a Professor
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.080]   of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.280]   You know by now I'm talking about Jeff Jarvis at Buzz
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.800]   Mission.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.440]   I'm happy to finally be in Tuit College.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.080]   It's so nice to have you.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.840]   It's a wonderful place.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.280]   It's great.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.760]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.000]   And you're out here for a conference?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.760]   The PII 2010 conference in Seattle for privacy and stuff.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.320]   Post-intelligent, sir?
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.160]   Dope.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.720]   Personally, that of public information is the joke.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   Oh, I like it.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.320]   I like it.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.240]   And you're of course writing a book called Public Parts.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.760]   So that's appropriate for you.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.320]   And one of his most public achievements is his son, Jake
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.520]   Jarvis, who is also in studio with us.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.600]   In fact, this is your last appearance
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.160]   before you enter college.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.000]   How exciting.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.520]   I know.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.360]   Where are you going?
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.240]   I don't know if you want to reveal it or not.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.040]   Is Jake as public as you are, Jeff?
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.640]   No one's as public as I am.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.560]   He has to bear with me.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.760]   University of Rochester.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   Congratulations.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.320]   How exciting.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.760]   When do you matriculate?
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.840]   25th, we go up there and class will start about a week later.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.760]   How exciting.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.120]   How fun.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.000]   Are you nervous?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.600]   Are you?
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.080]   A little bit.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.000]   Ready, though.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.520]   We dropped my daughter off.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   Her freshman year has already started on Saturday.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.720]   And we were balling our eyes out.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.120]   Jeff, you're over.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.640]   Once.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.200]   One brief, one brief, happy email.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.040]   I know she's happy.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.080]   Oh, she's still unpacking.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.440]   That's all I care about.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.120]   Well, she wouldn't let us unpack for her.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.280]   So yeah, you're probably right.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.720]   She probably has an unpack.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.200]   That's Denise Howell.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.640]   It was also a mom, but her son is only six and a half.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.920]   So you got a few years left.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.440]   Goes by fast, though, doesn't it?
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.080]   It does.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.720]   Faster than you mean.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.200]   Save up now.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   That's a bad mention.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.520]   Denise is an attorney.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.560]   She is our host of this week in law.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.920]   A great show on the Google network.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.160]   If only.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.560]   On the Twitter network.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.560]   Which you did every Friday.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.480]   You were buying the token app.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.680]   Yeah, no, I'm not for sale.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.280]   They're evil.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.840]   We're talking about that in a second.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.200]   Denise also is a blogger at bagandbagage.com
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.000]   and writes the Logarithms blog for ZDNet.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.960]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.480]   Great to be here.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.120]   And you're here for family.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.840]   Here for family.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.440]   Just take it away.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.880]   And to see the animals at Safari West.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.760]   Yes, Safari West just up the road.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.440]   That's really fun.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.520]   We brought the kids there every year.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.240]   It's great.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.000]   They have wild animal park.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.080]   Did you know there's a wild animal park in that alumna?
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.360]   It's just chickens and cows, but it's really great.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.280]   It's really great.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.560]   So thanks to everybody for being in studio with us.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.360]   We have quite a large in studio audience of people
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.440]   from all over the country and the world visiting.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.040]   And of course, everybody at home was watching at live.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.840]   Twit.tv.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.640]   We watched the chatroom as the show goes by.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.440]   And if you have thoughts or questions,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   you're always welcome to contribute them.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.240]   I'll be glad to ignore them at irc.twit.tv.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.440]   This is episode 261.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.680]   So our stories are online at delicious.com/twit/261.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.720]   And I guess we have to talk about really
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.320]   the biggest story of the week.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.080]   There's actually now some additional stuff around it.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.400]   Oracle suing Google.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.240]   Google does a deal with Verizon.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.400]   There was a great tweet, a guy named, I think, Phil Nash
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.760]   posted a tweet which I retweeted.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.960]   And I think I'm getting credit for it.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.640]   And I really shouldn't get credit for it
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.000]   because it wasn't my idea.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.960]   But I did retweet him.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.360]   And unfortunately, the way retweeting seems to work on Twitter,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.280]   sometimes you get credit for stuff
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.080]   that you post, even though you're just retweeting.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.160]   You lose the provenance.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.280]   The provenance got--
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.160]   so I want to say his name.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   And I'm going to read his tweet, which I really liked
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.200]   if I could find it here.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.840]   Of course, it's been retweeted a bunch.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.720]   "Welcome to the new decades," said Phil Nash.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.160]   Java is a restricted platform.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.480]   Google is evil, Apple is a monopoly,
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.800]   and Microsoft are the underdogs.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.840]   It's kind of is true, isn't it?
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.840]   We were thinking on this week in Google
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.200]   when we talked about the Google Verizon deal that maybe
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.960]   Bing was the place to go to hide from Google.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.640]   So let's start with this Google Verizon thing.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.760]   First of all, maybe I should ask Denise.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.400]   Google said this isn't an agreement.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.120]   This is just a proposal for legislation.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.280]   What's the story?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.640]   Right.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.200]   And I think it's even more removed than that.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.120]   It's sort of--
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.120]   And--
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.480]   It's not an operating agreement.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.120]   It's not something they've agreed to do together.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.640]   No, no, no.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.360]   They got together and they decided--
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.000]   And kudos to Google for actually taking a stand on an issue
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.600]   and taking it to Washington, which
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.680]   is something that people complain about a lot,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.320]   that there are technology companies that
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.200]   are involved in issues that touch all of our lives every day.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.040]   And their users certainly care a lot about these issues.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   But sometimes they just let those issues go by
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.160]   and don't do any lobbying.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.400]   So I think of this as kind of like a lobbying effort.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.080]   They got together.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   They put together a policy statement.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.800]   And they took it to Washington.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.840]   It's a little bit like writing a letter to your congressman.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.800]   Well, it's also stepping into a policy vacuum, I think.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.080]   Yes.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.840]   Which is what Susan Crawford has said in her blog
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.960]   and in a guest post, I think, for Giga Home,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.040]   that the FCC should grow a pair and step into this.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.480]   And the problem is that they haven't.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.600]   And that's why Google and Verizon kind of step out and say,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.800]   oh, Google should look like this.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.280]   Yes.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.880]   The sad part is why the hell Google made this deal.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.560]   I still just baffles me.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.200]   Well, Google was one of those companies that says,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.800]   we'll never work with Verizon.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.400]   We don't believe in limiting your internet access.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.800]   We don't believe that companies like Verizon who
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.840]   want to do things-- well, remember the Wired magazine
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.080]   article where AT&T went to Apple saying,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.720]   could you please limit those YouTube videos to 10 seconds?
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.320]   Because it's killing our network.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.120]   You would think Google would be the first one
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.600]   to say that's a bad idea.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   Well, Google, who says customer first, in nothing
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.120]   and this is thinking like us, what we want and Google
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   should want because it is aligned with our interests,
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.360]   is a hugely open, free internet wherever you get it.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.280]   And to limit that, I wrote a post on Buzz machine
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.880]   about internet, Schmidt-er-net.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.320]   And we have the internet now.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.000]   And then the Schmidt-er-net is where everything good
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.600]   is going to happen.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   And that's going to cost more money.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   And that's going to be limited.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.000]   And that's going to be censored by phone companies.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.160]   And that's no good.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.000]   And that's why everyone is so distressed that Google
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.080]   would go along with us.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.880]   Well, the Nexus was their attempt to open this.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.840]   And then they got rid of it because the phone companies,
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.800]   so they were going there.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.960]   And then they suddenly started back pedaling.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.600]   2006, this is Google's public service in that story.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.120]   If I had to make a better internet--
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.840]   If I had to make a better internet--
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.800]   If I had to make a better internet, I'd make it smaller.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.560]   I don't trust these kids in the crazy startup ideas.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.640]   I don't trust these kids with their crazy startup ideas.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.200]   Look.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.600]   I can't deal with all these web pages.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.000]   Enough with all these internet videos.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.280]   If I want to watch a movie, I'll just go to the movies.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.880]   What the internet needs?
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.080]   More restrictions.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.200]   More restrictions.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.800]   More restrictions.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.760]   Why should I be able to surf wherever I want?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.320]   Who needs a gazillion sights?
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.600]   Can someone please just block my favorite sights?
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.360]   I don't care what music I listen to.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.000]   I want someone to choose for me.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.360]   I want someone to choose it for me.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.960]   Let's leave the internet with the big corporations
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.280]   where it belongs.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.280]   Then it says the new internet.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.440]   If AT&T and Verizon have their way,
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.080]   this is an ad that Google made save the internet,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.280]   support net neutrality.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.800]   I think isn't Jake right that this is about Android.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.760]   This is about phones.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.920]   Google's now in the phone business.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.400]   Is it greed?
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.360]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.080]   What's in it for them?
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.760]   What's in it for them?
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.680]   Well, Google says-- and we will get--
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.520]   I apologize to all my friends at Google,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.320]   including Chris Tobona, who did send us an email saying,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.480]   I'd love to come on and talk.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.240]   We did ask Google public relations to come on this weekend.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.920]   And we will get somebody on this weekend, Google, on Wednesday.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.200]   And maybe it'll be Chris Tobona.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.960]   So I will give Google a chance to say,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.400]   but they in their blog this week,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.920]   they responded to all the criticism saying,
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.000]   well, it was the best we could do.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.920]   It was the best we could get.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.600]   We had to get something.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.480]   So we said, OK, we'll protect the landline internet
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.320]   with net neutrality.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   And that's in fact what this agreement says.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.120]   OK, landlines, no problem.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.200]   Net neutrality rules.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.000]   But if you're wireless, you could do whatever
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.240]   you want, because it's so much harder on wireless
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.120]   to do good internet.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.800]   So is this true?
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.880]   Is this the all at Google?
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.320]   Again, did they get a concession that's about?
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.560]   Why does Google give themselves the position?
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.520]   Do they think it's up to them to negotiate this?
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.440]   When China came along, they said, oh, no, no, we're not
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.920]   a country.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.440]   We don't really want to be in this position.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.240]   And now they set themselves up to negotiate with Verizon
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.000]   and not on our interest.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.840]   So does this-- it doesn't have any impact of law.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.240]   It's not an operating agreement.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.360]   It's not a business agreement with Verizon.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.720]   It's just two companies who are hereditary enemies getting
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.200]   together and saying to Congress, this is what you should do.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   But doesn't that have a lot of weight, especially if it's
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.040]   Google and two enemies saying this?
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.960]   It's very educational, I think, for the people in Washington.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.320]   In a lot of instances, this is going
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.000]   to be their talking points, their bullets on--
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.080]   Well, that's scary.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.520]   Yeah, and that is a little bit scary.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.480]   Their reaction is going to be what any ignorant, normal person
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.200]   would say, well, it's Google and Verizon.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.960]   It must be the way it should be.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.520]   Right.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.040]   Oh, hey.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.560]   Oh, hey.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.040]   Right.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.600]   And there needs to be some definition and texture
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.840]   around what the internet becomes next,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.320]   because the world where we all had a desktop and a landline
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.520]   has gone away.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.080]   Right.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.880]   And--
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.520]   The internet is wireless, for many of us.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.120]   That'll be entirely wireless, including Google itself
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.960]   fought for white spaces to become Wi-Fi on steroids.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.200]   And that would give us what we really need, which
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.120]   is competition.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.200]   For Google to say that there is competition and wireless,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.120]   it's just ridiculous.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.240]   We don't have competition.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.680]   They were stuck with 2.2 bad choices.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.280]   Right.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.800]   So what should we--
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.160]   as consumers, what should we fight for at this point?
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.720]   Should we say--
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.360]   I mean, obviously, the answer to this
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   is simple, just write to your member of Congress
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.000]   and say, well, that's Google and Verizon,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.400]   but we don't agree, as users of the internet, the internet
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:51.840]   should--
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.560]   I always-- I hate the phrase net neutrality.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.680]   I think that confuses people.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.800]   I would say anti-discrimination.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.880]   Because that's really what we're saying is that a bit is a bit.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.880]   No bit on the internet should be treated differently
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.560]   than any other bit of--
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.200]   Open competitive, capitalistic internet.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:08.460]   I see.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.680]   I like that because Congress likes
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.320]   that open, capitalistic, competitive--
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.600]   That's what we're talking about here.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.800]   You're saying a free market on the internet.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.760]   Yes, a free market internet.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.320]   So that's good.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.600]   Congress likes free market.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.000]   That's a safe thing to say.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.680]   I think we need you to organize the constitutional
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   convention of the internet.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.680]   Well, this is the irony.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.840]   That PSA that I ran, that public service announcement,
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.760]   was for a site called SaveTheInternet.org.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.120]   And Google got behind it.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.160]   And the whole idea of SaveTheInternet.org
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.080]   was to fight these anti-open initiatives.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.600]   People like Verizon and Comcast, who were saying, well,
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.640]   the internet's OK as long as you don't use Skype or BitTorrent
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.680]   on it.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.800]   You better not try that.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.920]   So, Jake, are you saying that it's greed, basically,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.080]   that now that they are effectively
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.800]   in bed with Verizon over Android phones
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.240]   and every other cell phone company,
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.520]   that they're interests coincide with the wireless companies
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.240]   interests?
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.680]   I guess it's just I don't understand
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.680]   why they feel the need to step in and be the big bully about this.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.240]   I don't think the backfire is worth it for them.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.440]   Well, they certainly get in a lot of backlash.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.440]   Right.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.680]   That's clear.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.160]   Do you think they underestimated Jeff what
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.880]   the response would be?
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.680]   Or do they even care?
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.120]   God, that is scary if they don't care.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.880]   Do they need to care?
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.720]   Why do they need to care?
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.080]   They care in the past.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.640]   But you know, look at it this way.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.160]   We give a lot of crap to Facebook.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.600]   But Facebook is more responsive to--
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.200]   Ironically.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.040]   --if people have, exactly.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.680]   Then Google thinks they need to be.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.840]   I just don't understand what they get out of it.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.080]   I'm flummoxed.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.600]   I'm absolutely flummoxed.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.120]   You, Gina, and I tried to understand it as well on this week
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.480]   in Google.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   And that was the why Google why should have been the title of that job.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.040]   Jacob Weinberger wrote a wonderful post talking
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.680]   about how he is the Google fanboy.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.120]   He loves everything Google has.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.160]   He uses every product.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.000]   And we just don't understand.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.360]   And the response that Google gave didn't help.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.080]   No.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.520]   At all.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:11.920]   No.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.960]   It sounded like they were--
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.960]   what was the phrase they used in a Wired magazine?
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.560]   What's like arguing with my German in-laws.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.880]   I've learned how to argue with Germans, which is that they just
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.800]   repeat themselves and say it over and over and over again.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.200]   You'll finally say yes.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   And that's what it was.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.600]   It was just repeating the same points with more space.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   But it really did--
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.960]   A Wired call them carrier-humping net neutrality
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.160]   surrender monkeys.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.960]   I think that kind of says it all, doesn't it?
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   All right.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   All right.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.160]   I had--
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.960]   Jake and I had breakfast with Om Malek this weekend.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.160]   What did Om think?
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.880]   Om is making arguments that Google was kind of on the way
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.380]   down.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.560]   And I hear that all the time.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.480]   You know, you're in the end.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.760]   He says, Google's on the way down.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.080]   And people try to say it to me that, yeah, your book,
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.880]   you know, look at what would Google do?
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.880]   I still believe in Google.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.800]   I'm with Weinberger on this.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.520]   I still think that they're the smartest company around.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520]   I just believe they get it.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.080]   Well, he was talking about how--
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.280]   he was talking about his phone and how he uses apps to go
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.720]   directly to Yelp and everything instead of Googling,
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.640]   like restaurant reviews.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.200]   Right.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.720]   So I hope in that sense, searches--
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.120]   I would say--
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.440]   I would agree, searches on the way.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:13.920]   Right.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.680]   Not way down, but it's not the be all and end all.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.120]   There's other ways of getting stuff.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.320]   I think the app--
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.240]   to me, the app ecosystem is actually a negative.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.960]   I think so.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.840]   And we've talked about this, Jess, on this week in Google.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.360]   It's--
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.800]   It's organizing.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.840]   It's Virginia Heffernan's phrase in the New York Times.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.320]   It's the suburbs of the internet, where you go, it's safe.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.560]   It's protected.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.040]   People use iPhones like apps because they
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   want that kind of perfect experience.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.040]   But it's not the real internet.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.040]   Yeah, I'm almost saying, as I remember, Jake,
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.600]   that it wasn't just search.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   It was also that ad model then starts to go away.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.960]   When you have the closed app world, the more attended
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.440]   it grabs.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.520]   Yeah, Yelp's got-- and Yelp and Facebook,
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.080]   because they have location information tied with social graph.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.480]   That's more valuable, really, than the plain search index.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.440]   Although it's nice to have the search index, too.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.840]   One of my experiences-- I started doing trying check-ins on Yelp.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.800]   I was using-- I still use four square.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   All these different-- Yelp has four square-style check-ins.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.320]   But Yelp doesn't have a huge database of businesses.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.480]   That's where the search piece is kind of missing, right?
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.400]   And I imagine they're using something
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.800]   like Google's database of businesses.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.520]   So you do need search in conjunction with all of this stuff.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.680]   People aren't going to Google.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.200]   I think that's what he's trying to say.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.000]   They're not?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.680]   Well, I'm less-- Denise, are you going to Google less?
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.960]   I'm not going less, but I think maybe my son is.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.400]   This--
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.560]   Tyler uses Google?
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.480]   What we're-- yeah, I'm not unfettered.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.040]   But I guess what I'm getting at is--
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.800]   all of this is scaring me as a parent.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.080]   But the internet that he's growing up with looks far different
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.200]   than the one that I knew.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.440]   This is how hip you are.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.880]   Because a normal parent would say, oh, this is much safer.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.040]   There's no porn.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.680]   Now, Steve Jobs-- our phones have no smudge.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.120]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.120]   And so that's what a less hip parent would say.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.200]   But what you're saying is I want an open internet for my child.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.920]   I don't know if I'm saying that, actually.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   But thank you for crediting me with that degree of fitness.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.120]   We just sent him off in the car with his iPad,
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.640]   which I'm perfectly happy to let him play around on it.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.360]   Well, even though he could go to Safari and--
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.880]   You have to work hard to get porn on the iPad.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.480]   Exactly.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.360]   Trust me, I've done it.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.440]   I mean, only for research.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:24.800]   Right.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.880]   So it's good babysitting for three and a half hours.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.280]   But why do you think that it's bad for Tyler if Google makes
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.760]   a deal with Verizon?
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.760]   Well, I mean, I don't want him to grow up in a world where
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.200]   he lives only on apps and data is being harvested from him
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.240]   right and left, and maybe he doesn't know it,
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.560]   and doesn't know how to deal with that situation.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.120]   How soon will you let him have a Facebook page?
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.280]   Well, I certainly would abide by the company's terms of service.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.880]   And I'm not sure what the youngest--
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.480]   Speaking as a attorney, I would say 13, she says--
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.480]   It was 12, yes.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.240]   That's 13.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.080]   It's 13 because of--
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.280]   I think what did you do when he was 13?
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.400]   I'd be behind that.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.360]   I let my kids do it younger.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.040]   Jake, how old were you when you got on that?
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.000]   Well, I got on as soon as I could.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.760]   When I opened it up--
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.760]   So I was--
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.520]   You were younger, Bob.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.160]   I bought Jake here.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.480]   He's probably from a freshman year.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.720]   Oh, OK, so you were the right age.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.320]   But if you could have gotten in earlier--
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.400]   Jake, you've developed stuff for Facebook.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.760]   You've worked with FBML and all that stuff.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.640]   Well, my space was the big thing back then.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.080]   And Zenga, and everyone was on that,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.640]   so I'm sure it would have been the same thing.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.280]   Right.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   Right.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.800]   I mean, I don't think Google's going down.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.280]   I'm going to get there on the record.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.000]   I think that this is a warning shot to Google that says,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.360]   watch out.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.800]   Warning shot from its users.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.080]   We're-- you want to know evil?
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.560]   We just defined evil.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.080]   We did it.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.840]   We did it.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.400]   We told you what evil is.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.320]   Now, you can-- we're like God here.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.080]   We'll forgive you.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.000]   We will forgive you.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.600]   You're saying we, the consumers, your users.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.080]   We have grace.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.640]   And we will forgive you, Google.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.080]   But you better understand the errors of your ways here.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.800]   That's my view.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.520]   But then, is that just us geeky nuts?
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.240]   And nobody else cares?
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.080]   Well, I wonder.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.720]   And I think probably that's the calculus
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.040]   that Google and Verizon have made.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.360]   Certainly, the calculus of Comcast for rising, AT&T
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.160]   are always making.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.520]   We can shut down these bit to our guys,
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.440]   because that's just a small fraction.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.240]   So geeks never really liked Microsoft
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.840]   until Scoble made them cuddly.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.880]   And so it never really hurt them?
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.280]   Was that--
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:28.280]   He did.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.080]   --were this heads?
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.440]   Didn't it?
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:29.960]   It didn't.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.280]   It didn't.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:30.680]   I don't know.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.160]   I guess you're right.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.520]   It didn't.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.200]   You're absolutely right.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.240]   It didn't hurt Microsoft.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.520]   So would it hurt Google if geeks don't like them anymore?
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.520]   I would like to think that they're good.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.160]   Geeks don't have to like a company for it
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.600]   to be successful in the enterprise, which Microsoft
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.880]   has always traditionally been.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.760]   And geeks are never going to use Bing.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.160]   Well, Google's made of geeks.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   That's all their products are--
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.120]   It's made of geeks.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.560]   They all have such bad UI, because it's geeks making them.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.040]   Show name.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.560]   Soil and dread.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.600]   Soil and dread.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.880]   It's made of geeks.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.360]   Well, you know, we really--
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.440]   I almost feel like on this week in Google,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.800]   we talked this subject out.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.280]   We had to bring it up on this week in tech,
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.720]   because we hadn't talked about it.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.760]   It happened between the last show and this show.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.120]   But I think you and I and everybody else
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.800]   are having the same reaction, which is why Google, why?
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.560]   Shaking our heads.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.760]   And I don't know.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.320]   We're angry at Google, but we still love Google, don't we?
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.160]   We're not-- nobody's willing to give up on Google yet.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:29.960]   I totally agree with that.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.440]   Yep.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.560]   There's no reason to yet.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   No.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.840]   No reason to yet?
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.120]   Hasn't changed day to day how Google operates.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.760]   I wonder how much dissent inside Google
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   there is overall this issue.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   That's what I was going to say.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.480]   If the Chris to bonus of the world start to rear up and say,
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.000]   I'm sorry, this is not working for me anymore,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.480]   then Google's got a problem.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.360]   That's a good point.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.480]   I was thinking we probably should have had Kevin Marks on
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.960]   last week, since he's out of Google, but has Google friends.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.520]   He might have--
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.720]   I will contact Kevin and Chris for this week in Google on Wednesday.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.880]   We should get them on.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.840]   I'd be very curious what they have to say about this.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:12.000]   It felt like a week where we lost our innocence a little bit
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   about Google.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.120]   I'm going there tomorrow.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:14.600]   Are you?
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.640]   I'm going to Jake and I are getting a tour of the Promised Land.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.160]   And then I'm having lunch with Google News folks
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.520]   and a couple of the meetings.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.760]   I hope you'll ask around.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.840]   I'll be with the PR people, so who
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.600]   we're going to try to get someone on last show.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.120]   OK.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.120]   We're carrying.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.360]   And see what they say.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.400]   Well, I think this is true of Microsoft,
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.000]   although nobody ever really wanted to admit it.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.960]   But all of these big companies, when you have tens of thousands
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.800]   of employees, there's a huge diversity of opinion
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.480]   within the company.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.600]   There's no unified point of view.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.440]   And I think it's pretty clear, at least in the China situation,
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.680]   Eric Schmidt had one point of view.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.000]   And Larry and Sergey, the founders,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.240]   and another point of view.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.920]   And Eric, one briefly, the founders eventually one.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.680]   I don't know if there's that same kind of division up at the top.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.960]   This time, there might be.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.360]   What I wonder is whether the employees were talking about this on buzz.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.280]   I didn't see anything.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:00.800]   Not at neither.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.520]   I followed buzz carefully.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.240]   As you know, I'm the only one.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.440]   Well, they tried hard to couch this,
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:11.440]   speaking with the PR people, as something that was not far down
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.720]   on the evil spectrum at all.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.280]   In fact, something that is good and healthy for everything.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.960]   But as Leo said, it was this kind of, well,
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.600]   this is the best we could get.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.880]   This is compromised.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   No.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.400]   Right.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.200]   Well, it's not a compromise.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.160]   Devil's in the details.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.800]   Am I being a drama queen about all this?
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.720]   Lenin 2010 says, you do the same thing with Facebook,
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.200]   all the hyperbole in the drama.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.360]   Am I being a drama queen?
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.920]   Is this not a big deal?
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.680]   I mean, you can tell me the truth.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.880]   I think we learned that it certainly
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.480]   gets a lot of attention when a couple of Fortune 500 or 100
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.960]   companies get together and make a policy statement like this.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.000]   Even though it has no force of law, it's going to--
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   It's scary to me.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.880]   --need attention to.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.360]   And it could be influential and sway people's opinions
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.040]   in Washington and--
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.280]   A separate internet is a big deal.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.360]   It's a bad thing.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.040]   Period.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.280]   And that's what they're saying.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.080]   Actually, two or three tiered internet.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.480]   It's not even just a two tiered internet.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.080]   You have the open internet, the wireless internet,
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.480]   which is very closed.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.240]   And then you have this kind of pay-per-view internet.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.680]   It's the inception internet.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.240]   Inception?
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.520]   Oh, it's like three dreams?
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.440]   The jig to the last minute.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.920]   All right, well, let me give you the kick.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.360]   Hey, you ready for your kick?
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.240]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.800]   We've got a great cast of characters here, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.000]   from buzzmachine.com, his son Jake Jarvis,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.520]   from jakejars.com, and Denise Howell,
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.320]   from bagginbaggage.com.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.160]   And we have much more to talk about.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:40.960]   Google's being sued.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.000]   Now Google's going to be the bad guy.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.920]   And the bad guy, we got an even worse villain in the scene
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.880]   here.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.360]   Only Larry Ellison could be a worse villain
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.440]   in this situation.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.200]   Before we do, though, I want to say hello to the folks
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.360]   at Ford and thank them for bringing us out
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.240]   to the Ford plant.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.280]   We had so much fun watching those F-150 trucks being built.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.480]   I hope you saw the specials that we made from the Ford plant.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.160]   Three of them, and then one from Maker Faire Detroit,
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.880]   which was amazing.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.960]   That's all on the Twitch specials feed.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.360]   This episode is brought to you by the all new 2011 Ford
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:09.760]   Fiesta.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.280]   That's-- yeah, that's the car I crashed into.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.240]   By the way, not a scratch.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.640]   I drove a flex into a Fiesta.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.320]   You didn't see that, did you?
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.360]   Anyway, my fault, they wanted me to tell you
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.840]   that it works fine, which isn't the other person.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.280]   And not a scratch on it.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.560]   The Fiesta is really cool.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.120]   The new 2011 I drove it the other day.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.000]   It's the most fuel efficient compact car on the road today.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.560]   It's a gas vehicle with get this an EPA estimated 40 miles
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.760]   per gallon highway.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.640]   That means it can go from LA to San Francisco
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.720]   in a single tank of--
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.920]   I could have driven up here.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.320]   How many tanks of gas did you use?
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.240]   It took me two.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.160]   And my Porsche's parked on the perse, outside.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.600]   No, no, it's a Cayenne.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.880]   It's an older one.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.760]   And I'm telling you, my next car, which
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.360]   is going to be real, real soon now when they update sync.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.600]   The next time, it's going to be a Ford.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.000]   But for you, Denise, sync won me over.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.280]   I love the sync and the Ford.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.640]   So how does the Fiesta compare?
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.200]   More miles per gallon highway than the Yaris from Toyota.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.560]   Over the Honda Civic, you'll save up to $182 a year in gas.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.760]   And of course, it's a great ride.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.400]   They're really-- you put your foot on the pedal.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.680]   It's very responsive, very energized.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.120]   That's because it has that Dura Tech 1.6 liter I4 engine
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.840]   in it, a front strut McPherson suspension.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.560]   That might even rival your Porsche there.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.040]   It's a front sway bar, 22 millimeter sway bar,
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.440]   and twist beam rear suspension.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.600]   Give it a very nice ride, very snappy punchy.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.160]   This thing feels great.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.080]   You don't feel like you're getting 40 miles to the gallon.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   Let me put it that way.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.600]   Best in class fuel efficiency, great performance,
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.920]   a good looking interior and exterior design
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.520]   you want to see for yourself.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.360]   Yeah, that's really kind of something special.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.280]   Trio Ford Fiesta, the 2011s are just out this week
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.120]   at a Ford dealer near you.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.440]   Drive 1, we think you'll like it.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.760]   This week in technology is a Google show, is an Oracle show,
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.080]   is a Microsoft show, is an Apple show.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.320]   All of those companies, the big names in technology,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.640]   Facebook 2 in the news.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.800]   Let's talk about the Oracle thing.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.400]   It's Oracle suing Google over Android.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.680]   We got a lawyer in here.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.120]   Thank God, didn't he tell?
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.920]   It's not often you say that.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.320]   Sorry.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.560]   Thank God, there's a lawyer in the room.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.080]   Yes.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.560]   I don't hear that very often.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.280]   You know?
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.120]   That's what Shakespeare said.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.320]   First, let's call a lawyer.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.120]   The folks at--
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   Type O.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.320]   [BUZZER]
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.680]   Wrong.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.160]   The folks at Sun put up with the fact
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.880]   that Google rewrote the Java Virtual Machine.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.400]   They call it Dalvik and made Android based on Dalvik,
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.920]   the Java Virtual Machine.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.640]   I guess it is technically a violation
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.200]   of the rules of engagement.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.160]   I'm not an expert on this, but in the Java.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.400]   But Sun knew it and said, eh, maybe because Sun was
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.640]   a lot smaller than Google.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.400]   Oracle buys Sun, and one of the first things they do
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.240]   is they sue Google, saying you're violating
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.160]   our intellectual property.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.040]   This one's going to go on for years, isn't it?
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.000]   I think so, yes.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.160]   This is not a quick and easy.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.360]   Especially since Google has come out
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.720]   saying what they have said, which is not only is this
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.560]   a baseless lawsuit, but it threatens
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.360]   the entire infrastructure of open source licensing.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.720]   Does it really?
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.320]   That's what they are contending.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.200]   One of the things that puzzles me is that Android and Dalvik
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:32.000]   is licensed under the Apache license, and Sun is GPL,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.520]   and they-- which seem on the face of it,
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.200]   seem incompatible.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.320]   I know this is real, Arcana, and I don't expect you to respond
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.200]   in any way, a hellishable way to it.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.960]   But it just--
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.680]   That's a good thing.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.080]   I'm not a hot lawyer.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.000]   I know, it's insanely complicated.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.320]   It also seems a little bit hostile,
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.440]   but not that Larry Ellison has ever been anything,
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.480]   but aggressive in his business practices.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.840]   There's a great article which I have put in our show notes
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.440]   from Tico Systems on this lawsuit.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.320]   Let me see if I can kind of summarize here.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.040]   It's not Oracle versus Google.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.400]   Why is the question mark?
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.280]   This is a redmonk.com.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.680]   When Android debuted in 2006, I couldn't figure out
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.520]   how Google had managed to apply an Apache license to the project.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.720]   This is, as I mentioned, it was a GPL license project.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.240]   Google wasn't using Sun's virtual machine.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.280]   They built their own, as Danger did before it.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.880]   And of course, the Google Android is based kind of on Danger.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.080]   Google said it's a clean, room implementation.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.000]   We've seen this before.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.680]   This is how the whole bio-swars back
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.520]   in the early days of the PC, the PC clones,
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.360]   were based on the IBM PC, but they did it in a clean room.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.120]   What does that mean when they say clean room environment?
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.560]   I think of where they fab chips when people say that.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.040]   It's basically their reverse--
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.560]   I think they reverse engineering it.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.520]   They have a redone from scratch.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.000]   They cannot look at the code.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.760]   They cannot try to disassemble the code.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.520]   They have to merely emulate-- you're the programmer in here, Jake.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.960]   They merely emulate what the code does without actually
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.680]   looking at it.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:16.480]   What he says in this blog post is it's not clear why Google
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:22.000]   reimplemented the JVM, but they knew it was risky.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.880]   He says could have reasonably assumed
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.960]   that the probability of Sun suing them was near zero.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:33.880]   This is the hazard of any open source based product.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.680]   Is this a problem for open source in general?
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   It is a problem for open source in general,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.240]   because there are always murky issues about what
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.320]   has gone into the mix.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.400]   We do see constant lawsuits over all open source software.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.520]   Right, because you can take two from column A
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.200]   and one from column B and some of them may be licensed one way
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.920]   and some may be not licensed at all.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.480]   I've never happened to the famous infamous open source
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.160]   troll company.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.800]   I'm forgetting the name of them.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.040]   It went after again and again and again,
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.640]   and it would be a threat to the whole world.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.560]   The skull thing?
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   It's over.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   It goes over.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.200]   It only took 25 years practically, but just recently
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.080]   the whole skull thing went away.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.080]   Right.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   Because they claimed that--
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.240]   It's a good addition for years and years.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.600]   Great blog called Grog Law followed it all very, very closely.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.760]   Huge cost, right?
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:23.800]   Huge.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.320]   But mostly it cost a skull because skull lost big time
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.840]   on this and Linux was--
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.800]   You know, you know, scope bought the Unix name basically.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.720]   And they said, well, it's Unix and you're stealing Unix code.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.880]   They had-- there was no merit.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.720]   Although, remember that Microsoft also owns some of this stuff
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   and has in fact licensed--
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.360]   remember they indemnified people who use--
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.280]   what was the deal?
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.160]   They indemnified people who use Microsoft products or Linux.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.080]   I can't remember the deal.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.320]   They made a deal with Linux over that and said, OK,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.960]   if you pay our license, well, we'll protect you.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960]   Right.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.120]   Linux actually has provisions in its documentation
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.160]   where every time you alter the kernel, contribute to the kernel
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.200]   and it gets accepted, you're supposedly
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.440]   indemnifying that you are the original intellectual property
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.280]   creator there.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   That's another--
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:15.800]   Yes.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   You've got a million developers.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.600]   You can't always be sure that it's clean.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.600]   Right, right.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   So-- and the GPL people have been fighting along the way
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.360]   to update the license, which happened not too long ago.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.840]   I guess the current version has provisions
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.520]   that would deal with this situation that would--
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.760]   In this blog post, he says, really, the issue
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.080]   is you're going to damage the son Java ecosystem by this lawsuit.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.000]   You're going to make it very unlikely that people will look
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.400]   at Java and say, oh, we should use Java.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.800]   But on the other hand, the benefit you might make some money,
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.880]   they spent something like $6 billion, $6 and 1/2 billion
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.480]   for son.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.800]   So he's saying, basically, they're
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.280]   trying to get back their money even though--
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.640]   in their financial justifications,
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.240]   even though there'll be ecosystem, long-term damage
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.040]   to the ecosystem for a short-term cash windfall.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.440]   So what in the chat room said to you, Leo,
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.040]   that wired to say, this is the end of Java?
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:12.760]   It could be.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.440]   Who would take a chance with knowing Oracle?
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.960]   You're not going to mess with it.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.400]   And I think this was one of the concerns when Oracle bought
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.600]   son.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   People were a little afraid of what's going to happen to Java.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.680]   It was part of the movement to end software patents.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.200]   I mean, it's hopeless.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.680]   That's something I'd love to see.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.080]   Is that-- how likely is that?
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.120]   Not very likely in the wake of the Supreme Court's
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.920]   recent statement on that front.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.680]   What do they say?
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.280]   Software patents still survive.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.040]   They're not going to be ruled out as they have been in other
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.960]   countries, such as the EU.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.280]   And I believe Australia has a similar piece of legislation
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.440]   pending, where they're just going to say,
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.560]   that category of item is just not going to be unique enough,
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.480]   have that whiz-bang factor that leads something
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.560]   to be able to be patented.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.400]   They're going to say, you can take this on a case-by-case
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.600]   basis, and we're going to let the Patent and Trademark Office
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.240]   work it out, which--
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.800]   So if that happens--
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.760]   --you know, they haven't been doing too fabulous a job on that.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   Right.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.880]   I'm Beth Novick this week, interviewing my book
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   on the peer-to-patent movement.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.880]   And she's done some really neat work on that.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.640]   And the patent office is a mess.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:34.080]   So if you had Europe patent-free on software,
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.920]   you're still stuck with the lowest common denominator,
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.120]   aren't you?
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.560]   You're still stuck with America.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.280]   Right.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:38.800]   You are.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.000]   Well, it doesn't look good.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.400]   Nice to know we're the lowest common denominator.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.400]   Right.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.520]   So Miguel Diacaza has also blogged a little bit on this.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.560]   He's the guy who did the gnome.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:56.400]   And he's currently doing an open source mono,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.200]   the open source version of a .net.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.480]   And he thinks it's a good chance that Google just
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.720]   give him some billions of dollars to go away.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.720]   And then Oracle goes one by one through all the OEMs.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.040]   Google gives them money for the Google implementation
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.600]   of Android.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.040]   And then it's on to HTC and Motorola and one by one.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.160]   And Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison have a coffee recently.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.760]   Good question, because it sure is something
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.200]   that Steve would love to see happen.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:24.920]   They did not.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.520]   They did not.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.680]   They open handset alliance.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.600]   And Google did not license sun before they made Delvik.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   And I guess that's the issue.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   And perhaps it was something that Jonathan Schwartz knew
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.040]   when he was shopping the company that maybe he told Larry
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.600]   Ellison, hey, by the way, you could always
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.400]   get some of this money back by showing Google.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.280]   Anyway, it's a bad thing.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.200]   At the same time as they did that, I guess they thought,
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.520]   well, everybody will be paying attention to that.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.160]   Maybe we'll also announce that we're
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.840]   going to stop open Solaris.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.000]   And that's another bad move from Oracle
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.200]   for the open source movement.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.920]   This is a really great open source operating system.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.160]   All I can say is I wouldn't want to be the lawyer at Google
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.680]   who had blessed Android from the legal standpoint.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.080]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:04.800]   I think they knew.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.600]   I don't think any lawyer would say, oh, no, you
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.280]   don't have to license that.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.200]   I think it was a calculus.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.480]   I'm sure the lawyers said, no, dudes,
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   you're really exposed here.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.560]   And the calculus was, wow, son, what are they going to do about it?
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.960]   Explain it to me, though, now, if you could magically rewrite
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.840]   Android again, do you lower your liability?
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.760]   No, you license it.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.440]   You license it or you get in--
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.080]   So it's all negotiation now.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.840]   There's no alternative negotiation.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.800]   They can't go back now.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   They can't start over.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.840]   Right.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.760]   They've already done it.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.960]   What's done is done.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.800]   They're either going to give them a packet of money
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.960]   or they're going to say, come and get me
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.880]   and it'll go on for years.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.480]   But that's risky, isn't it?
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.000]   It's risky.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.240]   Could a judge issue an injunction saying
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.280]   you can't sell this anymore?
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:51.840]   Absolutely.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.920]   And Oracle will probably seek that kind of relief.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.560]   Like Tebow.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.640]   Right.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.080]   We're at the very beginning stages of this here.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.920]   I got another great legal conundrum
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.280]   for the great legal minds.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:05.840]   Mind does.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.240]   Single mind.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.920]   There's one mind in the rest of us.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.320]   Denise Owl, this is a very interesting story from Facebook.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.360]   A New Jersey town has started posting photos
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.240]   on Facebook of people they arrest for DUIs.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.480]   It's the Evesham Police Department.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:30.520]   The mugshot of a suspected auto thief who
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.920]   was apprehended in Evesham was posted on its Facebook page.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.480]   Then they started posting DUIs.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.360]   Now, as far as I can tell, these are not--
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.320]   These are not people convicted of a crime.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.280]   This is really disturbing.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.640]   I'm hoping the ACLU is paying some attention
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.000]   and perhaps going in and challenge this practice
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.760]   because these people have privacy rights.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.040]   I don't know that you give up your privacy rights simply
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.400]   by being accused of a crime.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.000]   But isn't that all public record?
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.800]   In Europe, you couldn't do this.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.840]   It's against the law there.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.640]   But here, the police blotter is a public record.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.720]   Not the pictures.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.280]   Well, but no, yeah.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.800]   Really?
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.840]   I'm a reporter.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.440]   I'm a newspaper reporter.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.560]   I won't show the full thing.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.640]   But here's the Facebook post.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.400]   On August 4th, the Evesham Police Department
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.520]   located and arrested a mail being
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.520]   sent by the Lower Providence Township, PA Police Department.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.240]   And they're looking for who this guy is.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.160]   They're saying, "Tangum."
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.600]   So far, they haven't-- nobody's--
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.920]   I think it's most wanted.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.640]   It's America's most wanted.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.280]   Yes, yes.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.360]   Oh, OK.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.120]   We had a story like this on "Twill,"
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.000]   where someone was riding the subway in Boston
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.400]   and engaging in some not safe for anywhere sorts of activities.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.880]   And another passenger got angry and posted a picture
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.400]   to Twitter and said--
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.120]   didn't know who this person was, but wanted
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.680]   to see if they could apprehend him.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.080]   And sure enough, they did.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.640]   Is it legal to do that?
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.280]   Sure.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.400]   You can take a picture of a person in a public place.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.200]   It's public place.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.840]   Especially if they're breaking the law in some way.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.800]   OK, that was a private individual doing it, though.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.280]   Yes.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:09.800]   That was private.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.560]   Is it different if a police department does it?
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.600]   I think it is.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:12.880]   I mean--
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.320]   I think there's the presumption if I see this
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.520]   that the guy is guilty of a crime.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.920]   And isn't that exactly what you're not supposed to be?
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.400]   Right.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.480]   You're innocent to prove it.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.000]   Even with--
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.440]   Given that the police blotter may be public,
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.280]   and I just think you have that information there,
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.080]   but you're not--
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.040]   once you start having a police department
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.760]   boosting it on the internet--
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.480]   But I think-- well, hold on, hold on, counselor.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.920]   You, by the way, Jeff and Dana Boyd had this debate.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.400]   Yes.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:38.760]   Yes.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.640]   The last month in--
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.400]   Carol and McCarthy and Cenet's saying that, in fact,
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.200]   this exact issue was debated last month later.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:45.720]   Exactly.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.080]   I think that we have to be more public.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.360]   And yes, there is an issue that you're innocent
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.360]   and the proven guilty.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   Amen, Consta, we like that.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:52.760]   But--
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.320]   Yes, we do.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.280]   I particularly enjoy that.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.080]   But it happens all the time now in a high profile case.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.240]   So who's to say what the line is between high profile
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.280]   and low profile?
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.800]   What freaks us out here is this could be any of us.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.280]   Right.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:07.720]   Right?
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.920]   And these are not serial murderers going off and doing things.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.840]   These are just plain old people.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.920]   But it's still--
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.800]   they are people in the public record
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.840]   who are accused of a crime.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.280]   And that right now, unless it's--
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.520]   the crime people are wrong, unless it's
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.520]   quashed in some way, that's open.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.040]   That's in newspapers all the time, isn't it?
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:22.560]   Yes, it is.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.880]   So my question is, it doesn't look like it's--
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.320]   in some cases, for instance, here's--
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.480]   on August 12, 2010, police responded to the Walmart store,
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.080]   two shoplifting suspects chased on foot.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.280]   They were hiding in neighborhood.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.400]   Here's their picture, their age, their city.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.560]   Is this punitive?
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.880]   Is this-- they're not asking for information.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.800]   But these people have not been convicted of a crime.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.280]   Well, it's good to know.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.760]   But they're being punished without due process.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.000]   Yeah, that's what's disturbing about this to me.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.960]   Is that it's one thing-- you know, a newspaper has--
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.840]   Oh, look, and look at the disclaimer.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.400]   Old person's on this page, or an incident
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.080]   until proven guilty in a court of law.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.680]   Like that gets them off the whole.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.760]   Sounds like a voice from Dragnet.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.640]   Hey, you're on.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.200]   Are we posted on our Facebook wall?
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.160]   It was our status post for crying out loud.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.400]   Look at all these-- look at all these perps on here.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.200]   And by the way, I am not a Facebook member,
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.000]   and I'm not logged in.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.600]   So this is not just for Facebook.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.360]   So this is public information.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.720]   If one of those people were accused of murder,
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.520]   we wouldn't be raising our eyebrows so much, right?
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.840]   Because that's what we would.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.000]   I would, yeah.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.520]   Because--
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.240]   Don't you say that police are seeking Joe Schmo?
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.760]   And here's his picture, and here's what he looks like?
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.440]   You're putting in, though-- the extrapolation here
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.520]   is that journalists have access to that information.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.880]   That doesn't mean that the rest of us--
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.400]   Ah, but we're all journalists.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   Yeah, well--
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.840]   But also, though, there's this tradition of saying allegedly
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.080]   was-- is accused of--
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.680]   they're looking for somebody in conjunction
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.000]   with an investigation of an event.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.720]   They never say something like this.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.560]   Because, Leo--
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.080]   Patricia Figueroa, age 45, was arrested for shoplifting
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.080]   from the coals store.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.080]   Here's your picture.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.480]   But Leo, here's what we do in journalism.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.960]   We quote the police saying that.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.800]   So this is just the police saying it.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.240]   This cuts out the middleman, the mediator of media.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.440]   Everybody has access to police water now.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.880]   And it takes the police and puts them
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.840]   into the role of the journalist.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.360]   Yep.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.960]   Yep.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.880]   I don't know.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.280]   I think that's where I have a privacy situation.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.160]   But I don't see the legal issue with it today.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.560]   So what side were you--
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   Were you arguing with Dana and Dana
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.000]   was saying-- what was Dana's argument?
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.040]   Dana was basically saying she was on the good side.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.400]   Uh, what do you mean, my side?
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.520]   You know, say, watch out.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.320]   And especially this is going to hit certain groups of people
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.160]   worse than others.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:35.680]   Yes.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.520]   And it will be used now.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.560]   And I agree with all those concerns.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.360]   I'd like to point that out that there's mostly people
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.200]   of color on this page.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.280]   But right now, the way the law stands today,
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.480]   the police blotter is open to the public.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.080]   And the public is not set on under the journalist.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.560]   The public is the public.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.720]   And especially now that I could go and start a town law
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.840]   and do this, I have all this access.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.240]   I do think it's interesting.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   I think there's--
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:56.560]   It's fascinating.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.160]   There's something to talk about on the legal standpoint.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.160]   I want to hear this on Twitter.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:00.800]   It's not a slam dunk.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.320]   So it's not clear cut.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.880]   It strikes me as by posting it there.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:10.280]   And it's-- you know, as a normal person reading this,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.360]   they're not saying accused of or was in the investigation of.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.960]   They're saying, we arrested these two for doing this.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.320]   We're used to the language of the journalist
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.560]   as mediator between this and the police.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.560]   This is the language of police.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.640]   The perpetrator-- they're saying the perpetrator did this,
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.080]   did that.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:26.760]   They don't say allegedly.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.760]   They say we're charging this person with us.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.520]   That's the way they talk.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.080]   Oh, so it's all the journalists are saying it's useless.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.880]   It's the journalists who add in the alleged.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.520]   It's the journalists because the journalists are covering
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.920]   their rears in this.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.320]   And they attribute it to the police.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.280]   They do use the word suspect here.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.360]   They don't use the word bad guy.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.920]   I mean, does that lamb off the hook?
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.880]   I don't know.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.160]   Right.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.800]   Sometimes when you take already publicly available information
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.920]   and you have the public entity that
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.480]   is in charge of that information, all of a sudden,
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.080]   making it widely available on the internet.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:00.280]   Right.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.560]   Thinking of court documents, for example.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.440]   It does change things.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.840]   Yeah, I mean, all of that is public.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.480]   All of this is the same as you would see in the court document.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.440]   Somebody could start posting all of our household deeds
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   somewhere online.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.520]   That's all public.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.080]   But if the county started doing it, I don't know.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.640]   But then I think there's a troubling line
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.200]   if you go back the other way and say, OK, well,
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.560]   we don't like this with the DWI because it could be anybody.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.080]   Then where does that line end?
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.760]   And I argue that what's public is public.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.400]   And if you enable people not to put this stuff up,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.760]   then at some point when the mayor is arrested for DUI.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.440]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.160]   And the mayor claims the same right.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.560]   And the mayor says, no, no, no, you can't release my name.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.520]   We would all be screaming bloody murder.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.600]   No, you're the mayor.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.080]   OK.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.480]   But there you have the journalistic interest in the story
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.840]   that would pull that out.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.960]   Yeah, but if I'm barista net in Montclair, New Jersey,
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.480]   any of my neighbors is of journalistic interest.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:51.960]   No, no.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.160]   You have a perient interest.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.680]   The mayor is of true interest because he is to being held to a high--
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.320]   No, but down the street, I've seen him running down the block.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.720]   I'm glad they finally got Norby.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.080]   Jesus, I saw him at the bar, and then he comes along.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.800]   And finally, yeah.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.920]   That's perient.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.640]   That's perient.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.400]   A mayor is an elected official.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.520]   There's a higher standard.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.240]   What about the stories--
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:13.760]   I love this.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.640]   We're in law class now.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.560]   That's the only reason why you never want to take law.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.440]   You don't want to practice law.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.240]   You just want to take a law class forever, right?
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.800]   That's going to be fun.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.440]   What about the towns that put up Johns as a way to--
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.280]   It's a similar age, isn't it?
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.640]   --to people from being John?
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.520]   But those are convicted, Johns.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.880]   Not always.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.720]   I think they were arrested.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.440]   I think they were arrested.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.640]   They were up there.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   Mm-hmm.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   I don't know.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   I understand the issues here, but I think that--
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.880]   I've never seen a John on the internet.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.760]   Here's an interesting question from our chatroom.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.440]   Curtis P says, "To ask you Denise if the suspect posted here
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.760]   could then sue for defamation if they're
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.200]   proven innocent afterwards."
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.000]   I don't think so.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.600]   No.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.800]   Nothing about what they--
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.880]   All it said is they were arrested.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.480]   They were arrested.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.320]   They're a suspect.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.160]   It's all true.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.520]   You could sue for false arrest in certain cases.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.480]   But nothing on this page is untrue.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.520]   Nothing just doesn't do this.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.000]   There is a species of defamation called false light.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.720]   You're portraying a person in a false light.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.640]   And this kind of comes close to that,
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.760]   but I think the police are covered here.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.880]   They're not.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.520]   Other than under privacy kinds of considerations.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.040]   If they do have arrest, they're like, well, other ways.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:18.800]   Yeah, right, right, right.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.880]   Because not on Facebook, people would have no problem with this.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.800]   It's because it's on Facebook.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.160]   You're absolutely right, Jake.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.640]   Or if the police department was posting it on its site.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.760]   If they had a bulletin board, it'd be the same.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   If they had a--
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.120]   What's the site?
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:30.600]   What's the site?
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   We're going to get past sites.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.520]   You go to where the people are.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.560]   What does it mean?
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.120]   Well, let me ask you both.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.720]   If Barista Net posted this for every person arrested
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   in Montclair, New Jersey, would you have the same problem?
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.480]   Barista Net?
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.320]   That's a local blog.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:42.960]   Hyper-local blog.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.480]   OK.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.480]   No.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.000]   Right.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.520]   Right.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.040]   No.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:46.840]   I guess not.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.340]   No.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.600]   It's because it's Facebook for right, Jake.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.200]   It's Facebook.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.080]   It's way too public.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.040]   You have the problem with the police department, Jake, doing this?
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.040]   No.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.560]   I mean, you can do the--
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.320]   I have a problem with the police department
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.440]   doing it on its own Facebook page.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.800]   Why, though?
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:04.320]   Because I think that they're taking on a journalistic role
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.160]   that actually winds up violating people's privacy
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.240]   expectations.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   Interesting.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.200]   I think it's because they're punishing them without due
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:13.720]   process.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.400]   They're punishing them before the trial
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.800]   by publicizing their information.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.840]   It's like, well, you got arrested.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.960]   So here's your punishment.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   Well, part of the protection we have
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.280]   is that your trial is held in public.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.040]   For the accused as well.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.800]   And part of the protection accused people have
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.200]   is that their jury pool is not tainted.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:32.800]   So this is--
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.680]   Oh, that's true too.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.840]   This might take the jury pool.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.880]   I love Leo's role in this.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.080]   You know what I find very interesting, which--
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:41.640]   you're all right.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.720]   I love you.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.520]   What I find very interesting is--
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.720]   and this is really what you are studying.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.520]   It always comes down to is our notion of privacy
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.640]   in public has completely changed.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.920]   And it's only because these tools, when things are public,
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.560]   they're public.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.840]   And when they're private, they're in private.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.240]   And these tools change.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.560]   This internet changes that.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.440]   There's a great discussion going on my blog
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:09.040]   as I'm researching my book in which one post Sam Lesson, who
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.000]   started Drop I O, I think I mentioned this.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:11.520]   Nice guy.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.240]   And this week in Google said that what's happened economically
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.120]   is that the price of privacy used
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.560]   to be free and publicness, publicity, cost you a lot.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.160]   It was very expensive to be a star.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.560]   It's the exact opposite now.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.280]   Publicity is cheap and privacy is expensive.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:27.840]   That's true.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.440]   That's effort.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.080]   That's true.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.440]   And then David Weinberger came in
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.040]   and said we have a public privacy access here.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:33.960]   They're not binary.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.280]   It's not one or the other.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   But he said that in the old days,
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.520]   you were either Maryland or Roe or you were a schmoe.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.880]   And now we all have a celebrity.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.960]   We all do these issues.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.920]   And it does change how we deal with having a public face
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.840]   because we all have one now.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.640]   Even if we don't have our own Facebook page,
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.520]   we can be tagged on a Facebook page.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.040]   So here's another link from the chatroom, Chicago Tribune,
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.240]   Mugs in the News, a collection of Chicago area
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.600]   arrest photos, arrest and booking photos
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.800]   are provided by law enforcement officials.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.840]   Arrested, not imply guilty criminal charges
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.360]   are merely accusations.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.840]   A defendant is presumed innocent unless presumed guilty.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.120]   He doesn't look happy.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.440]   This is, but this is maybe voyeurism, but it's fun.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.960]   (laughing)
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.680]   That's how I know it's wrong.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.280]   It's way too interesting.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.120]   All right, we're gonna take another break.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.040]   Jeff Jarvis, Jake Jarvis are here.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.080]   Denise Howell as well.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.480]   We're glad you're here as well.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.320]   Talking about legal stuff.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.680]   We got some more tech news also.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.160]   And I wanna talk a little bit about the hot piece of--
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.480]   (imitates whooshing)
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.960]   (laughing)
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.720]   The HPO, I'd never heard of that.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.680]   Have you ever heard of that acronym?
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.520]   I never heard of that.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.840]   I think they made it up.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.680]   Have you ever heard of it, Jake?
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.520]   Nope.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.360]   No.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.440]   It's probably in the urban dictionary,
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.480]   but we're way too sophisticated to know about that.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.760]   Before we do, I do wanna mention our friends at Citrix.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.320]   They do go to meeting that wonderful software
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.240]   that you use to save yourself from travel.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.360]   See if Jeff and Denise just used go to meet
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.840]   and they could be nice and comfortable in Scotts' at home.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.160]   Actually, go to meetings not so great for vacations,
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.400]   but for business, yes.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.240]   They have a lot of money.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.080]   I mean, it'd be a bad idea.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.440]   Go to meeting Disney World.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.280]   That's what's going on.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   (laughing)
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.120]   And that's interesting.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.120]   I'm talking about virtual reality.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.240]   You know, I imagine future versions of go to meeting.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.000]   Go to meeting 2012 might have that feature.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.840]   Just put on the helmet and you're there.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.160]   The whole idea go to meeting is to take
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.160]   that boring conference call,
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.440]   unproductive conference call,
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.560]   and make it effective, make it visual, make it engaging.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.240]   That's just what it's all about.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.000]   It's about saving you time and travel money.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.480]   It's about being engaged.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.320]   Go to meeting keeps everybody on the same page
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.160]   during conference calls.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.440]   Everybody on the call could see your screen.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.280]   See what's happens.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.120]   You're on a conference call.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.840]   You can do it on the fly.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.480]   You just say, okay, everybody,
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.600]   go to go to meeting.com right now.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.440]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.360]   Now, suddenly they're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.600]   You can show them the PowerPoint
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.640]   or the keynote presentation.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.240]   Yes, the Mac or PC.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.280]   You could show them spreadsheets.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.360]   You can collaborate too.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.560]   You know, you can say here,
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.400]   what do you think?
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.480]   What's wrong with this paragraph?
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.000]   And they can type.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.680]   They can take control and show you
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.640]   what's on their computer as well.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.360]   Up to 15 people at a time.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.720]   Everyone on the call more focused,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.720]   more interested, more engaged.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.560]   You're gonna love it.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.160]   For sales presentations, for product demos,
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.400]   for training, collaborating, weekly update calls,
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.760]   we use it all the time here.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.520]   We have several accounts.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.840]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.640]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.240]   G-O-T-O meeting.com/twit.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.440]   30 days free unlimited use.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.440]   You know, just give it a try.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.040]   Show your colleagues, your clients,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:39.880]   show the boss.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.640]   I think the boss will be impressed.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.600]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.080]   We thank him so much for his support.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.680]   This week in tech, Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.600]   The book, "What Would Google Do?"
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.880]   Do you have to rewrite it now a little bit now that you--
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.360]   - I'll probably do, I'll just talk to the publisher.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   I'll probably do a new forward for it.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.360]   - What Google, what did Google do?
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.440]   Is what you have to call it.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.960]   - What did Google do?
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.960]   - Cito Vadnathian is trying to get his Googleization
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.320]   of everything and I saw him twer this morning
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.040]   that he had to add in the neutrality fail
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.640]   as he put it into his book.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.440]   He's constantly changing his manuscript.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.080]   - He should have submitted it a long time ago.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:13.920]   Now it's too late.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.040]   He's gonna have to change it every month.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.360]   Google's doing so many different and interesting things.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.040]   All the time, did you see the announcement?
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.720]   I think we missed this.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:24.240]   This week in Google happened the morning of the announcement
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.760]   that these new hands free commands.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.720]   Jake, do you use an iPhone or--
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.560]   - Your iPhone.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.480]   - And Jeff, we made you use an Nexus One.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.120]   - Oh, you got both.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.200]   - Look at that.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.480]   Well, I confess I've got both with it.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.520]   But that's only because--
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.200]   - I wanna see your stack of phones.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.400]   - Yeah, there's quite a big stack.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.480]   I got the bumper case.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.640]   This is the free bumper case.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.040]   They said it wouldn't come till September it came.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.480]   Can't believe they were charging 30 bucks
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.240]   for this piece of plastic.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.440]   Hard to believe.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.280]   Anyway--
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.200]   - It's very sleek though.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.440]   - It's pretty.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.640]   It's pretty.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.720]   And Apple bought Siri, which is a really cool application
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.840]   that lets you say things like book me a restaurant,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.160]   book me a dinner for two at Humble Pie or whatever.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.680]   But this new, I think the voice commands,
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.120]   unfortunately it's not in, you have to have 2.2,
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.360]   so it's really only a few phones,
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.640]   like the Droid 2 or the Nexus One that can do it.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.640]   But it's amazing.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.920]   - It is. - Press a button.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.200]   You could say note to self, it'll send you an email.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.640]   - What do they say, Leo?
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.360]   I think it's like 25% of search queries on mobile
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.400]   are coming from voice command in these environments.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.240]   - That's amazing.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.080]   - Some huge number I forgot what it was.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.160]   - So this is one way of responding to the change in search
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.040]   is to, you know, natural language,
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.960]   artificial intelligence, the ability to talk to it
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.840]   and ask it for what you want.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.680]   Like, hey, send me directions to the nearest Starbucks.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.520]   You actually can say, what is it?
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.240]   Directions to Starbucks and you'll find the nearest Starbucks
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.760]   and it'll open Google Navigate and it'll take you there.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.000]   That's pretty cool.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.640]   You could say play this week in tech
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.960]   and it'll play the podcast.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.480]   I think you say listen to.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.160]   So that's very cool.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.640]   And then they also unveiled,
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.920]   we've been talking about it on the show for a while,
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.960]   the Chrome to phone feature where you can book.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.200]   - And now phone to Chrome, both ways.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.040]   - Right.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.440]   In the announcement though, they said,
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.720]   I think this is the most important bit
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.880]   and wasn't really widely-brutant,
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.480]   but they announced 200,000 activations a day now.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   1.4 million phones a week.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.720]   That's five, almost six million phones a month.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   They have now sold more Android phones
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.000]   than iPhones in the past year
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.080]   and I'm sure they will eclipse iPhones soon.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.280]   - And we still have tons of devices coming out.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.760]   Dell's just came out last week.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   - The streak, yep.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.600]   - The streak.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.760]   Are you getting one Leo?
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.120]   - I should.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.360]   It's AT&T, which really demotivates me.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.840]   - It won't work with a T-Mobile Simmer now.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.400]   - It's sim locked,
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.240]   but I'm sure somebody will come up with an unlock
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.960]   at some point, but right now no.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.480]   You're stuck with AT&T.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.720]   - The streak is the slightly larger than an iPad.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.560]   - Five inches.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.480]   - It's not slightly larger, it's five inches.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.680]   It's the largest phone out there,
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.960]   but it looks pretty dorky, I'm sure,
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.000]   when you're holding this thing,
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.920]   the slab up to your head.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.360]   But I think that that,
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.880]   we were talking about this on this week in Google.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.720]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.560]   Denise, that looks good.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.160]   She's talking to her iPad.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.280]   We were talking about it in this week in Google.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.000]   That's the difference between Apple and Google.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.080]   Apple, you know, Steve Jobs probably,
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.800]   at some point there was a table
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.600]   with all different size screens for the iPhone.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.720]   You know, everywhere from two inches to 10 inches.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.400]   And Steve goes, "That one."
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.800]   And that's it.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.320]   And as you said, Jeff,
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.760]   the difference is there's still a table
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.880]   with all different sizes, but we get to say that one.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.080]   - Well, it's the same thing with Mac computers
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.080]   and Windows computers.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.160]   - That's true, but you use a Mac.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.160]   - Yeah, he's true.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.680]   - Yeah, admit the truth.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.000]   He's got a Mac, right there.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.840]   And an iPhone.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.680]   I think it's a little different in phones.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.160]   You know, I love Macs and I think
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.120]   that Macs are much more open than phones though.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.240]   The iPhone is so closed.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.520]   You can make a pretty strong case
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.200]   for the choice in the Android phone.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.480]   So what is obviously is happening
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.160]   is that the balance of power is shifting.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.800]   Android phones now are gonna be,
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:58.760]   what I'm curious about,
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   and your developer, Jake,
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.480]   I'd be curious what you say about this.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.520]   I wonder how long before developers start saying,
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.880]   okay, we're gonna develop for the Android platform first.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.560]   And then if we've got any resources left,
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.640]   we'll do an iPhone version.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.400]   How long before that happens?
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.080]   - I don't know.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   It's very different.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.080]   I mean, you have to almost completely make two different apps.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:19.040]   - Well, it's true.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.400]   I mean, Windows Mac, same thing.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.520]   - Right, exactly.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.840]   - So it's kind of like, I liken it to that.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.280]   And I think what's happening is you're seeing,
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.480]   maybe you might say,
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.840]   aesthetically, Android's not as good as a lot of Macs.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.640]   - Yeah, I think that's what people are waiting for.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.760]   - For it to be as good.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.120]   - Yeah, just ease of use and all,
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.760]   you can't find an ugly iPhone app, I think.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.640]   - Well, that's odd because people who buy phones
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   or buy are, it's outselling Apple phones, like two to one now.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.720]   - It's on all the carriers and you can get--
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.560]   - Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.920]   More people are buying it.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.920]   Hasn't the market spoken?
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.960]   - If you're locked into Verizon,
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.080]   then you have to buy an Android phone.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.280]   I've heard this all you mean everywhere on the internet.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.760]   - It's merely because they're,
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.400]   so you're saying Android's selling so many phones
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.160]   only because people are on AT&T.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.240]   - iPhone is one phone.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.240]   - You buy that?
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.000]   - I think I do, yeah.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.240]   That you have to make an affirmative effort to go out
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.960]   and get an iPhone, but if you're just picking up a phone,
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.000]   it may be an Android phone because that's just what you got.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.960]   - I'll tell you, if I'm a developer, I don't care why.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.600]   I'm just looking at 200,000 phones a day.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.880]   That's a new market, that's a big market,
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.320]   and it's growing fast, and I think it's obviously
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.400]   permanently outpaced the iPhone.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.320]   Do you think?
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.160]   Can Apple come back?
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.840]   What if Apple goes on Verizon in January?
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.440]   Is that changed it?
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.520]   - I think, yeah, I think so.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.040]   - That's the 35% of AT&T Apple users
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.400]   are waiting to go on Verizon.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.240]   - Yeah.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.760]   - Now, you say that, who knows?
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.080]   What can you add to the app?
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.520]   - All the Verizon users who are waiting to get an iPhone.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.160]   - That will be the test of your assertion
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.640]   because if it's suddenly available on Verizon,
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.720]   and then it says, oh, now we're gonna sell 150,000 more,
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.720]   then okay, maybe.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.560]   Plus it's more expensive though,
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.920]   you have to factor that in.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.680]   - It's the same, 200 bucks.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   - Well, they'll be pretty close.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.080]   - They'll be free Android phones.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.200]   - I think, I'm sure there are.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.640]   - Oh, you mean the iPhone's more expensive?
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:09.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.280]   - Don't you also have more risk with the iPhone
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.280]   that you go to all the stuff,
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.600]   or you make the app, and then Steve says, no?
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.440]   - Sure.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.280]   - Yeah.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.120]   - That's to me the risk.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.080]   I tried to get Lisa to bet me to come on,
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   and she says, we're not allowed to speak.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080]   (laughing)
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:23.920]   - At all.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.760]   - At all.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.600]   - Lisa worked with a company called Tap, Tap, Tap,
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.280]   to make, she's a photographer,
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.320]   been on Twitch many times, she's a great person,
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.640]   to make an application called Cam Plus.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.400]   This is a very cool application.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:39.160]   I have it right here, in fact, on my iPhone.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.560]   So you use it to retouch photos,
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.280]   to create different styles, it's a nice application.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.880]   So they released an update to the Apple Store
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:53.560]   that turned the volume switch on the iPhone
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.040]   into a camera button.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.440]   This is actually something pretty cool
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.760]   on a lot of Android phones.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.640]   A lot of phones in general, you have a camera button,
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.760]   not on the iPhone, it's a soft button, you have to press it.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.080]   And Apple said, no.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.040]   Read, look here, see the fine print,
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.760]   it says, in the developers agreement,
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.520]   you now may not, now shalt not,
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.320]   modify the functionality of the volume buttons, not allowed.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.280]   So they did not allow that app to come out.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.440]   - The app was still in the app store at that point.
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.840]   - This was an update to the app.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.000]   - Right, then the next revision, they hid the feature.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.760]   So what happened is exactly,
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.480]   they didn't, it was already in there.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.000]   They posted a tweet which was immediately redacted,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.840]   but too late, the internet, everything lives forever.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.000]   They posted a tweet that said, well, you know,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.360]   it is a funny thing.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:38.320]   If you go to Safari and you enter cam plus,
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:42.920]   what was it, camera phone plus, colon slash slash,
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.000]   enable shutter button,
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.560]   I'll get the actual URL for you,
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.520]   you can Google it, it's easy to find.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.720]   Oh, lo and behold, the original app, it turns it on.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.280]   I've got it right now, here watch, it's really cool.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.120]   I'll take a picture.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.480]   (laughing)
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.720]   So Apple, oh, I just took a picture of me, that's not good.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.560]   (laughing)
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:05.840]   Of course it is, Apple said, whoa,
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.640]   and they pulled the app off.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.720]   Well, we don't know, see, look, it just snaps it
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.520]   just like that, when I press this button,
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.400]   this is a very nice feature, but Apple's very clear
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.360]   that you're not allowed to do that.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.560]   I understand why Apple said that
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.920]   because it's confusing, right?
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   Their position, this is always Apple's kind of aesthetic,
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.880]   is no, a button does one thing in one thing, only.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.040]   If you make this button have two functions,
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.680]   people will be confused and we don't want confusion
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.800]   to reign the land of Apple.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.120]   Do it, it's like the mouse.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.360]   It's the mouse, it's the one button mouse.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.800]   So the nice thing on a Mac, you could just buy a new mouse,
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.400]   but you better not do that on the iPhone
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.520]   because we'll pull your app from the app store.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.520]   Now, I try to get Lisa to tell me whether it was,
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.040]   and this is, there's still a little question,
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.320]   was it Apple that pulled it?
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.560]   These guys at Tap, Tap, Tap are great marketers.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.040]   It could very well be that they pulled it
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.080]   to get the attention that they're getting right now.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.120]   - But same with that flashlight app a few weeks ago,
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.920]   that if you pressed a certain configuration of colors,
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.440]   it turned the tethering on.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.440]   - Turned on tethering. - Yeah.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.640]   - Apple pulled that one too.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.680]   - Well, obviously, yeah.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.200]   But this one's a little more innocent.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.000]   - Couple of things that are embarrassing for Apple in that.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.200]   First of all, their vetting process isn't
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.320]   and couldn't be perfect.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.200]   So if you can do that, you could probably put
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.760]   malware out there, spyware out there,
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.080]   it's completely possible,
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.760]   'cause you're not giving the source code Apple
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.360]   to bury stuff in an application.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.360]   That's obvious now.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.800]   So it's a little embarrassing Apple.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.800]   But also this issue.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.360]   Now, is Apple in the wrong in yanking this?
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.320]   Let's say, let's assume.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.760]   I don't know if Tap, Tap, Tap did it.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.920]   I'm gonna assume Apple yanked it.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.560]   Is Apple wrong in yanking the app?
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.640]   - Well, in their eyes, this app is the same thing
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   as the tethering app.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.720]   They're hiding a feature that Apple told them not to do.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.560]   At the end, they're just--
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.960]   - They violated the terms of service.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.400]   - So I guess technically, legally, yeah.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.920]   - But I understand they have the right to do it.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.720]   - What were they wrong to do it?
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   - They weren't wrong the second time to reject the app,
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.240]   'cause it was a hidden feature, but the first time,
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.560]   I think they should give their users a little more credit.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.400]   - Right.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.320]   - All iPhone users are not stupid.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.220]   They can understand that when the camera
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:02.120]   wraps up and the volume buttons do not change the volume.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.160]   - And as just my two senses saying in our chat room,
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.360]   look, if you were smart enough to find this cam plus colon
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.720]   slash slash URL and enter it in,
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.840]   presumably you're smart enough to know that you did it
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.080]   on purpose and that the volume buttons are changing
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.440]   their functionality only in this context.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.600]   So it seems to me that Apple could reasonably say,
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.600]   "All right, well, go ahead."
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.800]   - And if any other company would say,
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.440]   "Hey, listen to your customers, they want this button."
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.520]   But of course, Apple doesn't listen.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.840]   - No, so that's my point.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.960]   I guess that's just my point.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.080]   And tap, tap, tap, now it's interesting,
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.200]   'cause tap, tap, tap says, and I believe them,
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.440]   they've sold half a million dollars worth of this application,
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.860]   which means Apple got 30% of that,
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.900]   $150,000 in their pocket.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:47.420]   And so they're willing to turn their back
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.500]   on quite a bit of money.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.920]   - What would you say if Samsung did this?
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.780]   Or Blackberry did this?
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.620]   - I think they dank it.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.860]   I don't think Apple cares.
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.860]   I think Apple believes, and I think probably rightly so,
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:01:59.940]   that the keeper of the flame.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.540]   And if you're choosing the Apple platform,
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.560]   you're choosing that point of view.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.400]   Aren't you?
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.240]   - Yeah.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.740]   - That's, yeah, definitely.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.180]   - Do you need to say anything to say?
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.020]   - No, I agree.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:11.860]   - I'm just fondling her.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.820]   - Long live, I'm watching the chat on my iPhone.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.300]   (laughing)
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.340]   - We could get you, can't you see it on there?
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.340]   You on your iPad?
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:22.660]   - Well, there's kind of a multitasking issue with that.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.500]   - Oh, that. - 'Cause I wanna look
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.340]   at the story next step.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.180]   - Oh, that.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.020]   Oh, you can't multitask, huh?
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.340]   (laughing)
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:28.180]   Oh.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.600]   Yes, so two devices do the job.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.180]   - Seinfeld says he saw a study that found Apple users
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:39.100]   are more anxious about computers
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.580]   than other than Windows users.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.460]   So maybe Apple's just rightly saying,
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.260]   well, we don't wanna create any anxiety.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.940]   Another story from Apple,
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.100]   according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.820]   an Apple employee, a mid-level, not a high level.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.580]   Mid-level Apple employee was arrested on Friday
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.620]   for receiving $1 million in kickbacks
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.580]   from six suppliers to Apple,
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.780]   six companies in Asia that supply to Apple.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.620]   By the way, they published his name, so I don't.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.460]   (laughing)
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:10.500]   Accused, alleged, charged.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.100]   He was indicted by the federal grand jury
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.780]   for wire fraud, money laundering,
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.420]   unlawful monetary transactions.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.540]   And--
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:20.300]   - I'm surprised that Apple doesn't have controls,
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.180]   10 layers of controls, that would be impossible.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.260]   - Well, they caught him.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.100]   - Yeah, they did.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.500]   - And he only got a million dollars.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.300]   - It's gonna be a very expensive million dollars.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:29.220]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.940]   Apple said it began investigating him
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.220]   for a possible violation of corporate fallout policies
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.140]   found a cash of suspicious emails
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.660]   from his personal Hotmail and Gmail account
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.100]   in his company's laptop.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.900]   And they, boy, got him, red-handed.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:45.140]   - This would be one of our tips of the week on Twill
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.900]   where we tell people, "Don't do this."
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.060]   "Don't do this."
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.820]   - Well, yeah, just don't do it on the,
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.460]   well, either don't do it or don't do it on the company,
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.860]   laptop.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.580]   That might be the better advice.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.420]   - Yes.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.580]   - Mark Hurd probably could tell him a little bit about that.
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.420]   - Yes, the bit.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.780]   - Do you have any opinions about that?
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.620]   - About Hurd?
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.820]   - You know, it's interesting 'cause I talked to Paul Therrod
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:04.940]   who does our Windows show,
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.660]   who was a big fan of Hurds.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.380]   You know, Hurd came in and rescued HP.
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:11.020]   Carly Fiorina had pretty much dug a deep ditch for HP
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.020]   with a compact merger and a bunch of other things.
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.380]   And Mark Hurd came in, turned the company around,
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.260]   laid a lot of people off.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.900]   In fact, I saw his approval rating among HP employees
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.740]   was down like 34%.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:25.140]   Nevertheless, he's made the company very successful,
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:25.980]   very profitable.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:30.140]   I think it's the acquisition of Palm is very intriguing
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.540]   and perhaps a very good idea.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.900]   That was clearly his idea.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.300]   He really championed that.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.980]   And of course he was fired.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.580]   Paul thinks it's because HP is just basically kind of
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.700]   an old fashioned company.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:45.140]   He was fired because allegedly.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.060]   (laughing)
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.060]   - Reputedly reportedly.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:47.900]   - Reputedly.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.260]   Well, there is some debate about this actually.
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.140]   Allegedly, he fudged his expense accounts,
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.860]   not even for very much money, some say,
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.060]   just to have few tens of thousands of dollars
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.020]   to wine and dine a lovely young lady
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.100]   who happened to be an HP contractor
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:06.500]   put travel and so forth on his company expense report
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.860]   and HP said, well, you can't do that violation.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:10.980]   She had sued him for sexual harassment.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.980]   It's not clear whether he was fired for harassment
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:14.820]   or he wasn't.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.660]   - No, there wasn't.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.500]   The investigation found no problem there,
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.740]   but in the process of that, I understand,
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:23.740]   they found this, you know, illegitimate, allegedly illegitimate.
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:28.700]   - Well, maybe that was like Al Capone's violation
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:29.700]   of the tax code.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.220]   It was just a way to bust him.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.860]   - Well, but then the person who filed the complaint
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.780]   put a statement out.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.580]   - She was very sorry that he lost his job.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.220]   He should have lost his job and they settled
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.780]   and they settled personally, HP didn't settle with her.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.620]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.460]   - He resigned, didn't he?
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.300]   He wasn't fired.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.940]   He was going to be--
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:48.340]   - I'm sure he was forced to resign, yeah, by the board.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.180]   - So it's interesting.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.980]   - I think then complained to the board
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.260]   and publicly, the New York Times.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.540]   - Well, there's even some lawsuits now.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:54.980]   - Now, the lawsuits about it.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:58.220]   You wonder whether we've gotten two persnickety.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.980]   - Paul's opinion was, I don't know if you agree with this,
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.260]   it's just that HP's kind of an old fashioned company.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.500]   They're not a modern tech company
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.460]   that had it been Google or another company.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.500]   It might not have gone down.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.660]   - Was it an HP that was bugging reporters?
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.660]   - Yes, well, that's another story.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.500]   - They're a little over-centre person.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.460]   - But that was under Carly Fiorina, wasn't it?
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:20.220]   - Yeah, what'd they call that when they pretend
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.140]   to be somebody else, there's a name for it.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.300]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.580]   - Yes, and I'm liking on it too.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.340]   - But you know the chat room will know.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.460]   - They always do. - Pretexting.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.300]   - Pretexting.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.300]   - As fast as that.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.660]   - Who needs a brain when you have a chat?
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.820]   - No, the chat room is my brain.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.100]   Thank you, Brian and W.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.340]   Pretexting where they pretend to be somebody else.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:39.100]   Let's talk about Jenny.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.900]   I'm just a little bit but first.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.740]   - Jenny, Jenny.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:42.620]   - Jenny.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.460]   What's Jenny's number?
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.780]   Everybody knows.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:46.180]   8, 6, 7, 5.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.580]   I wanna mention a brand new sponsor on this show.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:51.620]   We're really glad to have them.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:55.580]   They actually, it's General Electric.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.140]   And they, we're doing a green tech show
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.740]   and we're really happy to have General Electric
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:04.140]   as part of our partnership to make the green tech show possible.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.340]   GE has something they call the $200 million
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:11.220]   eco-imagination challenge.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.860]   They are giving, I think this is so cool.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:17.180]   GE and its partners are giving $200 million out
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.820]   to ideas that help build the next generation power grid
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.180]   for the 21st century.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.860]   So if you go to eco-imagination.com/challenge,
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.580]   you can find out more about this.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.780]   They're making investments in three energy categories.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.420]   The first is renewables.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:35.980]   They're looking for better ways to integrate renewable energy
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.820]   into the power grid.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:41.820]   Of course, sun, solar, wind, water.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.900]   I was just on the Vanderbilt estate, an upper New York state.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:48.220]   This is a gilded age of states, beautiful,
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.020]   so gorgeous, beautiful house.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:53.700]   They, this is, they built it in 1898.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.540]   They were the first home to have bathrooms,
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.860]   not outhouses, bathrooms, running water,
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.860]   but they had, they put a water power station on the creek.
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.940]   This is at the turn of the century
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:11.980]   and the house had electricity from the, from the creek.
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.220]   It was like, this was like a state of the art house.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.660]   Not only do we have toilets, we have lights.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.140]   So we're getting back to the old ideas, I guess.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.180]   The second category grid efficiency,
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.420]   they want to convert the smart grid to digital energy.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.860]   This is, that's the new name.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.300]   The new term people are starting to use for smart grid
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.020]   to improve transparency at every step of the grid
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.100]   from power generation to consumption to reduce waste
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.940]   and to give consumers and energy service providers
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.180]   better choice.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.540]   Do you ever think they could choose your electricity,
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:42.940]   where it comes from?
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:43.840]   Push a button.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.700]   Their third investment category is eco homes and buildings.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.380]   GE says energy consumption is growing so quickly,
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.060]   it's creating an imbalance between demand and supply.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.340]   We know that.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.700]   That's obvious.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.180]   That's leading to higher energy costs,
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.980]   of course for everybody consumers and business.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.900]   So they want to change how and when we use energy
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:02.580]   to lower energy costs.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.540]   So you can enter this, believe it or not.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.580]   If you energy is eco imagination challenge,
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.980]   you'll have the opportunity to develop
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.580]   a commercial relationship with GE.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.060]   We're looking for entrepreneurs, business types,
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.380]   tech types, smart people.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.300]   GE will help you scale the concept quickly
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.180]   with their sales and distribution infrastructure,
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.820]   accelerate development.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:23.020]   They've got a lot of technical people that can help you.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.700]   And even secure investment,
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.020]   either from GE or their partner VC firms in Silicon Valley.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.780]   $200 million in this, this is great.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:35.500]   Go to eco imagination.com/challenge
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.860]   to learn more, submit your ideas and enter the challenge.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.340]   You can review, and this actually everybody,
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.660]   even if you're not an entrepreneur or an inventor,
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:45.660]   I want you to go there 'cause you get to look at,
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.780]   pull this up and review,
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:52.100]   the idea is already submitted.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.580]   Just click participate in the challenge.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.260]   So anybody can get involved.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:00.260]   It's eco imagination.com/challenge.
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:04.300]   They announced this the other day.
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.300]   In San Francisco actually,
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.900]   and I was gonna head out there
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.140]   and we have to get out of town.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.740]   Oh dear, I hope that's not the case.
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.980]   Eco imagination, eco imagination.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.860]   Did I spell it wrong?
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.660]   Eco imagination, no I.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.460]   Okay, so I have my entry.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.340]   There it is, it's coming up.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:29.220]   Yes, eco imagination, no I, I'm sorry, I said it wrong.
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.060]   Yes.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:30.900]   I have my entry.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.740]   Yes.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:32.580]   So down the road from here,
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.300]   there is a house that has a metal sculpture/windmill
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.100]   on top of it that's made out of a house.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.940]   Barrels.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.260]   Yes, I see that house every day.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.100]   It's like a guy.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.380]   The 101 freeway.
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.340]   Plant one on top of the twit cottage
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.020]   and it powers everything in here.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.580]   We've actually really been interested
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.940]   in figuring out a way to make this green and solar or whatever.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:52.100]   One of the things that we use,
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.540]   these are all LED lights and compact fluorescent lights.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.300]   So we use very little, surprising little power.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.980]   This is an antique helmet.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:02.020]   We couldn't power real lights in here.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.460]   So we try to do the best.
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.940]   You know what's great about the GE thing?
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.940]   I'm not paid to say this, you are so it's okay.
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:08.780]   I can say it.
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:09.620]   Yeah, you can say it.
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.780]   Is that, you know, I think it's where we need to go
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.100]   in all kinds of ways and it wasn't that long ago
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.220]   when companies would say, no, no, no, no,
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.340]   don't send us our ideas
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.220]   because we're gonna be liable
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.500]   if we open up a envelope
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.620]   and we don't wanna hear any ideas.
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.980]   And this is the way the world has to go.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.060]   And the fact that they're gonna invest a large amount of money
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.060]   in entrepreneurship and new ideas is where,
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:28.260]   it's a capitalistic thing.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.460]   I'm starting an investment fund at CUNY
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:31.460]   where I teach journalism.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:32.300]   Are you?
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.140]   In business models for news.
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:33.980]   That's great.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.820]   Looks like a lot of lawyers do a lot of pro bono work
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.820]   to figure out all the details and not do that.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.980]   But I think that that's what we have to do
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.260]   in industry after industry is we've got to invest
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.180]   in entrepreneurship and new ideas.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.460]   And so doing this and advertising it
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:50.460]   to a geek entrepreneurial technology audience,
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.300]   I think it's very smart.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.140]   - It's a great idea.
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.380]   They've got a Google map mashup here of
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.500]   where these ideas are coming from.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.460]   42 so far from Canada.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:01.140]   657 from the US 12 from Mexico.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.180]   They're from all over the world.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:07.180]   Algeria, Greece, Oman, Kenya, Singapore, India, Australia,
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:09.380]   the Philippines.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:10.220]   It's really cool.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.820]   1,107 ideas submitted so far.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:14.060]   You can vote,
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.980]   15,000 votes registered, 10,000 comments, 10,000 users.
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.020]   Join the Eco-Magination Challenge,
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.340]   ECOMAGI,
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:24.940]   natin.com/challenge.
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.860]   We do thank GE for supporting the Twit Network
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:31.300]   and for advertising on our new Green Tech Show.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.020]   We really have it fun with that show.
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.260]   - Which is also a good idea for a show.
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.380]   - Yeah, well we wanted to do it for a while.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.620]   And Sarah Lane and Dr. Kirsten Sanford,
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:42.180]   our science reporter, do the show.
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:43.820]   You can listen to it or watch it
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:48.620]   if you go to twit.tv/GTTGreenTech2Day
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.060]   and really having to have an apartment like GE
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.860]   really made it possible because it's expensive show.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:55.020]   It's pretty.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:58.700]   So who here fell for Jenny?
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:00.700]   And I meant fell for the story.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.540]   - Both ways.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.380]   - She's gonna cute.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.540]   - She was pretty cute.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.780]   - I admit it, I saw it on, you know,
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.500]   and this is the thing, you should know,
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.260]   when you see something on the chive.com,
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.020]   you should think twice, right?
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.020]   - They've done it before.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.300]   But we kind of wanted to fall for you.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.180]   I wanted to believe it.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.180]   - That's what was interesting in this case.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.380]   Even when we knew most,
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.220]   when the first word came on and said,
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.340]   "Whoa, guys, this is probably a hoax."
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.260]   We said, "Okay, so, so what?"
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:24.460]   We're gonna enjoy this anyway.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.620]   - So Jake, now come on, you're the young guy.
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.140]   Did you fall for it?
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.100]   - I did, yeah.
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.500]   - Everybody fell for it.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.140]   So tell us the story, who is Jenny?
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:35.060]   - I don't know much about it,
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.220]   but apparently it's a squirrel that quit her job.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:38.220]   - Or supposedly.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.740]   - Supposedly, quit her job.
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:40.580]   And you used--
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:41.860]   - Quit it very publicly.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.060]   - Yeah, and you used 30 pictures of her writing
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.420]   on this whiteboard to do it.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:47.620]   - She says, "I quit.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.500]   "I've learned a lot these past two years."
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.220]   And she's got glasses,
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.700]   it's pretty credible, right?
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.540]   - Looks real.
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.380]   - Great expression, so.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.220]   - I'm gonna miss you.
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:57.060]   - Yes.
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:57.900]   - She's white, boy, she an actress.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:58.740]   - Uh-huh.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.500]   - Except, I'm gonna miss you all, except one.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.100]   I'm looking at you, Spencer.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.160]   Being your assistant has been a special hell.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.700]   I put up with your temper and your bad breath.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:11.820]   You know why this resonates?
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.900]   Everybody's wanted to write these, right?
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.820]   - Yes, hopefully she'll inspire someone.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:18.380]   - On Friday, I transferred you a call.
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:21.340]   I was about to hang up when I heard you call me a hopa.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:23.180]   Hopa?
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.380]   Hopa?
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.700]   And then she defines hopa as hot piece of--
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:29.540]   (buzzer)
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.620]   - They had a little spelling error there.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.100]   - Hot, there was a big discussion about that.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.780]   On the internet people said, "You're being too literal."
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.660]   That's how I guess how it said.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:42.660]   See, she said H-O-P-A, but it's really H-P-O-A.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.660]   That's interesting.
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.900]   You'd think in a hoax, you would spell it right.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.020]   Is that really all you thought of me?
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.460]   Look how sad she looks there.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.460]   (laughs)
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.900]   Did you ever wonder why everybody in the office
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.180]   called the trash a garbage dispenser?
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.060]   That's a little--
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.220]   - That was a little, yeah, a problem.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.620]   - That should have been a red flag.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.460]   - Yeah.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.300]   - Right there.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.140]   That's a little Steve Carell.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:06.980]   - That was too convenient.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.340]   - Yeah, office Morales down since you installed
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:12.140]   the little office snitch so you could monitor
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.260]   how we spend our time.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.860]   This I believe, so I wondered,
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.860]   how does Spencer spend his time online?
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.740]   You gave me the codes after all four hours a week
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:22.580]   on Scott Trade.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.580]   It's supposed to be a brokerage right,
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.100]   so that's his real job.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.300]   Five point three hours a week on TechCrunch.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.820]   Incidentally, there's the giveaway.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.020]   - That was brilliant.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.020]   - This is the giveaway.
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.340]   - You knew they'd fall for it.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.860]   - They fell for it.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:37.420]   - So the little plug for TechCrunch.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.460]   This is where the Resig brothers showed
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.700]   they know what they're doing.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.540]   And-- - No, it does,
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:46.020]   if that had said five point three hours on Twitch.
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.260]   - I would have fallen for it.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.900]   (laughing)
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.820]   They missed a boat on that one.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:54.820]   And drum roll, 190, no, I'm sorry,
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:58.140]   19.7 hours a week playing Farmville.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.540]   This, by the way, if you think about it,
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.100]   half is work day playing Farmville.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.700]   It's not that compelling.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.060]   Even I, who was addicted to Farmville never is,
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:06.820]   I don't think, maybe I did.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.100]   - You need one big herd.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.340]   - If I get a message like this from Lisa,
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.740]   (laughing)
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.220]   Wow.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.900]   So this Hoppe, now, by the way,
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.100]   this is when I started to get a little suspicious.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:21.020]   She moves the whiteboard out of the way
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:24.620]   to show off what a Hoppe, she is.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.700]   - She also changes clothes.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.780]   - And suddenly, she goes from her blue tank top
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.980]   to a white tank top, throws away the glasses
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.500]   and she's wearing short shorts.
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.660]   So this Hoppe was moving on, although,
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:37.260]   and by the way, again, this is clearly calculated, right?
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.060]   I mean, it's obvious.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.580]   Why we fell for this, I don't know.
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.700]   Although I don't have another job,
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.660]   something tells me I'll be just fine.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:48.860]   So I saw this.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:51.140]   I came really close, but I didn't,
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.740]   to forwarding it to somebody and saying,
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:55.980]   oh, isn't this funny?
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.820]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.820]   - Didn't.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:58.980]   And I thank God I didn't,
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:01.940]   because Jenny has been revealed to be an actress.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.020]   - At least Porterfield.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.980]   - Yeah, in fact, there's a video now on the website
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.180]   from Jenny.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.020]   - Oh.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.140]   - Yeah.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:11.100]   They really, this is quite brilliantly done.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.580]   These guys, these brothers have done this
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.540]   before a couple of times, right?
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.900]   - What's great is they auditioned
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.860]   multiple actresses for this role.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.380]   They wanted a girl next door.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.220]   - Yeah.
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:21.380]   - Yeah, they got her.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:24.060]   - Well, and they hit on something that's a theme
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:27.020]   of your book, that anybody could do this.
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:27.860]   - Yes.
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:28.700]   (laughs)
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:29.700]   - Watch out, Spencer's of the world.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.540]   - Yes.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.540]   - This is the key device.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.140]   The key to virality though, is you need to tap
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:37.780]   into a commonly held emotion, preferably several.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.620]   Humor, pathos, anger.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:41.460]   - Right.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:42.300]   - Tim Street told me this,
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.100]   and I think he's absolutely right, this is the key.
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:48.740]   She does have a Twitter, of course, she has a Twitter account.
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:51.460]   She is official, Elise, ELY.
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.980]   - Her blog, her page is nothing much.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.380]   - And it's John and Leo Resig at thechive.com.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.140]   What was their other,
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.340]   they did a Trump $100,000, it was a $1000 tip,
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.060]   or some outrageous number for a tip.
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.620]   - Oh yeah, Donald Trump had a,
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:11.620]   had a, he tipped, yeah, huge amount on a $20 bill.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:16.700]   He'd done this twice, now credit goes to Peter Kafka,
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.020]   who writes the media memo, I think it was he who discovered this.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:19.860]   - I think he was the first one to say,
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.260]   just simply say, whoa, a lot of people.
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.580]   - Yeah, this is incredible.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.820]   - We like it, we know you wanna believe it, but.
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:26.860]   - And he did a good job.
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:29.940]   He tracked down thechive.com and who owned it.
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.700]   He said, oh yeah, it's the Resig's.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.340]   Before that, they ran a site called D. Rober,
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.620]   which features doctored photos of celebrities
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:38.620]   in their underwear.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.060]   (laughing)
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.100]   And it was at D. Rober, where in December 2007,
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.780]   where they had the story about Donald Trump leaving
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:48.180]   a $10,000 tip on an $82 bill,
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:52.340]   Fox News and the Post ran that story.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.900]   So Peter called him.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.780]   He said, he calls Leo Resig.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:58.660]   He says, Jenny's a fake, right?
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.980]   Resig says, Jenny's very real.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.340]   (laughing)
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:04.060]   This is good, I love the way they handled it.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:04.900]   - Yeah.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:08.460]   - He says, Jenny's with his brother John at this very moment.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.740]   The three of them are trying to figure out
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:11.860]   the best way to identify her and tell her story.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.860]   Jay Leno wants her on the show.
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:19.180]   Good morning America wants her on the show.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.580]   He says, we're not sure how to proceed.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:22.460]   We wanna be respectful of the girl.
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:26.700]   Now Peter doesn't give up.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.540]   He's a good reporter.
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.340]   I have to say, he really handled this well.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.820]   He says, okay, but you're the same guy
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.140]   as who gave us the Donald Trump story.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.020]   That was fake, right?
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.540]   Is this one different?
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.940]   Pause, good homework.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.740]   That was a good time.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.800]   Oh, so this is, so this Jenny story is real then.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.340]   This one is to be determined.
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:47.340]   People are kind of making up their own stories.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.620]   In other words, they hedge and they hedge.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:55.140]   Finally he says, since Leo won't tell me the story is real
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:56.380]   and the Trump story definitely wasn't.
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.420]   I'll assume this one is make believe too.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.060]   Quote, well, if you want to assume that you can,
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.060]   we have a track record.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:03.900]   True.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.980]   True.
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.140]   They claim the chive, the berry, the brigade,
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.300]   and the throttle, their four sites have a monthly audience
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:13.540]   of 5.6 million uniques.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.500]   The chive has 1.3 million uniques,
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.340]   according to Comms for.
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.460]   Have you heard the chive before?
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.300]   I never heard of it.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.060]   I have now, I think that probably was.
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:21.900]   They call it.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:22.740]   What was they were after?
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.340]   Yeah, the onion should buy them.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:29.460]   I don't know if it's onion-like or what, but it's--
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.340]   Sounds like it.
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.020]   And of course, what we love about the secondary story
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:36.500]   that everybody fell for it, including Tech Crunch,
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.300]   which ran the story.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.020]   And then--
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.020]   Who should hire a lease, by the way?
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.020]   Tech Crunch should.
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:41.540]   They should.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.060]   They should.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:42.220]   That would be smart.
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.580]   They need somebody for Tech Crunch TV.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:46.900]   I think they would be exactly the right person.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:48.420]   Oh, immediately, oh.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.020]   Huh?
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.180]   Maybe I should hire.
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:50.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:51.780]   No, I can't afford her.
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.660]   I can tell you right now, she's way out of my league.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.940]   Tech Crunch also ran the story, uncovering a lease's identity.
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.700]   So to their credit, they had both sides of this story.
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:02.220]   Oh, I get it.
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:03.260]   The chive.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.180]   It's like the onion.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.180]   Yes.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.980]   I get it.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:09.020]   Thank you, Chaterum.
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:10.860]   Apparently, they're on FARC a lot.
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.740]   So if I were a FARC follower, I would--
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:13.740]   Oh, OK.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.740]   Well--
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.260]   The chive.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:21.220]   Now we know Hoppe pronounced Hoppe but spelled H-P-O-A.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:22.340]   We now know what that means.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.660]   Chaterum, had anyone ever heard that before
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:25.700]   or was that made up too?
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.700]   I think it's made up.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:29.580]   I'd never heard anyone describe that.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.100]   All right, if anybody's heard of it, the chaterum.
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.420]   Chaterum, anybody before this?
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:33.940]   Hoppe.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:39.900]   Now, the JetBlue guys reel that, right?
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:42.740]   Yeah, apparently the story is not all as true as people.
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.260]   Really?
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.020]   There's more to it?
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:45.180]   There's sliding down the slide.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:47.140]   That's why the people are saying that he didn't get
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.500]   hit in the head and stuff.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.100]   Oh, really?
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.140]   He made up the thing about the lady swearing and all that.
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:56.940]   Most of my chatters say they've never heard of Hoppe.
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:58.260]   See, I think that's the other part of the story.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.140]   I think they even made up that.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:00.660]   Which is good.
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.500]   They made up an acronym.
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.500]   It's great.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.380]   And the kind of twisting it around probably
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.540]   makes it more legitimate, I think.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:08.740]   All right.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.460]   Well, I think we've gone through all of the possible stories
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.860]   that we could possibly milk.
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.860]   And I'm really glad you guys were here.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:16.700]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.700]   I tell you folks, it's wonderful to be in the cottage.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:19.860]   This is our first time here.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.140]   And I didn't even see any booze or anything.
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.460]   Well, somebody's been in my Balvani though.
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:26.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:30.540]   3D Leo is a big one to hold the whole class.
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.220]   Yes, I've got a rear.
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:34.220]   Jeff, barely though.
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.820]   Becky Worley says, I suffer from male pattern ass loss.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.140]   I don't know if that's true.
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:38.660]   I know.
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.860]   That's mean.
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:43.620]   Jeff Jarvis is, of course, at buzzmachine.com, which
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:46.300]   is a must read blog where he covers stories like these
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:47.740]   and many more.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:51.100]   And I think I always enjoyed reading it.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:54.060]   Really like the long form take you do on these things.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.380]   I know it probably doesn't seem like long form to you
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.860]   as a real journalist.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:59.740]   But for a blog, it's long form.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:00.380]   What are you?
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.740]   1,000 words usually are.
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:02.660]   Yeah, about that.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.180]   It doesn't how mad I get.
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:05.940]   I love it.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:06.540]   It's a column.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.140]   Most recently, internet Schmitternet.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.700]   That's the one where he talks about the Google Verizon deal.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.900]   His book, What Would Google Do is available in bookstores
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:13.300]   everywhere.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:13.900]   Look for the new one.
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.060]   Public Parts.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:17.460]   He's working on it right now, even
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.340]   as we speak.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.460]   Is Howard Stern going to blurb it for you?
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:21.460]   That'd be nice.
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:21.740]   That'd be nice.
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:22.540]   He's in it already.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:22.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.100]   It's a play on Howard's book.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:24.540]   It's a lot.
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:25.660]   Private Parts, obviously.
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:26.620]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:29.460]   And you're going to be at the IIIP.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.460]   PII in Seattle.
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:32.060]   In Seattle.
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.140]   About privacy in public.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.580]   Next week.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.660]   Next week, Jake will be in college.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:38.780]   Congratulations.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.300]   Thank you.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.860]   Working hard, studying hard at Ware again.
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:44.060]   University of Rochester.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.420]   University of Rochester at the Rode piece from Happy.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.420]   I'll have to get you two together.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:49.100]   What's the mascot?
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.940]   Bumblebee or Yellow Jacket.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:51.460]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.780]   You better get that right.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:54.620]   That's not used very much.
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.740]   You better get that day out.
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:56.740]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.820]   Same with Abby's school.
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:00.460]   It's like, I don't even know if they have-- they must have
[01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:02.060]   a mascot, but I don't.
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:03.260]   I'm sure the chess team.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.620]   The chess team, exactly.
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:06.540]   Jake, thanks for being here.
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:09.220]   Jakejarvus.com.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.820]   And of course, it's so nice to have Denise Howell in the studio.
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.700]   We very, very rarely get to see her.
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:17.420]   She is usually home where she hosts this week in law
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.740]   every Friday at 11 a.m.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:23.100]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time and live.twit.tv.
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.700]   Her blog is bagandbaggage.com, but she also
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.860]   writes the Logarithms blog.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:30.620]   L-A-G-L-A-W-G.
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:30.940]   Get it?
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:31.940]   Law.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.460]   Law.
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:32.940]   Yes.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:33.460]   Law.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.260]   Corithms blog on the ZD net.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:37.260]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:40.420]   This show is live every Sunday afternoon
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:45.900]   at 3 p.m. Pacific 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:46.740]   We do everything.
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:50.660]   Almost everything we do on Twit is available live on the live.twit.tv
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.020]   channel.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.620]   And then packaged up for your consumption later,
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.740]   should you want to listen after the fact,
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:58.620]   you can go to the website, twit.tv, to find the shows.
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.340]   We do a daily-- if you like Tech News,
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:03.780]   daily-- a wonderful daily Tech News show with Tom Merritt.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:05.380]   Formerly, I've seen that buzz out loud.
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:10.060]   He does Tech News today with Becky Worley and Sarah Lane
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:13.540]   and Hackfives, Darren Kitchen, a lot of great people.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:17.340]   That's every Monday through Friday at live.twit.tv.
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:21.620]   The show pre-show begins at 2.30 Pacific 5.30 Eastern time.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.580]   And of course, you can always chat in our chat room.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.220]   That's 24/7 now.
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:28.180]   irc.twit.tv.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.420]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.020]   Anything else I should plug?
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:31.580]   Anybody else--
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:32.580]   Google.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:33.820]   Oh, that's right, Jeff.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:37.220]   And I do-- with Gina-- the wonderful Gina Trapani
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:38.540]   this week in Google, all about Google.
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:39.620]   And this week, I think we're going
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.500]   to try to get a Googler on, at least Kevin Marks,
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.260]   an ex-Googler, and if not, Chris Dibona as well on Wednesday.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:47.780]   We do that show at 1 p.m., right?
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:49.100]   1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:49.780]   I'll be watching that.
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:50.500]   It'll be really interesting.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.660]   Yeah, yeah, it's fun.
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:54.020]   And I love this week in law.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.820]   I've always wanted to do the show because we talk about legal issues
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:01.180]   so often with so little regard for the actual truth.
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.620]   It's nice to have real lawyers talking about it for--
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.740]   What's great about the internet and the whole Twit Network
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.820]   is you can do a whole show in the law, which
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:08.940]   is just going to go in the old world.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.900]   Well, for me, this whole thing is in reaction
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:15.420]   to mainstream media, which I labored in the vineyards of six-minute segments
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.300]   for 20 years.
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.420]   And so it's so nice.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.660]   And that's why the show's so long because I just can't stop.
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:24.500]   I love the opportunity to surface people like Corinne McSherry from EFF,
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:25.580]   who was on our last show.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:26.260]   Oh, she's great.
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.500]   We get wonderful law professors to come join us.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.300]   And you just don't get access to these people in your daily life.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.620]   So it's nice for us, nice for you, I hope.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:35.860]   It's really great.
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:36.420]   Thank you, Denise.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:37.020]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:37.660]   Thank you, Jake.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.780]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.660]   We'll see you next time on another Twit.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:41.460]   Is it the game?
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:47.460]   Oh, I forgot to play the video, the Fiesta Video Darn Nation.
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.180]   We had a guy.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:48.860]   I should find it.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:49.620]   It's pretty funny.
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:52.980]   The guy sent us an email, a YouTube video.
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.140]   Hi, Leo.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:57.420]   I just wanted to thank you for your great board commercials.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.980]   And one of the reasons it is it's basically
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:04.260]   I purchased a new 2011 Ford Fiesta.
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:07.020]   One of the reasons was is you keep on talking
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:08.740]   about that wonderful Ford Sync.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:12.780]   And I was waiting for the day when a car would come out.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.780]   That it's a car that I wanted from Ford that would have Ford,
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:17.780]   I think.
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:20.860]   And so I bought one, the 2011 Ford Fiesta.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.180]   Yes, I bought a magenta, actually the same car
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:26.060]   that you picked the Ford Flex.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:30.060]   And I just thought it wasn't that far.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.140]   Two, which grandpa firewall?
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.140]   Round the board.
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:39.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:43.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
