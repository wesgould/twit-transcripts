[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.040]   It's time for Twit, the show that covers all the technology
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.360]   news.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.160]   And boy, I'm having fun already.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.760]   And we've only just begun because it's kind of a tech TV
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.200]   reunion today.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.400]   First, let me welcome to the studio Mr. Jim Lauterback
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.800]   of Revision 3, the CEO over there.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.840]   It's good to see you, Jim.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.720]   It's good to see you, Leo.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.800]   Jim, what were you, editorial director at tech TV?
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.360]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.280]   Vice president and editorial director, something like that.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.720]   Yeah, I was there at the start, as you were.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.680]   At the very beginning.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.920]   As you were.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.800]   Yeah, the good old days.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.640]   And also joining us from--
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.120]   are you in San Francisco from San Francisco?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   Yes.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.480]   Kevin Rose, who also started a tech TV as a little tech guy.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.880]   That's right.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.400]   I got your coffee for you every morning.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.320]   No.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.080]   Sugarous and cream.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.800]   Yes.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.480]   Filter fresh.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.840]   Never.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.960]   But Kevin did make his breakout on the screen savers
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   when he discovered a bug in Microsoft's Windows.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.000]   Was it--
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.360]   It was that messaging system that they had.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.960]   Net send or whatever it was.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.920]   Net send, yeah.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.000]   And he told us, we contacted Microsoft.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.960]   They said, it's not a bug.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.560]   It's a feature.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.440]   So we said, well, Kevin, why don't you talk about it
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.640]   on the show?
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.720]   And the rest, as they say, is history.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.440]   He became the dark tipper.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.720]   Then on--
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   Oh, geez.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.880]   Then I got a drink to that.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.680]   And then on to bigger and better things as the CEO of Dig.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.280]   And also, Dig Nation, the show on Revision 3
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920]   and System and other shows.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.520]   Dig is having a big rollout.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.560]   So we're going to ask you about Dig Forward.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.240]   And you can tell us what you can tell us.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.720]   But--
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.320]   Cool.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.720]   No more.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.360]   I won't put you on the spot.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.680]   Also, your former co-host from the screen savers.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.960]   And I'm very pleased to say our newest hire at Twit Ms. Sarah
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.520]   [CHEERING]
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.320]   Hey, everybody.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.480]   So great to have you.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.920]   And Sarah joins the team June 1st, Tuesday.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.120]   We're going to be doing a couple of shows with you,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.960]   The Green Tech Today Show, which you and Kiki will host.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.920]   And you and I, I'm so pleased.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.760]   We haven't done a show together in five years.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.040]   I'm so excited about this.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.280]   I wasn't kidding in my blog when I talked about iPad apps
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.640]   poolside.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.080]   So you've been playing with the iPad.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.520]   We're going to do a show called iPad Today,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.000]   Sarenile Host That.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.760]   And you didn't have an iPad, so I had to give you one.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.800]   Yes.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.920]   And it's great, because I'm like the first one I know who
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.120]   has the 3G, because everybody else just got the first one.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.120]   So I'm kind of a cooler person.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.600]   I love my iPad.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.680]   Maybe unhealthily so.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.480]   Have you played--
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.680]   Have you played Wii rule yet?
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.080]   No.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.480]   It's like Farmville for the iPad.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.840]   Do not.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.520]   I won't.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.480]   I don't like Farmville at all.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.280]   I spent like $100 on that game.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.640]   You play-- oh, that's right, Kevin.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.560]   You do play Wii rule.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.040]   And that finally brings us to our other new hire.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.640]   Does this mean I'm not the newest now?
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.360]   You're not the newest.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   I'm not the newbie anymore.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.640]   He's the second newest hire.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.520]   And it's Tom Merritt, who's show Tech News Today,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.920]   launches on Tuesday with Becky Worley.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.440]   Yes!
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.920]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Miss Sarah Lane, Monday,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.720]   and Friday.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.240]   So excited.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.120]   And Dr. Kiki joining us most Thursdays.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.520]   So--
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.960]   This is exciting.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.920]   Yeah, it's going to be fabulous.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.760]   I'm so happy about this.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.240]   We got some special guest booked for the first week.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.920]   Some folks you might know from other shows
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.360]   that I've done, but no scene at employees.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.000]   They don't get too freaked out.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.040]   But yeah, I'm looking forward Tuesday at 230 Pacific,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.480]   530 Eastern.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.280]   Check it out.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   We've been putting a lot of blood, sweat, and tears
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.640]   into getting ready for this thing.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.280]   So I can't wait to actually get it going.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.480]   I was looking for a woman who was as macho as Molly Wood.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.360]   And I think Becky qualifies.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.480]   They both played rugby.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.080]   They're both toughest nails.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.000]   I strongly opinionated.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.840]   Can replace Molly Wood, but I'm very, very happy to have
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   Becky.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.040]   Yeah, I'm really thrilled.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.320]   That's a woman who knows some stuff.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.880]   However, she is not a treacherous little ball of steel
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.200]   like Sarah Lane is.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   No, no, no.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.720]   Vice?
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.200]   I wouldn't take Becky.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.120]   I would not take Becky.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.800]   No.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.920]   I tried to take Becky.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.040]   She took me down two out of three.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.680]   I mean, I'm treacherous.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.840]   I'm with people like this.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.440]   I wouldn't go do that.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   No, Becky is tough.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.840]   Becky was the first producer of the screensavers and call for it.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.480]   Call for her.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.800]   She launched both those shows.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.920]   And she and I had an interesting symbiotic relationship.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.480]   She was in my ear for many years.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.320]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.960]   I'm looking forward to both everybody.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.000]   So exciting.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.520]   That's so exciting.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.040]   You always at Tech TV, you would always give Becky right of way.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.240]   She was like the steam ship coming through that you had to just move to the site.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.760]   Well, Tom, I think you sent us a list of people you'd like to work with.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.000]   Sarah was one of them.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.920]   But you said, and here's like the long shot was Becky.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.720]   Yeah, Becky was near the end of the season doing the ABC stuff.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.640]   I was like, ah, we can't get her.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   We got Becky.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.640]   That's awesome.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.040]   Well, it's a testament to you.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.200]   And I'm just really excited.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.520]   So watch out, Jim.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.040]   Yes, solid lineup.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.880]   Here comes Twit.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.200]   What are you hiring me?
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.400]   Anytime.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.760]   Door is open.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.200]   No, you know, we've actually now officially outgrown, as you can tell,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.760]   because you're in here, outgrown not only the studio,
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.800]   but the entire building.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.360]   And I think the next step very soon is going to be to move to a larger studio.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.680]   I appreciate the IBM PS2 3286.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.720]   You gave me a look at the computer.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   That's going to be--
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   Hey, it was mine for years.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.920]   What, Sarah gets an iPad and you get an old IBM?
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.120]   You already had an iPad.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.280]   He wanted Windows.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.560]   I wanted Windows 286.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.280]   Yeah, that was my request.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   You know, did you know that we're actually just across the 20th anniversary of Windows
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   3.0?
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   Right.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.280]   Last week.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   It's insane.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.520]   Do you-- Kevin, you don't even remember Windows 2.0.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.200]   Listen, I-- so my first version was 3.0, but I have Windows 1.0 sealed in box in the
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.320]   Computer History Museum down next to Google.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   I mean, that's yours.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   That's your copy?
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   It says, "On loan from Kevin Rose."
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   Ha!
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   I'm in the face.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   Where did you get it?
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   I bought it off the eBay.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.360]   Believe it or not, like about maybe five or six years ago.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.760]   I remember Kevin before you.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.320]   I guess you-- before you gave it to the Computer Museum, you had it in your house, like, over
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.720]   in like where your tea was.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   And I picked it up and you were like, "What the hell?"
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   It's in the box.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   She rolled it.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.520]   You don't know why you're holding it up and trying to install it.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   No, no, no.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.520]   You didn't just move it.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.520]   It's seeing a life.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   What's this?
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.520]   It's like a man's gift.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.160]   That's like an original job of the hut in plastic.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   You don't want to mess with that.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   Right, exactly.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   You see, it's on the shelf.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   You don't touch it.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   You don't touch it.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   You've got to sit every once in a while and that's it.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.920]   I remember my thesis in grad school on Windows 1.0 when it was in beta.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   I remember you telling me--
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   I had that.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.600]   The most amazing thing about Windows 1.0 was that you could open up 16 copies of the clock
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.120]   without crashing the computer.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   16.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   And that was the test.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   That was the test.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.680]   That was the test.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   I had Windows 286.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.480]   That IBM PS2 is actually sitting upstairs.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480]   I brought it in.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.480]   It's mine.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480]   It's mine.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   It's mine.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   And I had Windows 286 on disk that I loaned to Kevin Reno.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480]   Do you remember him?
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   The IT guy?
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   He still has it.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   He says, "It's in my garage somewhere.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.680]   I'll get it back to you."
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.160]   So Kevin, I'm still waiting.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.720]   Actually that PS2 is a chew toy for your dog because you're planning to bring in, right?
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   That's right.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.680]   Chango's going to be chewing on the PS2.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.080]   So a lot to talk about this week.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.960]   And actually, I think you all will have something to say about the Facebook press conference.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   They had this week.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.640]   Mark Zuckerberg said, "All right, all right."
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.840]   He seems like the kind of guy who-- maybe like me too-- thinks it's easier to ask forgiveness
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.840]   than to ask permission.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.680]   I remember working with you.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.240]   So basically what Facebook keeps doing is they keep changing their privacy policy and
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.720]   then the users keep complaining.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.720]   And then Facebook says, "Oh, my bad."
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.960]   And they changed it again now to there's three big buttons that let you kind of default
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   it.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.080]   But they didn't do the thing I would have liked them to do, which is make everything private.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.080]   And then you opt in.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   You choose.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.960]   Was that going to happen, Tom?
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.800]   No, because Facebook wants to give you as little privacy as possible.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.680]   But the less privacy you opt in to--
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680]   That's really the issue.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.640]   The more money they make.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.960]   And so they're bowing to pressure here by saying, "Okay, we've had enough beating up
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.440]   in the press and from our users we need to adjust this."
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.920]   But they're going to adjust it as little as they think they can get away with.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   Right.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920]   Why do you think it's tied to money though?
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.760]   Why do you think it's the more money they make, the less private?
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.960]   Well, and you know, you're closer to this kind of business model than me, Kevin.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.600]   So maybe I have a misimpression.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.200]   But it seems like the more information they have in their database to sell to advertisers,
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   the more money they make.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.840]   And so it's in their interest to encourage you to try to allow some of that to be public
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   so that they can monetize it.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.120]   Well, it's more than that though, isn't it?
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.920]   I mean, they want to be like Twitter.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.000]   Isn't there a little bit of Twitter envy, Kevin, that they say, "Oh, look how easy it
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   is for Twitter."
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.120]   All the different ways Twitter could monetize its user base that we can't.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.680]   So I think there's a couple things going on.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.440]   So I'll say this and try-- I'm not name-dropping or anything like that, but I happen to--
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   No, you know, Zuck.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.640]   I went out to dinner with him like a week and a half ago.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   And we were chatting.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.240]   I was like, "Hey, so what's going on with the privacy stuff?
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   Blah, blah, blah."
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.000]   And his point to me was that what they're really pushing for is that he doesn't want
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   to become stale.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.240]   And the way that he looks at it is that the world is evolving into more social sharing
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.360]   of information.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.760]   The default is now more public sharing.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.360]   You know, he sees us with Twitter with a bunch of new startups.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.440]   And he's like, "How can I continue to evolve and embrace that stuff and hopefully make the
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.520]   experience better for the user?"
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.640]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.560]   We talked about one of their features they have called instant personalization, which
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.880]   is basically what it does is as you go out and you fan different things-- let's say you
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.040]   fan like different bands that you like, things like that-- they can provide third-party websites.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.680]   They will pass to them your user ID so when you visit that site, they can go in and pull
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.040]   only the public information about you.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.920]   So anything that a search engine could pull, that anybody else could pull.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.080]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.920]   If you were to go today and you land on Pandora, you would actually get a custom experience.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.000]   Even though you hadn't logged into Pandora, Pandora would go out, talk to Facebook.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   It's weird.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   It's weird.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I agree with you.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I agree with you.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   But hold on a sec.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.240]   So it says at the top, you know, you can opt out, blah, blah, blah.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.640]   It goes in and pulls all the public data that any search engine would be able to get.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.400]   And then they bring in automatic recommendations of using a started plane for you.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.920]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.560]   I said to him, I'm like, "Ah, that feels kind of weird, blah, blah, blah."
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.040]   And I think he knows everyone thinks it's a little bit weird, but he doesn't want to,
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.080]   his whole thing is it's really an experiment.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.960]   And they want to continue to push the envelope.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.480]   I don't think he's coming at it from like a super greedy or like, "I want to make more
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   money."
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.520]   I really think that's the best.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.560]   You know what it feels like to me?
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.320]   This is the problem is that Facebook was private to begin with.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.200]   Facebook made a promise to me.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.640]   We'll keep it private unless you say otherwise.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.360]   You tell us who you want to share it with.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   Facebook was the promise.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.920]   And I feel it's like a friend that I went and I told something secret to and then he
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.920]   blabbed it.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.440]   And then he said, "Oh, my bad."
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.240]   So I go back, I said, "Okay, I understand you made a mistake."
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   He blabs it again.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:41.920]   So the reason you feel that is because they walked you through that wizard that essentially
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.640]   said like default to public, right?
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:50.320]   The initial promise was 100% private and they changed it in such a way that even I couldn't
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   figure out.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   I mean, even Zuck couldn't figure out.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   His own pictures were published.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.920]   You know, and he said, "Oh, nobody would mind that."
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.920]   That's the problem.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   That's the problem.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.440]   It's really in my mind.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.280]   It's not the fact that he wanted to try all this stuff and it's even not the fact that
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.640]   he wants to default all new users to public because if he does want to do that, that's
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.640]   fine.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.840]   If you start fresh but don't call it Facebook, you don't call it Facebook.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   You call it something else.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.800]   You say, "We're going to do Facebook Rev 2 where everything's public."
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.480]   But it's too late to do that with Facebook.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.480]   That was the promise.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.080]   It's still true that he makes more money the more information is made public.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   That might be as incentive.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.440]   But I'm willing, who knows who people is intent.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.880]   I hear what Kevin's saying about that may or may not be what's really driving things.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   I think that's right.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:39.280]   But if it wasn't, then we'd be able to opt into all of the stuff, not be opting out.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   That's my question.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   That's my question.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   Why doesn't Facebook just say it's private unless you say otherwise?
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.480]   Kevin, why don't they do that?
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.280]   Here's the strategy behind the scenes.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.480]   This isn't something he told me.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.000]   This is something that I'm drawing the lines between everything.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.920]   The public data is very useful data.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.840]   I have to say that they're going to monetize the actual pages.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.600]   The idea that they can do, once data is public, you have with Twitter with all the data being
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.080]   public, you can do things like extrapolate trends out of that.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.960]   Real-time trending information about news articles.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.000]   You can do more real-time search.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.880]   There's a bunch of things you can do.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.000]   If Facebook ever wants to get to the world of real-time search, they're going to need
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.160]   all this data to be public.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.480]   They can't take all people's private data and use that to fuel a real-time search engine.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   They have to have public data.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   It should be a strategy.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   What are Facebook's spokesman?
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   Yes.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.080]   That's one thing that on Twig that we were talking about with Jeff Jarvis and Judith
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.920]   Apone, Jeff said, "Well, why doesn't Facebook, actually it was Jay Rosen, said why doesn't
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.760]   Facebook have an ombudsman, a public face?"
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.800]   Part of the problem with this is that Facebook hasn't explained itself well, that Mark
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   isn't really great at explaining this.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.040]   Elliot Shregg is worse.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.960]   So it's a PR problem as much as anything else, right?
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   Absolutely.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   For sure.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.320]   Like you said earlier, Leo, the options have to be clear and you have to be anyone.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.280]   My mom should be able to go to Facebook, go into the privacy settings and understand
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.000]   exactly what's going on.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   That is not the case.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.840]   Well, this new thing, though, do you think it's made a step in that direction?
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   It seems a little bit--
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   I haven't played with it since it was a lot.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   Yeah, it's not rolled out yet.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.680]   Of course, I don't have a Facebook page to try it, but that's right.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   Because you really did delete your Facebook page.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   I am going back.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.320]   To be honest, I feel like this is a bad girlfriend who three times now has revealed
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.600]   stuff that I said, this is secret, and I'm not going to give her a fourth chance.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.040]   I just don't think it's right.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.640]   Well, and you know what's interesting is a lot of people say that, oh, you know, if
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.320]   you're younger, if you're in the 20s, you're more open, you really don't care about all
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   these issues.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   But even if there's that, the young people have a different point of view about that.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.040]   But you know what, I was chatting with a guy over the weekend who used to work at Common
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.660]   Sense Media, just left, which is a media company that helps parents talk to their kids
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.960]   about all this stuff.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.420]   And they've done research recently that shows that as people are getting older in their
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.360]   20s, they're starting to become more and more concerned about the data that they're sharing
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   to lay online.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.240]   Well, but they are drunk pictures are already out there.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.240]   You know what?
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.040]   They're going to start deleting their Facebook accounts as well.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.920]   The idea that it's just a bunch of old people that are worried is not necessarily true.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.960]   I saw some posts like that about some of that research that said, actually, it's the young
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.280]   people who are more concerned with the privacy issues.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.940]   They're more concerned with the fact that stuff that they made private isn't become public
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.940]   without their knowledge.
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.060]   You got to share something to really share here.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.540]   Go to youropenbook.org.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.540]   This is a scary site.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.780]   This is a scary site because it uses the Facebook API and allows you to search public
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.260]   status updates for things like what I just did, cheated on my boyfriend or they have
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.820]   a bunch of suggested searches too.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.420]   That's also a really dumb update to make.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:47.080]   Well, that's what I tell kids.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   I tell my kids.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.960]   If you went to their strip club, maybe Facebook is just a terrible place to talk about it.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   To join that.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.220]   I tell my kids, if you put it on the internet anywhere, Facebook or anywhere, think of it
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.220]   as public.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.220]   Don't put anything on the internet.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.660]   You wouldn't want friends, family, teachers, future employers to see because unfortunately,
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.560]   there's no way of guaranteeing this with bugs and so forth.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.620]   Aaron says, I just cheated on my amazing boyfriend.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.980]   He did not deserve it at all.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.620]   Poor Aaron does not know that this is public.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.740]   Little does she know that it's also going out on a major podcast and everybody's seeing
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.740]   it.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.660]   Or even something like hate my job, which is what I'm searching for now.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.660]   People put that up all the time.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.500]   But your future employer is going to see that.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.500]   Exactly.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.500]   Or your current employer.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.500]   Or your current employer.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.060]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.060]   It is scary.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.740]   I spent some time with this site and I feel kind of dirty having done it, but it's scary.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.420]   Well, what is interesting is this using this is using APIs.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.420]   It's been published.
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.420]   This is published.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.420]   This is all public information.
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.140]   And so that's my problem is a, normal people can't figure out what's public and not.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.660]   B, they aren't willing to say, okay, everything I put here is public.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.180]   Facebook's much more useful if you're willing to put secrets in there.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.980]   And C, I don't feel like I can trust Facebook to do the right thing.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.980]   I think they made a big step.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.940]   You know, one of the things they did today this week, which was really good, is they
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:09.340]   gave you one button click to get out of that whole application, that whole Pandora thing.
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.260]   But you know, Facebook is so useful to people that it's going to be hard for them to quit.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.940]   I think that's really part of the bottom line is.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.260]   I think the positive thing from last week is that Facebook said, you know what, we're
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260]   changing these settings and they're going to stay that way.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.700]   We are not going to flip it again.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.140]   That's the biggest violation that they had done.
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.780]   I think other stuff is excusable for this reason or that.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.820]   Other people may disagree with me, but changing something that you had selected to be private
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.740]   to public was inexcusable.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.380]   And I'm glad that they made that clear like we're not going to do that.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.340]   Kevin, you're kind of in the same boat here because dig is from what I've seen on the dig
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.660]   four stuff that TechCrunch published is moving towards a more public facing Twitter like
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.660]   thing.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.980]   There was an accusation in the Wall Street Journal that you might be giving information
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.980]   to advertisers.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.420]   That's completely bullshit.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.620]   Like that was, I don't know how they got that wrong, but yeah, I second I saw that in
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.620]   the journal.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.740]   I went and called our ad salespeople and I must have freaked you out because that's what you
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.740]   don't like.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.220]   I've never heard of this and I called them like, no, no, no, they have it wrong.
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.220]   All of law.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.820]   And so yeah, that was wrong.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.700]   But as far as, but you understand what's going on at Facebook because you have the same kind
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.140]   of things that you need to know.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   Dig has never been private.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.140]   So you don't have that.
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.140]   Everything.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.940]   Everything submissions, comments, digs, everything that you do within the site has always been
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.940]   public.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.940]   So you don't have to worry about that.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.860]   You don't even have a setting to go private.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.780]   So you can't even set it there if you want to.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.780]   Right.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.100]   I have to say, when I looked at that video, I was at leaked out.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.100]   What happened with that?
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.820]   Was that something you intended people to see?
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.060]   I had a feeling it was going to because we created a video that we wanted to send out
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.060]   to publishers.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.420]   And we sent it out to about a couple hundred different publishers.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.420]   Including TechCrunch.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.140]   Yeah, TechCrunch got my hands on it.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.140]   You must have known.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.140]   I mean, come on.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.140]   No, no, no, no.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.100]   We knew absolutely it was going to go out.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.740]   That's why I wanted to make sure it was a polished video and it wasn't like some hacked
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.340]   together screenshot or something like that.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.900]   I mean, it's going to happen.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.700]   So yeah, basically it was announcing some of the new features that we'll be rolling out
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.980]   in a couple of weeks when we go live with Alpha and I'll come back to give you a demo
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.980]   while it's going to go.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.780]   You have promised that we will get the first live demo.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.780]   For sure.
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.540]   I have to say though, and I'm not saying this because to blow smoke because you're a friend,
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:16.780]   but I really think that this is exactly where Digg needs to go, I will use Digg much more
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.780]   because of it.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.780]   Thank you.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.620]   Can you kind of, I don't know how much you want to talk about it, but can you kind of
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.780]   in a nutshell sum up what this change is?
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.780]   It makes it more like Twitter.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.780]   Sure.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:32.300]   I mean, I think that, you know, when we look at Facebook being kind of semi-private and
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:37.060]   public and really you're not following tastemakers, you're more following your friends.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:42.740]   And then we look at Twitter, which is completely open and public, but you get a little bit
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.740]   of everything.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.380]   So if I'm following Tony Hawk, I get not only escape-boarding links, but status updates
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.180]   that say like I drop my kids off of the park, which really I don't care about.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.540]   I want Tony Hawk's cool skateboarding stuff.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.340]   So we look at Digg is this kind of place where we can be a little bit more of like just news
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.540]   and links, right?
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:04.620]   So the ability that one click spreads that story to all of your followers that you have within
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.620]   Digg.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.900]   The ability to auto submit stuff.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.620]   So if you have a podcast, if you have a blog, you can claim your feed, your RSS feed, and
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.260]   the new story objects will come in with a title description and one dig automatically
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.740]   and go out to your followers.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.180]   And then when they dig it, it's kind of like a retweeting away, but a little bit more
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.180]   efficient.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.180]   So it's a single button and then it goes out to all their followers.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.540]   So it's a really efficient way for links to spread around throughout the Digg ecosystem.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.900]   And it really gets away from, you know, we've always had this one front page that when people
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.980]   get on the front page of Digg they say, wow, this is awesome.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.100]   You know, I got a ton of traffic, but you know, only 120 or so stories per day actually
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.140]   make the front page.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:44.180]   So this is a way for us in creating that way for a dig equal spread to your friends
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.020]   for it to actually gain a lot of traction without even having to make the front page.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.580]   And of course, if it does get enough traction, it'll make the global Zeitgeist front page.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.820]   But it's a lot of stuff we've needed to do for a long time.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.900]   You know why I like this and before I was at revision three, I was at PCMag, I ran the
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.820]   websites editor in chief, we would always there first there was the slash dot effect
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.540]   where you try and get your story on slash dot.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.500]   Then there was dig where you work really hard to get on the front page of Digg.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.300]   And if you did, it was a home run, but you work really, really, really hard for that
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.620]   one home run and everything else would get like this.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.660]   And this, if it works, which I'm pretty sure it will, these guys are great, will allow
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:25.620]   you to have many more stories that maybe won't get as much traffic, but we'll really start
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.380]   getting really, really good traffic.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.380]   Is that right?
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.100]   Kevin where it's, it's not like a couple home runs and everything else is going to be really
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.100]   small, there'll be a lot of sort of mid range hits.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.860]   Yeah, so exactly.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.700]   And that's what we're looking forward trying to really service kind of the long tail of
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.980]   content so that, you know, if you come in and you're really into knitting and you dig
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.940]   in knitting article and it spreads to your knitting followers, then and it spreads without
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.540]   that little community inside of dig, you'll get all that traffic.
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.980]   Whereas that's where we would never normally make the front page of, you know, dig today.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.100]   You know, I take full credit for this.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.420]   I just want to let you know this was my idea two years ago.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.460]   You probably don't remember Kevin, but I said the only problem with dig is I don't care
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.340]   what 90% of the diggers think is important.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.180]   I want to follow what the top, my friends think is important.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.540]   I want to see what they dig.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.940]   I want to see what Jim and Tom and Sarah and Kevin dig.
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.780]   And I asked you, I begged you, I said, there's got to be some way that I could say just these
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.900]   people, their digs.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.380]   And that's really what you've done.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.060]   That's what's coming into, we're calling it my news.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.060]   It's like the new default.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.700]   You should call it Leo's, but okay.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.700]   We'll call Leo news.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   Yes.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.700]   Would you please?
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.380]   I'll be a little icon in the upper.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.540]   And I do want to point out that in the video, you are following only one person and it's
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   me.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.100]   That's right.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:44.980]   So but now this to me is exact is all dig needed to do was let me choose whose digs I
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.660]   pay attention to that gets rid of all the kind of background noise for people I don't
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.700]   care about who are digging up the top 10 ways to, you know, whatever.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.860]   And it's like Twitter where I follow exactly who I want and I get their links.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.220]   That's what's really valuable about doing Pounce help you with this at all Kevin.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.540]   I mean, did you bring any of lessons over?
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.540]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.380]   I mean, each one of these whole things, I mean, I've made a ton of mistakes at dig and
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.380]   Pounce and you name it.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.380]   And I think that, you know, that's the fun thing about starting new companies.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.700]   You always learn something new.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.300]   So there's little bits in Pounce that are making their way into this.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.180]   Actually, we follow the Twitter directly that I created a lot of that technology on how
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.340]   we rank suggested users in categories.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.420]   A lot of that's going to be built right into dig.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.420]   So yeah.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.420]   So I'm going to get a t-shirt that said dig for it's my idea.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.420]   Right.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.100]   It was my idea.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.260]   So this is out in a couple of weeks.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.140]   Yeah, the alpha is going to go live in about two weeks.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.140]   All right.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.140]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.780]   This is to me, when I looked at and watched that video, I said, that's exactly what I
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.900]   want from a dig.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.060]   And it will be so much more useful.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.620]   In fact, it will be kind of how I use Twitter.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.460]   And it's something that I'll use a lot more, I think, than not to blose again, not to blose
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.300]   book, but I'm really pleased with these changes.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.420]   Keith is just getting your friends to use it.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.940]   Once you've got that going, then it becomes incredibly useful.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.940]   Right.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.700]   Well, in fact, I was thought it was funny that whoever did that video was following me because
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.820]   truthfully, I don't dig a lot of stuff.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.500]   So that really isn't going to be a very, wasn't going to be a very active feed.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.100]   But now it's going to be much more active feed because I will, absolutely.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.420]   Well, and also, as people create content, it's great to be able to serve your own RSS
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.220]   feeds into it and have it show up there.
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.220]   And so I think you guys will do really well.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.660]   Revision 3 will do really well with that, too.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.660]   We'll put our stuff there.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.260]   It'll be kind of a little friend feedy in that sense, huh?
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.260]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.340]   We've got feeds for different things that we don't even expose to anybody.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.500]   And I'm putting like clips from Dignation or clips from Tekzilla.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.740]   And I'm putting that stuff up there.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.940]   That'll be great.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.140]   So we didn't mean, I didn't mean to turn this to a big ad for Dig 4.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.140]   Sorry.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.140]   I hate Dig 4.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.140]   There we go.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.140]   We get to bounce.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.260]   No, but since we got you on, I think it's good to ask you about it.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.660]   And we will get you back when you're rolling out.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.060]   We'll be the first demo.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.060]   Full demo.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.060]   That's exciting.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.300]   Thank you, Kevin, for doing that.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.420]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.540]   We're going to come back with more tech news.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:04.300]   I know you all saw Sex and the City, and we'd love to get your review of that.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.900]   Did you see it?
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.900]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.820]   I didn't pay money for my ticket, though.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.900]   I was at a premiere thing in New York.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.340]   So that's even more fun.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.540]   Well, that would have been a little different.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:26.820]   Does it disappoint you to know it wasn't shot in Abu Dhabi, but instead in Morocco?
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.500]   No, I think a lot of things are shot in, you know, Vancouver.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.700]   And Abu Dhabi refuses to screen it.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.180]   I've been to Abu Dhabi.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.260]   I know Abu Dhabi.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.740]   And Morocco is no Abu Dhabi.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.980]   And we just say that about this.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.260]   You know, I think Roger Ebert said it's one of the worst movies ever made.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.100]   Oh, I loved his review, by the way.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.260]   It was so funny.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.260]   I just loved his review.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.260]   I think he said something like these people make my skin crawl.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.300]   And it's, yeah, well, Sex and the City fans will like it.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.300]   My wife loved it.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.620]   And there's a character named Rickard Spurt.
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.620]   Right?
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.620]   Dick Spurt.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.620]   Rickard Spurt.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.620]   Yep.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.620]   So that just shows you.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.620]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.620]   There you go.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.620]   The writing was up to snuff, wasn't it?
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620]   Up to snuff.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.620]   IP freely.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620]   Yellow River.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.620]   One of my favorite novels.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.620]   Exactly.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.060]   We want to take a break and talk a little bit about Squarespace.com.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.220]   I think half this panel uses Squarespace.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.900]   I know Kevin does, I know Sarah does, I know Tom Merritt does.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.900]   Yep.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:27.900]   I use it for forecast podcast.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.100]   I know we do for our InsideTwit blog.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.140]   Of course, we all got it for free.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.420]   But let me tell you, it's worth paying for.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.420]   Not made for mine.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.420]   Did you?
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.420]   I hope you used the Twit coupon code to say.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.420]   I use somebody's code.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.420]   Somebody's scam one or two.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.180]   That's the problem is that we all have codes.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.740]   I would just ask those of you listening today to use the Twit code just for old times'
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.740]   sake.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.380]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.380]   We all love Squarespace.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.380]   And there's a good reason for it.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:59.420]   If you go to squarespace.com, you will see it's not, it's hard to describe.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.100]   It's not web hosting exactly, although it is web hosting.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.660]   And it's not software to do a blog exactly, although you can do a blog with it.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.740]   What it really is, is the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.340]   It's a way to design and maintain and run a website that never has to worry about the
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:21.020]   dig effect because they're virtual private server technology that makes sure you have
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.780]   enough bandwidth whenever you need it.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.340]   You never have.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.340]   It does work, doesn't it?
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:30.180]   Yeah, I've had a couple of my blog stories on there on dig and it handles it.
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.180]   No problem.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.180]   It's beautiful.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.740]   They have a, if they just, Tony just flips a switch.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.900]   He goes down to the basement.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.220]   He says, flip the Kevin switch.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.580]   And it has a big red button.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.580]   Big red button.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.100]   Dig, dig, dig.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.380]   Great social integration with Twitter and Facebook and all the social sites, an iPhone
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.580]   app that is the best blogging app ever.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:55.260]   Plus you can import and export your comments and blog posts from mobile type WordPress
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.420]   type pad and bloggers.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.660]   So you know, you never stuck at Squarespace.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.860]   Incredible statistics, beautiful templates.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.420]   The best thing to do if you want to know what you can do with Squarespace is go to
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.540]   the examples section of the website and look, there's Clayton's blog.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.860]   I mean, there's just so many great sites, Sordin Lasers on here too.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.860]   Yes, Sordin Lasers there.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.860]   Yep.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.860]   Yep.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.860]   Just beautiful sites and you know, they don't look like you.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.060]   When you see a WordPress site, you go, oh, that's a WordPress site.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.620]   When you see a Drupal site, oh, you go, that's a Drupal site.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.940]   I defy you to look at any of these sites and say, oh, that's a Squarespace site.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.100]   They all are unique.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.580]   They're all beautiful.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.500]   If you know CSS, of course, there's no limit to what you can do, but you don't have to.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.100]   You can just drag and drop the templates to make gorgeous, gorgeous stuff.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.820]   You see the new stuff coming out and they show you the sneak peek stuff, Leo?
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.740]   Yes, Kevin.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.380]   I'm sure they know what.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.380]   Tell me.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.380]   I haven't seen it.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.380]   Oh, it's going to be cool.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.380]   It's really cool stuff.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.380]   Really?
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.380]   Yeah, I can't really shoot.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.380]   I probably shouldn't have said anything.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.380]   Oh, no, no, that's exciting.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.620]   Because the beauty of this is if you're a Squarespace customer, you get it all automatically.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.260]   Yeah, there's no, that's one thing I like about Squarespace versus WordPress and the others.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:04.540]   You don't have to worry about upgrades and hackers, like your software is out of date.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.940]   They just do all the upgrades for you.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.220]   They hosted all the upgrade, all the keep it in perfect shape for you.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:14.580]   Starts as low as $8 a month for the basic account for the huge massive package.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.380]   $50 a month is it.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.220]   And by the way, if you use the coupon code, you get 10% off for life.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.060]   $30 a month for the business package.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.460]   I mean, it's just a really, really fantastic.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.460]   Squarespace.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.460]   Self-healthy.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.660]   So you can use that 10% off for a long time.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.780]   Oh, that's true.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.620]   The longer you live, the more you say.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.620]   That's right.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.620]   I hadn't really thought about that.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.220]   There's a reason to live forever.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.420]   I'm getting 20% off Squarespace.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.900]   I can't die.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.580]   Wine helps your heart, right?
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.420]   So it's got poi fusse.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.420]   Sarah's drinking.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.540]   We are drinking a lovely pass of Robles.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.860]   I mentioned that already.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.860]   I'm repeating myself.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.340]   I have another class.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.860]   I totally interrupted the money phase of that commercial.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.220]   No, we don't need money.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.220]   Money.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.220]   Who needs money?
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   Squarespace.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.220]   Squarespace.com.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.220]   Y'all learn.
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.220]   You'll learn.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.220]   You'll learn.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.220]   You kids.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.220]   You'll kids, you'll learn.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.220]   Let's see.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.220]   We've got a great cast of characters.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.940]   Let me just run through it one more time in case you just tuned in.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.740]   Of course, Tom Merritt, our newest employee, he's going to be starting his tech news today
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.740]   on Tuesday.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.180]   Should I keep the beard for tech news today?
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.180]   I like the beard.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.180]   I like it.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.180]   It's cool.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.180]   Really?
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.180]   Everybody seems to like it.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.060]   It's even though he's older than me.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.540]   It helps the lighting.
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.540]   It helps the light.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.540]   It gives you reflect as much.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.540]   You're awfully white.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.540]   You don't get as shiny as a beard.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.540]   He's so white.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   He's so white.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.300]   I wish I could grow a beard.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.300]   You can't grow a beard?
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.300]   What do you mean?
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.300]   What do you 18?
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.780]   No, I had somebody like it was like she goes sideburns and so I've been trying to grow
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.140]   them for like three months and nothing's there.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.140]   Really?
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.140]   That's three months.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.140]   That's terrible.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.140]   I know.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   Jim Luddaback has been camping for the last week.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.140]   Now, when I come back from camping...
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.140]   What can you tell?
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.140]   I haven't shaved.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.140]   I have three days.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.860]   There's nothing there.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.780]   Sarah's got more of a beard than you do.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.940]   Sorry, that's mean.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.940]   Sarah Lane is also...
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.340]   This is a screensaver's reunion.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.020]   This is how we treat each other.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.020]   We did treat each other.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.020]   We never had wine at Tech TV.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.820]   We would just do the show straight.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.820]   Yeah.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.820]   Maybe Starbucks.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.820]   You never had wine.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.420]   Well, there was wine that was...
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.100]   Sometimes Hetikila shots out of Brantano's trunk.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.100]   What?
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.100]   I had to kill him.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.340]   You started without me?
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.940]   Because I know that after the show we'd go to the slow club.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.940]   Slow club, J&B.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.940]   Well, you know what?
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:30.460]   The best part was on Fridays after John Devorak would do Silicon Spin, he would bring everybody
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.580]   over and start buying wine at the slow club.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.580]   That was the best.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.580]   Oh, man.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.580]   But you guys were still doing screensavers.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.580]   We were staying advantage of it.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.580]   We were stuck there.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.580]   Yeah, we couldn't do it.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.580]   And by the time you guys got over, we were...
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.580]   We caught up on this.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.580]   We would do the Tequila shots to catch up with...
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.580]   Exactly.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.580]   Or the lemon drops.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.580]   I think there was a lemon drop phase.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.580]   Lemon drops.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.580]   Remember the lemon drops?
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.580]   There was a lemon drop phase.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.580]   I do remember...
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.580]   You drink lemon drops.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.580]   Kate Batello.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.580]   I...
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.580]   I'm my...
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.580]   I love lemon drops.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.100]   I love lemon drops.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.300]   I love lemon drops.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.380]   And slow club had brilliant lemon drops.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.380]   Come on.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.100]   What was the hamburger with the applewood smoke bacon?
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.100]   Oh, that was good.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.100]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.100]   A business though.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.500]   And now is the slow club still there?
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.500]   Are they gone?
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.500]   Slow club is still there.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.500]   Yeah, J&B is still there.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.500]   J&B, I was just...
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.500]   That was...
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.500]   That was...
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.500]   That was...
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.500]   That was...
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.500]   That was...
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.500]   That was...
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.500]   That was...
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.500]   That was a lot of...
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.500]   I won't say his name.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.500]   Oh!
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   It's got...
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.500]   Well, who do you think?
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.860]   It's got to be Simon, right?
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.860]   Simon Kidney's.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.860]   It wasn't Simon.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:29.860]   Dave Chon.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.860]   Dave Chon.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.860]   It was...
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.860]   Okay.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.100]   I can name that cameraman in two notes.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.100]   Okay, it's time.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.100]   It's time.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   It's time.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.100]   Good times.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.100]   We were all a lot younger.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.100]   A lot dumber.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.060]   Forget Sadie's flying elephant.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.060]   And we're Sadie's popcorn.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.060]   It's not Sadie's anymore.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.260]   It's not Sadie's anymore.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.700]   You guys never asked me there.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.940]   Was that in LA after you all went to G4?
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   No, it was a fun...

[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:27.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:28.940]   No, it was a fun...

[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:32.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.940]   No, it was a fun...

[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:52.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:55.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:03.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:05.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:06.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:10.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.940]   No, it was a fun...
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:26.940]   No, on an Android...
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.940]   Did you say "fandrite older man"?
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.940]   She said "fandrite older man".
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.940]   Kevin, "Kevin, the wheel like that".
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.940]   Kevin, "Shbaba".
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.940]   Kevin, "Shbaba".
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.940]   [laughter]
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.940]   As far as the evil goes,
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.940]   the face is beautiful,
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.940]   and at first I thought,
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.940]   "Wow, you know, the display is a lot bigger than the iPhone,
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.940]   and that's the first thing that you notice."
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.940]   But it's kind of like...
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.940]   I don't know, it feels too big in my hand.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.940]   Yes, I have...
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.940]   That's what she said.
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.940]   [laughter]
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.940]   All right.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.940]   Shoot me, I'm so sorry!
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.940]   Of course you need me to drink more wine.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.940]   Oh, my God, I can't believe I did that.
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.940]   That was just awful.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   That is what she said.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.940]   That is what she said.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.940]   But that is...
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.940]   [laughter]
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.940]   That was so awful.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.940]   You don't get jokes like that on "Dig Nature".
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.940]   I'm sorry, it was just wide open.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.940]   I know, fine.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.940]   I actually like those kinds of things.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.940]   You were thinking it, is that it?
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.940]   You know, Leo, something I've been thinking about a lot about the Evo,
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.940]   so why do you need Internet access if you have an Evo?
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:30.940]   So hear me out.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.940]   You live in a Wi-Fi or some sort of LTE environment
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.940]   or whatever it works on, Wi-MAX,
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   and you buy this and you have unlimited data.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.940]   Why do you need Internet connection?
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.940]   Why do you need to pay somebody else for business?
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:44.940]   No!
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.940]   In fact, if I had 4G,
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.940]   I wouldn't because for 30 bucks a month,
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.940]   this tethers, not even tethering.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:50.940]   It's a Wi-Fi access point.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.940]   Right.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.940]   So there's a way to get the tethering for free if you have 4G.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:55.940]   So check this.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.940]   If you live in a 4G area, you can set it to tether...
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:02.940]   Or, I'm sorry, you can set it to be a hotspot without having to pay extra.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.940]   Well, that's exactly it.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   Because the...
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.940]   And Sprint has said, "Look, we made a mistake.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   If you live in a 4G area, you can do that."
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:09.940]   We're gonna change that.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.940]   We're gonna change that in a while and you're gonna have to pay.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.940]   But for now, you're gonna prefer...
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.940]   I just want to point out that the Nexus 1 with Android 2.2
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.940]   does that for free.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:16.940]   But it's not Wi-Max.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:17.940]   It's T-Mobile.
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.940]   The thing is, and my brother lives in Seattle, okay, or Tacoma.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.940]   And he is an LT.
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.940]   He's a clear wire customer for his home internet access.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.940]   Why bother?
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.940]   And he is looking at buying an EVO.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.940]   And I said, "John, the thing you can do is if you buy the EVO,
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.940]   you and your wife both get an EVO."
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.940]   You know what the problem is?
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.940]   When he goes to work, then there's no more.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.940]   Internet access.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.940]   It doesn't matter him and his wife.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.940]   They both buy one.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.940]   They're the only people in the house.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.940]   Right.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.940]   So Sarah, I don't want to preempt Sarah's review of the EVO.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.940]   But you're of the EVO.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.940]   It's the T-V-E-V-O of the EVO.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.940]   But I agree with you.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.940]   We're really seeing, and I think it's somewhat because of Google,
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   a real change in how we think about our phones and how we use our
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:56.940]   phones.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.940]   Now Sarah, yours is poorly from a user point of view, right?
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.940]   Definitely.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.940]   So what is it too big for you?
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.940]   What don't you like?
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.940]   So it's, I'm a happy iPhone user.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.940]   So I'll preface anything I say with that.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.940]   And that, I guess, does kind of make me a bit biased.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.940]   Well, I was a happy iPhone user for one.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.940]   It's heavy.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.940]   It's heavy.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.940]   The screen is, it feels clunky big.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.940]   It's beautiful to look at, but it feels clunky big.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   And the touch keyboard is so ugly.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.940]   I mean, that thing is ugly.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.940]   I don't know how anybody could say any different.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.940]   I find it hard to type on.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.940]   I think it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.940]   important.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.940]   I think it's a very, very important thing.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.940]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.940]   And that is that anyone that has used an iPhone before,
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.940]   and then they go and move to Android,
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.940]   they notice that it's not quite as polished.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.940]   So when they start playing with the menus,
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.940]   they start playing with the keyboard,
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.940]   they start playing with the way that the apps interact with each other.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.940]   They look for the options.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.940]   It's not quite from a usability standpoint.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.940]   It's not quite there.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.940]   And so you get this phone and you're all excited because it looks cool
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.940]   and you hear great things about the Android OS.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.940]   And you're like, "Ehh, where's my Angry Birds?"
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.940]   Like, I just want the awesome apps that are on the iPhone.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.940]   Angry Birds, really?
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.940]   Oh, have you played Angry Birds?
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.940]   I played on the iPad, but yeah.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:38.940]   It's amazing.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.940]   See, I think one of the advantages of an iPad is I have all those apps
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.940]   and then I still have my phone, right?
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.940]   There you go.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.940]   Is it just that the UI is better or is it partly just because it's different?
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.940]   That's what you're used to.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:51.940]   And you're used to the iPhone.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:52.940]   I think the Android UI is better.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:53.940]   I'll be honest.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.940]   You know what's going to be really interesting is the guy who did the danger
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.940]   and who went over to Palm.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.940]   Or now, he just went to Google.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:02.940]   Yes.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:03.940]   This is the guy who did the great...
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.940]   I mean, I consider the danger, which ends up, which was the sidekick,
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.940]   to be one of the best photo-esses ever.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.940]   We gave it the best...
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.940]   Yes, at one point.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.940]   When it first came out.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.940]   Like, 1992?
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:16.940]   It was more like 2000.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:17.940]   Thank you.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.940]   Thank you, Kevin, for that.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.940]   But this guy...
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:21.940]   It's all pixelated.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.940]   It was the best.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.940]   It was the best.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.940]   He could do it the time, Kevin.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.940]   And he's now going to Google, hopefully, to do a good job with these Android things.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.940]   I want to see what he's going to do with Android.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.940]   So do I.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:33.940]   What's his name?
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:34.940]   He was at Palm.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.940]   He was the guy who did the recent Palm OS.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.940]   Apple's got Johnny Ive.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.940]   That's all they need.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.940]   Yeah, you know.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:41.940]   Johnny Ive.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.940]   He's the...
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.940]   He's hard to cool.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.940]   He does do a good UI.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.940]   Man knows.
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.940]   It's funny.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.940]   Even the story on the Internet doesn't say his name.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.940]   It just says "the man who did Web OS."
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:54.940]   Nobody in the chat?
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:55.940]   I got it.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.940]   Nobody knows his name.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:58.940]   Mattai...
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.940]   Oh, that's why.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.940]   Mattai Estuarte.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.940]   Nobody wants to say his name.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.940]   Mattai Estuarte.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.940]   He went to Google.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.940]   He went to Google just this past week.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.660]   I don't know if I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.300]   I think Google, frankly, is where it's happening right now.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.300]   This is where...
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.300]   Now, I don't think...
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.940]   I haven't seen the iPhone, the next iPhone, and I bet you...
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.940]   I'm going to buy one.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.260]   I bet you all love it.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.100]   This is just good news for everybody.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.780]   It makes Apple work harder.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.780]   It makes Google work harder.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.540]   I think Google has an advantage because it's the same advantage Microsoft had over Apple.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:33.300]   Multiple handsets and a faster iteration of hardware and software.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.460]   That makes a big difference.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:39.900]   It's almost like we're seeing 1990 played out again with Mac and the Windows or 1984.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.300]   Well, it comes down.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.860]   Did you read Virginia Heffernan's article in last Sunday's New York Times where she said
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:50.340]   apps are the suburbia of the Internet.
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:57.180]   She said the free and open world wide web is essentially like downtown where anything
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.700]   goes as ads, as scummy people.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.700]   China town.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.700]   It's dangerous.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.700]   It's China town, Jake.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.700]   Forget it.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.700]   Forget it.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:09.300]   And she said, "But apps have become the suburbia, the place that you go."
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.300]   It's the strip mall.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.300]   It's a little nicer.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.100]   It's a little cleaner.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.580]   And so...
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.260]   But it has the same problem where if you have everybody leaving the city, the city goes
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.260]   to hell.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.540]   You're stuck with these apps.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.540]   And I think this is the problem.
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.780]   I think we're seeing a fight now between open and closed.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.780]   Open...
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:26.780]   You know, it's messy.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.780]   It's dirty.
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.780]   It's not...
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.780]   It's got little issues with the UI.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.780]   But closed is dangerous in the long run.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.420]   That's what I would submit.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.060]   Yeah, I can see that.
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:40.300]   I can see a good parallel there of Apple's App Store and Android's App Store for that
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.460]   matter being like the strip mall where you get individualized...
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.460]   Get porn!
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.220]   ... sanitized choices that are very easy to get to.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.220]   You get on a lot of free ways.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.220]   I see, yes, yes.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.700]   But Apple's especially not so much Android.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:57.340]   But you're not going to be able to find the chalk that gets rid of the ants or the weird,
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.660]   you know, ethnic food or any of the cool stuff there.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.220]   What does everyone keep mentioning porn?
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.100]   Like, who really wants to watch porn on their cell phone?
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.100]   Like, is that the people really...
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.220]   Show of hands in the chat room.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.140]   No one's going to admit it, but I'm sure they're out there.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.140]   On their cell phone?
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.140]   Yeah, why not?
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   You know what?
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.140]   Best screen available.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.340]   If you have the urge and the only screen you got is that screen, it's your best screen
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.340]   available.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.500]   I'm with Kevin.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:25.980]   I mean, I'm on my phone when I'm on the go and I'm not...
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.260]   That's actually a good point.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.580]   I don't know what was going on.
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.660]   Steve is the one who keeps bringing it up, right?
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:37.180]   I mean, I like porn, but not enough to, you know, watch it and upset people on uni next
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.180]   to me.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.180]   No, I think you're right.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.180]   I'll have a good filter.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.180]   It's not porn.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.540]   You know, when Steve talks about porn, I think he's talking about those silly, like, the jiggle
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:50.060]   app that makes people's body parts jiggle and stuff like that.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.060]   It's...
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.060]   You're right.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.060]   There's not...
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.060]   I mean, porn on the iPhone is a joke.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.060]   At least that's been my experience.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   But...
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.060]   What is this?
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:00.900]   There's some serious work going on on the iPhone.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.300]   It's very small.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.460]   I can't quite make it out.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:08.460]   It looks like two people are doing something, but I don't know what.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.460]   Oh, wait.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.460]   I'm at an open source code check.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.300]   This isn't porn at all.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.300]   This isn't porn.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:19.900]   No, I think you're right, Kevin.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.540]   That is kind of a red herring.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.540]   Yes.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:27.940]   However, it's the point though.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:32.860]   And maybe that's what if Ben Steve is that anything goes.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.780]   And he likes the idea of making a nice...
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:39.060]   It's a boutique versus a bodega.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.940]   It's a gated community.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.940]   It's exactly what it is.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.660]   I thought it was a little bit of a stretched analogy, but I think it does make a good point.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:51.580]   And I think she says at the end, we may regret this flight to the suburbs.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.260]   I feel in my gut.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.100]   I don't haven't thought out the logic to justify this yet, but I feel like that's a little bit
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.100]   of an overreaction.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.100]   I don't think it...
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.900]   I think that's stretching the metaphor a little too far because I think that the only
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:02.900]   mutually exclusive is...
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:03.900]   It's not mutually exclusive.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.500]   The open source applications that we have will continue and they'll continue to get good.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.660]   It's just that on the phone, we may be missing out on the opportunities that we would have
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:12.660]   had.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.140]   Perhaps we'll kill open.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.740]   No, I don't think so.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:20.380]   I think open is too much of a force of just how people use the internet.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.740]   It may dampen it, but it won't kill it.
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:28.540]   Well, you know, do you want a Nintendo 64 or do you want a full fledged PC, right?
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.540]   As the model for what you do on your phone.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:34.020]   I mean, the great thing about the Nintendo 64 was everything just worked, but...
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:38.340]   Man, by the way, Nintendo was the first company to say we're not going to let the junk games
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.340]   on the Kildotari.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.340]   Exactly.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.780]   And it did well, but now we've got the Xbox, gaming on the PC.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.500]   Oh, but the Xbox and PS3 still have that Nintendo model.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.500]   Exactly.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.660]   We vet every game.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.460]   And I think people do want that for their phone.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.300]   The problem is that I think there's a hybrid here that I mean Apple could easily say,
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.420]   "Okay, listen, if you want to be in the App Store, if you want to get revenue through Apple,
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.460]   you have to go through the approval process."
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.460]   Right?
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.100]   If you don't, you can still install your apps on people's phones, but you have to have the
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.260]   installation process happen via the web.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.860]   Like, you'd click on it just like you would, download and install any other application.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:17.020]   Well, the trouble ends up being for Apple, where they do things like they're doing with HTML
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.420]   5 and Flash.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.060]   And whereas we saw this week, a couple of big broadcast networks saying, "Screw you,
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.060]   Apple.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.940]   You're not going to let Flash on your device, so what?
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.940]   We're going to keep using Flash when you're not going to HTML 5."
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.940]   That might be a mistake.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.580]   That's a mistake for Apple.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.580]   It's a mistake for the companies.
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.580]   I think it's a mistake for Apple.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.580]   I think it's a mistake for the companies.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:33.580]   I think you're both right.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.580]   I do think for both right.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.420]   I think it's a mistake on both parts.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.420]   It's crazy.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:38.420]   It hurts every point.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.420]   It hurts every point.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.420]   It hurts every point.

[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:36.420]   Is there a hazing that goes on when you are in the face?
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.420]   I think Tom and I are like the same age, aren't we?
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.420]   You're not old.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.420]   Leo's the old.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.420]   Tom's much older than you, Sarah.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.420]   That's very nice of you to say he's the same age, but Tom's much older than you.
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.420]   I'm like twice your age.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.420]   He's twice your age.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:48.420]   No, come on.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.420]   No, Tom's closer to my age and your age.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.420]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:53.420]   That's not right.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.420]   You might be right.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.420]   No, you're right in between.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:56.420]   You're right in the middle.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.420]   The price is right.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.420]   I guess he weighs 162 pounds.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.420]   I'll wait more than that.
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.420]   Okay.

[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.420]   Those great folks who do go to my PC, go to assist.

[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.460]   We have multiple accounts now because sometimes we'll have two or three go to meetings going
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:36.980]   on at the same time.

[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.780]   It sounds like I'm stuttering.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.500]   I think people are just going to go to meeting.com.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.500]   Don't know.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.500]   It's visit go to meeting.com.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.500]   However, that's better.

[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:25.500]   10.
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.500]   Stop by.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.500]   Type in your address bar.
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:30.300]   www. So if you put the www...
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.300]   I should do that.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.580]   It says that on the lower third.
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.780]   Then you'd break up the go to and look go to.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.540]   Go to www.go2meeting.com/twit.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.540]   I'm out of breath.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.180]   It's like 1999 all over again.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:47.580]   Go to http colon slash /www.go2meeting.com/twit.
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.580]   Dot COM.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.580]   Dot COM.
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:52.180]   Did we say dot COM?
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.340]   No, probably not.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.340]   I hope not.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.340]   Way in the 90s.
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:56.340]   I heard people say it.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.340]   Dot COM.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.340]   The people who are uncooled in.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:59.340]   Dot ORG.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:05.140]   I remember on the site trying to convince them not to put http colon slash slash in the
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.140]   lower third.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.140]   Yeah, right.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.140]   And in the teleprompter, right?
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:12.900]   And then eventually we got to the point where I was trying to teleproducer not to put www
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:16.020]   into the URLs on the screen savers.
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.020]   Go to meaning.com/treats.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.020]   Go to meaning.com/twit.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.540]   It's so much easier to say that.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:21.540]   Try it today.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.540]   You'll love it.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.540]   What are you laughing at?
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.540]   Kevin.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.540]   Kevin's doing strange things.
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.540]   Kevin doing something bizarre.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:27.540]   I thought of you.
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.540]   I was rapping.
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.940]   Was he flipping me off?
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.940]   Was he pinching?
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.940]   I don't know.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.820]   He looked like he was trying to swat a very large bug.
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:37.820]   Have another.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:38.820]   Is that blue?
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:39.820]   Blue.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.020]   It's not blue in color.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.420]   It's just blue in spirit.
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:44.420]   Yes.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.420]   Am I blue?
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.420]   Label.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:47.420]   Label.
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.740]   Mike Arrington and Carol Bartz.
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:50.740]   That was fun.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.740]   Oh, that was awesome.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:52.740]   Did you?
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.820]   Were you there for that, Sarah Lane, at Disrupta?
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.820]   I was.
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:56.820]   I was.
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:02.420]   And you know, it's funny because my initial reaction is different than the way I feel about
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:06.260]   it now because at the time, you know, you had a conference and the conferences as interesting
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.260]   as they are.
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:11.580]   Yeah, they go for a few hours and you're talking to a lot of VCs and, you know, sometimes
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:17.780]   I find it like I have to, you know, after a few, you know, I'm hungry for lunch and,
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.340]   you know, maybe I'm sort of struggling to keep paying attention to everything that's
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.340]   being said.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.540]   So you were drowsy and cranky.
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:24.860]   So that, well, yeah.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.820]   So that interview was like, you know, Mike started out with hell, the F.R.
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.860]   Yeah, to her and everyone went, ah, you know, we all woke up.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.660]   And so everybody was kind of listening to the.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:34.660]   I kind of like that.
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.260]   I thought that's kind of cool.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:38.260]   Well, I mean, it was J. Rosen.
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:39.260]   They were buddies.
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:45.540]   Sort of a friendly thing like, you know, we had tech friendship and heart on you and
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.180]   but, you know, here you are and you came willingly and everything.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:54.620]   But then as it went on, um, it was almost as if, I don't know, I guess it was almost
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:56.260]   as if she had something to prove.
[00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:01.820]   And when she told him to, you know what she said, um, you know, there was lots of laughter
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.500]   and lots of applause in the audience and everyone thought it was so funny and the interview
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.900]   kind of wrapped up soon after that.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:11.580]   But then you think about it and it's like, it really comes down to it sort of the shock
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.580]   value aside.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:19.260]   This is the CEO of a very large company and the true spokesperson of that company.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:25.740]   And here you have a technology, um, you know, journalist asking you questions and that's
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.740]   your answer.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.060]   I mean, that is a, that's a really sort of a weird image to project.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.060]   Don't you think?
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:35.260]   Well, she in fact, you know, he starts to question her about the direction of Yahoo and
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.380]   she says, how big is your company?
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:43.580]   Like, you know, it's, it's sort of, again, it's like it was, it was funny in the moment.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:50.100]   But when you think about it, you go, I mean, how can that's not, not only is that not
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:54.180]   an answer, but I mean, that's a, that's a very strange answer.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.540]   You know, I mean, you can't, I can't be your answer if someone asks you a question at a
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.540]   technology conference that you came to willingly.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:06.980]   But she's famous for her kind of body mouth, right?
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.980]   Maybe so.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:13.700]   But okay, then, then answer it that way and then provide some numbers and facts.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.700]   Here we go.
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.380]   Here's the, here's the audio from TechCrunch.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.380]   You are involved in a very tiny company.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:26.380]   Very tiny company.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:34.860]   And it probably takes a long time to even convince yourself what the hell am I going to do.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:37.060]   I think this isn't good fun.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.060]   Does she answer the question?
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.060]   Yes, she does.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.060]   She answers this.
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:44.700]   By the way, that cackling Robert Scobel.
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.660]   Oh my God.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:50.260]   Somebody give him a mute button and keep it muted.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.060]   Well, it's, this is being, this is a video from the audience.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.340]   I don't know if there's an official video.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:58.220]   This is from the audience and the guy unfortunately sitting right next to Scobel.
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:05.460]   The fun people we're supposed to do in this short time.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.860]   So, you know, I took that in good fun.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.860]   I don't know.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.940]   How did Mike take it when he, when, when she laid that on him?
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:18.660]   You know, I, like I said, the interview ended soon after that.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:19.660]   They had gone over.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:24.020]   So it wasn't like he was like, oh, I want to end the interview because I'm mad or anything.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.980]   I think it was probably jarring.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:29.820]   I mean, it was kind of just a sort of a, just a jarring thing in general.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.660]   She's famous for that kind of like it.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.540]   If he thought it was funny or not.
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.540]   I kind of like it.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.540]   She's got a point.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.340]   I mean, he's, you know, I mean, he's doing his job.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.620]   It's kind of like going on Stephen Colbert, right?
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.820]   I mean, when you go on there, you shouldn't expect to have a very straight ahead forward
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.380]   Bill Moyer's type conversation.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.380]   You're going to have fun.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.660]   When you go talk to Michael Arrington, you should, you should expect to have a tech crunch-like
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.660]   conversation.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.340]   And that, that seems to be in the style I guarantee.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.340]   I'm trying to screw off.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.340]   Have you?
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.340]   Yes.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:59.340]   Where's that keyword chat?
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.340]   When you need them.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.780]   I understand her point of view, but that was all over dig.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.780]   That was.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.780]   Yeah, I know.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:09.940]   Well, but isn't this just distracting from Yahoo's performance as it were?
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.740]   Well, see, that is the fundamental question.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.220]   What is she doing to turn around?
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.220]   Did she answer that question?
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:18.900]   No, but it's a, she, yes, she said it's a big boat and it's going to take us a while
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.580]   to turn it around.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.860]   One of the things they did this week was they purchased associated content.
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.980]   Which I don't think was a very smart thing to do.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.580]   I mean, Yahoo is all about more premium level content.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.780]   I mean, look, they've got, they've got great content that people go there and now they're
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.940]   doing this bottom of the barrel scraping.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.460]   You know, I'm not sure that's the right thing.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.820]   It might be good for the search engine.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:41.820]   But they are searching.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.100]   They would, but, but, but, but, but, but, they are a search engine.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.100]   That's what I mean.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.100]   That's what I mean.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:51.500]   I mean, the way that buying, buying Flickr has actually been really good for Yahoo's image
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.500]   search.
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.220]   Yahoo's image search is actually really good because they own Flickr.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.220]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.220]   Doesn't Microsoft do it now?
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.420]   Well, and, and, yeah, but it's a partnership, right?
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:04.260]   So Yahoo can provide some access maybe to associated content and maybe lift some of that stuff.
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.260]   It's a long shot.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.260]   I'll grant you.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.260]   But I could see that being some of the reason.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.260]   Yahoo is in the content business.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.260]   So that's what Yahoo does.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.260]   But they are a premium.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.260]   Are they though?
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.260]   Yes.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.260]   They're the biggest content.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.260]   They keep going back and forth though.
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.260]   They are.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.260]   They have all the people writing sports.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.260]   They have their, their producing shows.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.380]   You know, OMG, we talked about this a few months ago.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.060]   Do you know what OMG is?
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:27.180]   OMG is the number one, forget TMZ.
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.300]   Sarah, do you ever go to this site?
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.300]   OMG.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.300]   OMG.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.300]   POP.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.300]   OMG.Yahoo.com.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:37.380]   This is the number one celebrity site far and away.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.380]   More than pop sugar?
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.380]   Yes.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.380]   Because pop sugar is really popular.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.380]   Oh my goodness.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.380]   This is it.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.380]   I've never even heard of this one.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.380]   But apparently.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.140]   Real people have heard of it.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.420]   Not, not geeks.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.420]   This is for real people.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:54.060]   Hot topics, couples, pets, fashion, faux pas and baby bumps.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.780]   I mean, real people who want to read about Hulk Hogan and Britney Spears apparently.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.140]   So Hulk Hogan's breakfast brawl.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.620]   I mean, is that, is that interest you?
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.620]   No.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.620]   My dinner.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.620]   Chris O'Donnell, Dreamy Dad.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:06.620]   I don't think so.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.740]   I mean, this, it's just, it's waste of time.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.740]   By the way, Dennis Hopper.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.740]   Ah.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.740]   And he rest in peace.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:14.740]   Great man.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.740]   Gary Coleman.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.980]   And Art Link Letter.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.660]   It goes in three, he's doesn't it?
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:23.500]   Do you think when Art passed on, he really thought I'm going with Dennis and Gary to
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   the Pearly Gates?
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.500]   Can't say the darn same.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:33.260]   I, I have to say, interviewed Art Link Letter many, about 15 years ago on radio.
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:35.580]   He was still surfing in his 80s in Hawaii.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.860]   One of the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.460]   Just a really class guy.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.540]   Dennis Hopper, I don't know.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.540]   Little weird.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]   But cool.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.540]   Very cool.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.540]   Cool.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.540]   As long as you were more than 50 feet from him.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.260]   I'm not sure I would have wanted to spend a lot of time with him.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:58.260]   We were going to have Karis Swisher on today, but she's awfully busy with this thing called
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.260]   D.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.260]   D.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.260]   D.
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.260]   D.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.300]   And man, do they have a lineup for D?
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.620]   It's pretty exciting.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:07.780]   Including Balmer.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.740]   Steve Jobs is going back, I think.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.740]   Isn't he?
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.740]   He'll be there.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.740]   Jobs will be there.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.740]   Speaking or just taking on stage.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:15.740]   Really?
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.140]   Are they going to do the Jobs Gates thing that they did?
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.140]   That was so cool.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.140]   Not sure Gates is going to be there.
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.580]   Wasn't that a great interview?
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:25.300]   Speaking of which, you're doing a great job with those dig interviews you do.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.300]   You get some big names.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.300]   Oh, the big ones.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.300]   Those are fun.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.300]   Yeah, love those.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.460]   We've had that Clinton on recently.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.620]   How come you aren't doing all of those though?
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.620]   Aren't you the guy?
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.620]   Oh, gosh.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.620]   I don't want to travel anymore.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.620]   I'm tired of flying around.
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.660]   There's too much going on in the office right now.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.140]   We're working to clone Kevin.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.580]   We need four of them.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.780]   There's more Kevin's.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:55.100]   So we were talking about Sex and the City as the only person who saw it, Sarah Lane.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.660]   Why are we talking about it?
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:01.020]   Because remember that Carrie Bradshaw was always a Mac user?
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.500]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.660]   So what's funny about the movie is that they've got this big HP integration.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:17.300]   In fact, HP, and that's actually why I was able to go to Premiere because it was an HP
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.660]   event, which was very nice to them.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.980]   I was Natalie Del Conte, who got me a ticket to the museum in New York.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:24.980]   So we had a little girl date.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.540]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:31.940]   But what we noticed right away in the movie was that's a Mac book.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:32.940]   That's a movie Mac book.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:36.340]   I mean, they covered up the Apple logo, but it's a Mac book.
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.340]   It's a new Mac book.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:41.620]   And they're using iPhones, the other girls, the desert and everything.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:46.220]   And it's like, I don't know if there was an HP in that movie, but if it was, it was very
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.220]   cleverly hidden.
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.220]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.540]   Well, here she is doing an HP ad.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:57.580]   So you're saying that there was never an HP-- there were still all the Mac laptops there.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.580]   That's correct.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.580]   Well, hers.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.860]   The other women don't really use laptops in the show.
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.660]   She's writing their blog as she--
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.660]   Right.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.660]   --the sort of dialogue.
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:11.460]   Dear Tyree, Mr. Big and I are having another fight.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:16.060]   Later that day, Charlotte got to thank you.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:21.700]   But yeah, but that HP ad was shown before the movie in the theater.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.500]   And that's the only HP I ever saw.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.900]   So a little confusing.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.380]   And I wasn't the only one who kind of remembered about that.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:31.500]   But no, Carrie is not an HP user.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   She still uses a Mac.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.620]   Unless it's the sort of thing where they go, OK, well, in the old days, if we cover the
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.460]   Apple logo, then no one will know that that's a MacBook.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.820]   I don't know who they're fooling.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:45.020]   I got to tell you, this whole ad is stupid because it's supposed to be Carrie, but they
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.020]   never show her head.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.860]   It's obviously not Carrie.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:49.660]   And that's a pair as much.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:53.100]   Which is-- yeah, I guess that's true because it's not like Sarah Jessica Parker couldn't
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.100]   rock that outfit.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.420]   I mean, it looks like her, but it's--
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.420]   It totally looks like her.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.940]   But why would you cut her head off the whole commercial?
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:02.340]   It's a Stereoner and Belly button.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.180]   And by the way, is this the HP Slate?
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.860]   What is that?
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:08.020]   Jim, is that the Slate?
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.100]   They never denied that they were going to-- you know, the rumor was they weren't going
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.100]   to make the Slate.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.900]   Well, they kicked windows out, right?
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.380]   No, but that was pure rumors.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.380]   But it's pure rumor.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.420]   The HP people said, no, he never said that.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.260]   So we don't even know what they're going to do.
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:26.260]   I think HP, if I remember, right, has said, yes, we are going to do a WebOS tablet, but
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:29.900]   they haven't confirmed that they are not going to do a Windows Slate.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:33.140]   It's all been like off the record comments.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.980]   So--
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.980]   Yes.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:36.980]   Sounds like no.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.980]   They're going to do a Windows tablet later.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.580]   We're going to do the WebOS first.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.460]   There's a marketing issue at HP now that David Roman is gone.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.980]   So they went through some really interesting marketing issues.
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:51.220]   So David Roman is the guy from Apple who went over to HP in the Personal Systems Group,
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.420]   did the whole campaign, the computers personal again, and really helped drive HP from being
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:58.660]   this engineering driven company, a marketing driven company.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.220]   They brought in a new-- and this is interesting.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.500]   They brought in a new CMO for HP from Walt Disney.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.700]   And I was just talking to somebody who had been working with that person at Disney and
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.300]   said that he was not a very smart person or a very smart person.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.300]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.540]   And so they bring in this stuff shirt from Disney to run all marketing for HP.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.420]   This is what I've been told.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.340]   And they didn't put Roman in there.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.020]   David Roman's a guy who did all this great thing for PSG.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.460]   So what does he do?
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.460]   He goes to Lenovo.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.620]   And he's now running marketing for Lenovo.
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.620]   Interesting.
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:29.900]   So HP, who knows what's going on there with this new guy from Disney?
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.900]   I guess it's going to be the Seven Dwarfs and HP trying to sell computers.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.860]   David Roman's over at Lenovo.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.860]   And now we see changes happening at Lenovo.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:41.100]   Well, remember they did show the U1, which I really liked at CES.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.100]   We did a nice piece on it.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.100]   It's a cool product.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:45.100]   It was a--
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.100]   It was a cool product too.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:50.940]   A laptop that had a detachable screen that was running a weird Linux version of the
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.940]   OS.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.220]   Now they're saying that's going to be Android.
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.220]   That's the newest.
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220]   And they delayed the U1.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.220]   Right.
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.220]   They were saying over $1,000.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.980]   You can get an iPad for $500.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:00.980]   500.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:01.980]   Well, on Craigslist.
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:02.980]   Really?
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:03.980]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.980]   I should go out and get one.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:05.820]   You can get an iPad for $500.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.700]   You can get a computer for-- go buy a Toshiva notebook for $400.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:14.900]   Apple, of course, started selling the iPad in a new way.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.900]   And I'm going to buy a Toshiva notebook for $400.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.900]   I'm going to buy a Toshiva notebook for $400.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.700]   Apple, of course, started selling the iPad in a new way.
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:24.340]   And I'm going to buy a Toshiva notebook for $400.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:28.220]   Apple, of course, started selling the iPad internationally and big lines.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.220]   Lots of interest.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:34.820]   Australia, the UK, Japan, apparently eaten it up, which kind of surprises me because
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.100]   Japan is famous for very small, very compact notebooks.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.060]   They don't have a lot of computers.
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.980]   They like their smartphones.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:45.340]   Maybe the iPad is the Japanese computer.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:50.500]   Well, there's just not a lot that's exciting in Japanese technology right now.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:55.300]   And I think the iPhone is kind of taking away some of the luster from Sony and some of
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.460]   the other companies there of the cool little stuff they used to build.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:03.340]   They think that now that it's gone worldwide, that it will outsell Mac laptops.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:04.340]   Mac-- it's amazing.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.260]   Mac platforms actually does top-san laptop.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.460]   I won't win my bet.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:10.540]   Do you think it's cannibalizing Mac laptops?
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.540]   I don't.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:15.980]   And the analysts that I've read say that it doesn't-- this time I agree with them.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:20.260]   I don't think that you buy a tablet instead of a Mac.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.780]   You might buy it instead of a netbook or something like that.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:23.780]   In the long run?
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:24.780]   I don't think you buy it instead of Mac.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.620]   It helps all about Apple, I think, in the long run.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:30.460]   The question is Apple's making so much money on phones and pads.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:35.540]   Does it really-- does it have the interest in the desktop that it might have had five
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.540]   years ago?
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.540]   I bet not.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.620]   Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:43.820]   As desktop interest is going way down laptop interest, we'll see.
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:49.940]   Maybe as we get these 36 or 32 Android tablets at Computex and HP comes out with their
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:53.340]   WebOS tablets, we'll start to see people less interested in laptops.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:57.420]   The problem is with all these tablets so far, you have to have a computer to operate them.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:01.500]   I want to buy my mom who's got no internet connectivity and nothing.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.500]   It's so stupid.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.300]   But she has Wi-Fi where she lives.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:05.300]   It's available.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.300]   She perfectly lives.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.580]   I would love to buy her an iPad and just say, "Hey, here's something where you don't have
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.500]   to know anything to use it."
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.380]   And I'd set it up to configure it for a Wi-Fi, but she has to have computer--
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.380]   No, you know you do.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.380]   I had a call on the radio show ask the same thing.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.380]   She said, "I'm 80 years old.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:19.380]   I want an iPad.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:22.340]   If you don't have a computer, you have Apple activated."
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.820]   And then you never need to do it again.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:25.820]   Can you--
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.460]   So you're at the Apple store.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.180]   You have-- because when you first turn on the iPad effect, they were saying this in
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:33.340]   Japan, all these people, as we're getting out of the store and opening up their box to
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:34.500]   say, "My iPad!"
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.900]   And then it says, "Look up to iTunes."
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.700]   But to get an iTunes account--
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:40.420]   Do you say you do that at the store?
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:45.140]   Yeah, you'd have them set up an iTunes account on the laptop at the store and then walk out
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.140]   the door.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.140]   You'd never connect it again.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.540]   My music, you could buy apps.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.820]   You don't need to connect it again unless you want to print.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.740]   Once you get it set up, you're right.
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:54.740]   Okay.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.740]   Maybe that's the key.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:56.740]   Maybe that's the solution then.
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:57.740]   Kindle!
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.060]   Kindle is not dead yet.
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.300]   I love my Kindle.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.260]   You know, my wife loves her Kindle.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.260]   Anybody else here?
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:04.260]   I've used the iPad.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.900]   I love my Kindle application that I use on my iPad.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:06.900]   That's what I use on the iPad.
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:07.900]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.900]   Sarah?
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.220]   Yeah, it's better on the iPad that it is on the actual Kindle.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:14.820]   Until you take it outside and try to read it around the pool like I did all weekends.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:15.820]   I don't know, man.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.820]   I don't know.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:20.020]   I just pulled that Kindle and it does not feel good.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.020]   I hate the buttons.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.020]   Ugh, sorry.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.020]   The actual Kindle is lighter.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.020]   It's much lighter.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.020]   It's fine.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.020]   I have a really small Kindle and it works.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.420]   We have, because the iPad is what?
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.420]   20 pounds?
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.420]   I mean, it's not that heavy.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.620]   Well, that cracks me up because people say, "Oh, the iPad, you know, what is the
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:34.620]   pound and a half?
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.620]   Oh, it's so much heavier than the Kindle."
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.620]   It wears on you, though.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.980]   And I said, "Well, how heavy is a book for crying out loud?"
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:40.980]   It wears on you.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:43.620]   The iPad is like, "Do we have to carry around?"
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.620]   He's very weak.
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:45.620]   Not to carry around.
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:47.620]   It's a whole for a long time.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.620]   It starts to...
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:49.620]   No, you just...
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.620]   None of you have read it for that long.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.620]   No, I have.
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.620]   You know what I do?
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:54.620]   You have to put it on your legs.
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:55.620]   I rest it on my pillow.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.620]   You have to get to do something like that.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.620]   I read sideways.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:59.620]   It's not so bad.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.620]   Kevin, iPad or Kindle?
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.020]   You know, it's funny.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:07.140]   My dad has Kindle and we went fishing a couple weeks ago and I had my iPad and I showed
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.140]   it to him and he played with it and he's like, "That does news as well."
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.140]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.980]   I launched the USA Today App for him and he's like, "I want one.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.220]   I'm getting rid of my Kindle."
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.740]   I think everyone's going to get rid of their Kindle's and go iPad for some iPad but I'm
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:19.740]   also a family.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:24.740]   Interesting because, you know, August, we're supposed to see a new Kindle thinner lighter.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:25.740]   Maybe color.
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.740]   Not color.
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:27.740]   No way.
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.740]   It's not touch but faster.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:29.740]   So I was at CID this week.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.180]   I spoke to the TV 3.0.
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:34.820]   It's the display, the guys do all the display stuff.
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:37.660]   And they were rolling out all the different display technology.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.180]   They had the Super Thin HD TV.
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:40.180]   Is E-ink there too?
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:44.060]   E-ink was there and they were showing a color version of the E-ink.
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.060]   And a bunch of other companies were showing similar E-paper and color.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.620]   Now, still looks washed out.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.620]   Doesn't look great.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.620]   They do.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.620]   Slow page turn.
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.620]   Yeah, but color's there.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:54.460]   I mean, and I asked the guys at E-ink.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:58.220]   I said, "So why does Amazon say they're not going to do a color Kindle for a while?"
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.260]   He's like, "You have to ask Amazon."
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.420]   But it looked all right.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:06.500]   Yeah, the thing is with the iPad is that if you really want to use it to read books,
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:11.220]   you have to install the Amazon application because the iBooks has absolutely nothing.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.220]   It's crappy.
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.380]   I kind of like it that I can buy.
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:16.860]   I buy stuff on the Kindle.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:17.860]   Read it sometimes in the Kindle.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.860]   Read it sometimes in the iPad.
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:19.860]   They sync up.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:21.860]   Sometimes on my iPhone.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.860]   I kind of like that.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:28.940]   So you want to live inside baseball though on the iPhone and the iTunes Store for books.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:34.460]   The guys who ran the podcasting group at Apple for a long time, Scott and Pete, are now
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.820]   on the iBooks side.
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.820]   Yep.
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.460]   So it will probably get better because those guys are great.
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:40.540]   But they got to make the deals.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.420]   It's not how great those guys are.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.420]   It's how great the publishers are.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.820]   And you would think publishers would be so anxious to break Amazon's chokehold on their
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.820]   business.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:53.020]   There have been a couple of books that have been exclusive to the iPad.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.500]   You couldn't get them on the Kindle.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.500]   They were able to snip.
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:58.540]   I found a book that I wanted that I had to buy on the iPad.
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.380]   It couldn't buy it in the Kindle Store.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:02.740]   But those are, I think, a few and far between.
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:04.020]   Is there a Kindle for Android yet?
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.020]   I know that that's in beta.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.140]   Let me just check and see.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.140]   Because I just love the...
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.540]   I think Amazon's sharp.
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:13.340]   All they have to do is make this Kindle play everywhere.
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.340]   Are they in it for the...
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.780]   Do they need to sell Kindle hardware?
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:16.780]   No.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:21.260]   I think Bezos did the right thing, which is to separate the Kindle Store people from
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:22.700]   the Kindle hardware people.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.700]   Oh, it's one.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.700]   And say both of you go after it.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.900]   Oh, it's two divisions.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.900]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.380]   And so that's why you see the apps everywhere because the Kindle Store people are like,
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:31.380]   "We want it.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.380]   We want it."
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.380]   Every where.
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:34.380]   Every where.
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.380]   Hardware people have just got to catch up on their own.
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.380]   And so they're not totally out of it yet.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.580]   But they're competing on their own.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:42.860]   We're going to take a break, come back, speak in the books and Amazon and talk a little
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.700]   bit about audible.com.
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:48.980]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E, Audible books are the best audio books.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.460]   Really, they're the last audio book place out there.
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:55.580]   I suppose somebody else is doing it, but Audible's just so head and shoulders about the rest.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:56.580]   Because that's...
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:58.420]   Yeah, you can still get cassettes probably somewhere.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.900]   75,000 books.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:01.900]   It's really hard.
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:04.780]   You know, when you get to the Audible bookstore, you want them all.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.500]   That's why I have a platinum account.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.300]   It's two books a month.
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.620]   And believe me, I listened to them.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.020]   I'm just finishing up the Time Traveler's wife.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.300]   And I've got the Stieg Larson trilogy on...
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.540]   Is that good?
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.540]   I haven't started it.
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:18.640]   It's my next book.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.540]   He wrote, of course, the Girl with the Dragon tattoo.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.580]   And then he followed that up.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:27.500]   What was the next one that he came up with right after that?
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.300]   And then now the new one is out.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:31.060]   The girl who kicked the hornets nest.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.420]   Supposed to be wonderful.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.900]   Can't wait to read those.
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:40.780]   So now I can't get you three books free, but I can get you your first two free.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:45.260]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.100]   And you can get the girl who...
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.300]   The girl with the Dragon tattoo.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.500]   That's the first one.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.780]   The girl who played with fire.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:52.780]   That's the second one.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:55.820]   And if you're not hooked, you know, you can quit at any time.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:56.820]   You get to keep those books.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:59.380]   They're yours free forever.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.580]   But I got to warn you, I have a feeling if you listen to the first two, you're going
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.820]   to be listening to the girl who kicked the hornets nest.
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:07.460]   Can I make a recommendation, Leo?
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:08.460]   I'd love it.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.460]   I'd love it.
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:10.460]   Audible.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:12.820]   I just listened to rework by Jason Treeb.
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:13.820]   Yes.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:14.820]   Unbelievably good book.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:15.820]   Wow.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.660]   Do you want for newers looking to get started?
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:18.660]   Amazing.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:22.740]   Jason and David Hainemeyer Hanson are the founders of 37 Signals.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.300]   David, of course, wrote Ruby on Rails for 37 Signals.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.100]   And this is not their first book.
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:34.100]   We had them on at night, actually, just a little while ago, talking about this book.
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:35.100]   Rework.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.100]   Yep.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.100]   Very nice audio book.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:38.100]   You see the problem?
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:42.300]   Now I've got four books for you to listen to.
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.620]   It's nice when something's so great.
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:44.620]   You just can't stop.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.460]   If you have felt like reading has left you behind because your life is so busy, don't
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:51.260]   forget you've got lots of time to read in the car.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:55.220]   When you're commuting, driving the kids around, doing housework at the gym, I listen every day
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:56.300]   for an hour a day.
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.700]   That's a lot of reading after a while.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.060]   It builds up.
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:03.500]   You still can read all those times when you can't hold a book, listen to audible.com.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:10.700]   It plays on over 500 devices, including all the iPhone, iPad, iPod devices, the Zoom, the
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.860]   Kindle, even.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:15.140]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.140]   Go there right now.
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:17.140]   Sign up for that platinum account.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:19.820]   Get two books absolutely free.
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.820]   I'm so excited.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:21.820]   I love it.
[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:22.820]   You know, it's funny.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:25.540]   I get torn because when a book ends, it's said and time traveler's wife is wonderful.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:27.380]   That would actually might be a good one for sword and lice.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:28.380]   We have that on our shirt.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:29.380]   It's sci-fi.
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.380]   And it's beautiful.
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:34.420]   I called it one of the best sci-fi books of the decade so far.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.420]   Really?
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.420]   Of the decade last day.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:37.420]   You know what?
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:41.660]   It reminds me a little of Memento and these other books that play with memory and time.
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:45.700]   Well Memento wasn't a book, it was a movie, but the idea of being a time traveler and how
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.700]   it affects your relationship is fascinating.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:48.700]   I just love it.
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.140]   It's not science in it.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:51.140]   It's just some...
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.140]   It's a science fiction.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.140]   He is Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.140]   Yes.
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.140]   Sure.
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.140]   That's the whole point of slaughterhouse five, isn't it?
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:57.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:58.140]   It's a time.
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:59.140]   Yep.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.140]   That's a good book.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:02.180]   See, I just finished the foundation.
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.580]   They just put that out on Audible.
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:06.940]   I'm so excited.
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.580]   Did you read all the editions as well?
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.060]   The first three.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.580]   It goes on forever.
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:17.580]   Yeah, well, the fourth foundation book.
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.580]   Do they go downhill?
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.580]   Do they go downhill?
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:20.740]   Jim, or are they as good?
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.020]   I think the foundation trilogy is just brilliant.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.780]   The fourth foundation book is good.
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:29.460]   I think they start to go downhill, and then they other people start to play in the foundation
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:30.460]   universe and those...
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:31.460]   It's like Doom.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.460]   It got to be like Doom.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.460]   Right.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.460]   Exactly.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.860]   How many Doom books can you read?
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:38.380]   Even Doom went downhill, even when Robert was writing them.
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:40.220]   I just want to thank Audible.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:42.140]   This just came out in April.
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.980]   Foundation is the first time it's been on audio.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:49.540]   Another one where Audible has just reached out and made these books happen.
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:51.060]   Did you listen to it or did you read it, Kevin?
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.300]   No, I read it, but I'm going to listen to the next one.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.300]   Scott Brick reads them.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.300]   He's one of their better readers.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:01.260]   Yeah, they've got Foundation Empire Second Foundation.
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.260]   That's the big three.
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.740]   Foundation Foundation Empire Second Foundation.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.620]   The Galactic Empire.
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:08.620]   Harry Sheldon.
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:09.620]   Harry Sheldon.
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.620]   Psycho History.
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:11.620]   Psycho Historian.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.620]   Very cool stuff.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:14.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:15.620]   Great stuff.
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.620]   Great social.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:21.580]   Think about how social sociology applies across an entire galaxy of planets.
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:25.660]   So, this is a good panel to ask us about this net neutrality thing.
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:32.100]   The FCC wants to assert it and they have said we have the right, even though this district
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.700]   court in Washington, DC said you didn't quite do it right.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:39.020]   The FCC says, okay, but we do have the right because we're going to regulate it.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.740]   And now 73 Democrats wrote a letter.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:45.540]   This is kind of weird saying, drop the net neutrality rules.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:50.140]   That's a lot of House Democrats saying, no, we don't.
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.140]   What is it?
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.140]   Is it libertarian?
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:53.940]   They don't want the government involved.
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.460]   Well, yeah, Democrats aren't usually libertarian.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.660]   You'd think they'd want the regulation.
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:22:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:02.460]   I might take on it as it's lobbyists.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.500]   They don't even know what they're talking about.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.980]   It's lobbyists for telcos.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:09.460]   For ISPs of all large kinds.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.380]   And large media companies that are being purchased by telcos.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.980]   Because my position has always been we don't need net neutrality rules if we have enough
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:16.980]   competition.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:21.020]   Competitions that we don't have enough competition, especially on the backbone.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.020]   Here's what I'd like.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.500]   We have plenty of bandwidth.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:29.060]   We just have people who have a vested self interest in Comcast and AT&T and others in
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:35.460]   putting in a tiered internet where they can charge their competitors more to deliver video
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:38.540]   than they do because they're all in the content game.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:39.540]   But there is this thing.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:45.780]   I mean, that hasn't that been part of the muddy waters of government for a long time.
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:48.740]   I mean, just because it's the internet and net neutrality that we're talking about doesn't
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:51.540]   mean that there isn't a little bit of that going on.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:54.420]   I mean, it's kind of like obviously, right?
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:59.500]   Well, Comcast admitted to the fact that they were actually doing this to BitTorrent.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.500]   Right?
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:01.500]   Right.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:02.500]   I mean, well, yeah.
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.500]   And they said we have the right to do it.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.500]   Right.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:05.500]   Well, and look, they said we're not going to do it anymore.
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.500]   Do you believe them?
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.220]   Look, this is it's a in a capitalistic environment.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:13.980]   If you have control over things and you can make your stuff better than other people's
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:17.460]   stuff that are competing with you, you're going to do everything you can to make your
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.620]   things more viable and their things less vile.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.620]   That's what this letter says.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:26.900]   Dear Chairman Genakowski, we are writing a reinforced, a strong bipartisan consensus among
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:30.940]   policymakers, industry participants and analysts.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:35.340]   The success of the broadband marketplace stems from policies that encourage competition,
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:38.740]   private investment and legal certainty.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:42.660]   See, Comcast's point of view is, oh, well, there's competition, but we know there's not
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:43.660]   competition.
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:44.660]   Not enough.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.900]   Well, and what and here's a real problem with competition.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:46.900]   Also, I tried to do this.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:50.260]   I have AT&T DSL at home and I was just pissed off at them.
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.060]   And I was like, I'm going to go to Comcast.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:53.060]   Call on Comcast.
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:54.060]   I'm like, can I switch?
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:55.620]   And they're like, oh, yeah, it's 42 bucks a month.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:56.620]   I was paying 30 bucks.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.620]   I'm like, you know, that's all right.
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.380]   Pay the extra 12 bucks for more bandwidth.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:02.900]   Oh, but they said that price is only if you sign up for television and for phone and
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.020]   all this other are a comp, crap stick stuff.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.740]   And I'm like, look, I like my direct TV.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:09.980]   I am not changing to Comcast television.
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:10.980]   Right.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:11.980]   And it was like 60 bucks a month.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:12.980]   Right.
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.340]   So they wanted to charge me double.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:19.100]   And I think that pricing problem is a big deal as the other issues of them slowing down
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:22.740]   caps, slowing down bits.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:27.700]   The letter goes on to say the expanded FCC jurisdiction over broadband that has been proposed
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:32.940]   and the manner in which it would be implemented are unprecedented and create regulatory uncertainty.
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:37.820]   The controversy surrounding that approach will likely serve as a distraction.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:42.060]   This is Democrats talking from what should be our nation's foremost communications priority,
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:44.420]   bringing broadband to every corner of America.
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:45.660]   But is it really a tit for tat?
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:46.980]   No, I don't think so.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:51.020]   I don't think you can you can say that if you put in that neutrality regulation, that
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:56.100]   that means you can't that you're distracted somehow from providing broadband to the the
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.100]   rural areas.
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:01.860]   But but I there is a point in that letter, which is what we should be focusing on is
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:06.180]   creating a an environment where there is more competition where you have more choice.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:10.260]   That should be the priority and but it's not that I got to tell you, this is not the subtext
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:11.260]   of this letter.
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:16.100]   The subtext of the letter is and it's taken right out of the Comcast Verizon playbook is,
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:20.980]   oh, this will cause regulatory uncertainty and we won't be able to invest in infrastructure
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:25.380]   because we don't know what's going to happen or if we can monetize our investments.
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:29.660]   So if you really want us to build out broadband, you better give us a free hand to run our
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:30.660]   businesses.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:34.740]   And that's a bunch of crap because they have been taking government money for decades to
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:38.060]   not build out their their their infrastructure.
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:41.340]   So why would things change if a few of these regulations go in place?
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:45.340]   And I'm not even saying I'm in favor of these regulations, but this reasoning is crap.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:50.540]   And that's what I that's what I object to is the idea that somehow if the FCC were to
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:56.340]   put in this very lightweight regulation, that they would stop the slow infrastructure build
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:59.580]   out that they already have, they haven't been building out their infrastructure anyway.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.580]   And they have tons of subsidies.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.580]   Well, why hasn't that changed?
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.340]   Well, I was already said they're going to stop.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:04.340]   They're like, we're done.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.740]   We're not doing any more of our fiber.
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:06.740]   That's too bad.
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:07.740]   Really?
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:08.740]   It's amazing.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:09.740]   They got as far as they did.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.940]   Everybody I talked to said, Oh, this is completely a PR stunt by Verizon.
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.940]   There's no way they can monetize this.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:18.980]   It's going to cost them $5,000 per subscriber to build out fire.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.700]   There's no way they're going to make that money back.
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:21.740]   It's a PR stunt.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:26.580]   So the people will think Verizon is faster and will buy Verizon DSL.
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:28.580]   Does that what you just said maybe makes that true?
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.300]   Well, they did a pretty big build out, but they don't know.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.300]   Yeah, they did a lot with them.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.300]   I can't get it.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.300]   I'm interested in this.
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:35.300]   I don't know.
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:36.620]   Have you guys heard of Allied fiber?
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.620]   I saw it on Gigo.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.620]   You're going to interview.
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:42.740]   I'm going to try to get Hunter Newby, their CEO, to talk on Tuesday.
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:49.260]   They have a plan to put in a brand new fiber network coast to coast, dark fiber, and run
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:51.420]   it neutrally to say, you know what?
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:54.140]   We are all we're going to do is run this network.
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:55.140]   That's a--
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.140]   We're not going to get into content.
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.140]   We're not going to get anything else.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:01.180]   And we're going to wholesale it out so that any ISP that wants to run on it can run on.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.580]   I've been saying this for a long time.
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:05.140]   There's enough money in this.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:08.780]   If you sell at wholesale like that, it doesn't cost that much.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.180]   There's enough dark fiber.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.580]   Switches aren't that expensive.
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:15.660]   Once you do the build out, there's not a whole lot of additional expense to maintain
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.660]   it.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.660]   You know what?
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.660]   I think it's a good test.
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.260]   I think it would be a good-- even if this net neutrality stuff goes in, price-based or
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:25.220]   access-based, they should make it so it's only for people who serve more than 100 or
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:31.700]   150,000 customers so that we can get those small ISPs back that serve communities and
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:33.060]   make it easy for them to happen.
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:34.060]   You remember, Brett Glass?
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.740]   He runs an ISP in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.900]   He's a writer for ZD Network.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.460]   He wrote for a bunch of different places.
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:44.460]   The guy's running a little town ISP in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:47.380]   Net neutrality stuff, if it put in place, would probably kill his business.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:48.380]   Why is that?
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.340]   Because of the additional restrictions that would be put on the queue.
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:51.340]   It's like Sarbanes Oxley.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:54.060]   It's a strangle hole.
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:57.020]   And he writes actually very-- That's what they're saying.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.100]   Too much regulation kills our business.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:02.300]   So let's have little-- you know, anything-- you serve more than a couple hundred thousand
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:04.020]   people, you've got to follow the rules.
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:05.020]   Tom Cascan afforded it.
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:06.020]   But Brett--
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.020]   But Brett--
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.460]   But Brett may not be able to.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.820]   And I do have to think you have to do something to support these independent ISPs.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.460]   I talked to our guy here at SonicNet.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:16.740]   That's where we get our big bandwidth for the streams.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.180]   And Dane Jasper's great guy.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:21.780]   And he says really-- you know, they're putting his fiber in Sebastian pool up here.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:23.500]   He says they're really crunching us.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.500]   They're really--
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.500]   Sit down.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.500]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.500]   Represent.
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.580]   Sebastian pool.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:33.980]   Can I be really, really rude for a second and tell you guys I have dinner with a lot
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.220]   of reservations and I have to go.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.220]   Where are you going?
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.460]   Where are we going?
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.780]   Some Italian place.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.780]   Oh, have fun.
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:42.780]   We're done.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:43.780]   We're done.
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:44.780]   We're just running on.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.780]   Sorry.
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.780]   I did want to interrupt you guys, but I just didn't want to sign up on the--
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.180]   Is it in the West Village where you-- where's the--
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:54.860]   No, I think upper-- either upper east or upper west, something-- 80th and something?
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:58.340]   She doesn't want to tell people because then all the fans will come over and have dinner
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:29:59.340]   with them.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.340]   90th.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.340]   70th.
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.540]   I was in a restaurant in the West Village a couple of years ago.
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:05.540]   It was the best place.
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.500]   It felt like a scene at a good fellas.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.460]   There was nowhere to sit, so they brought out a table.
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:11.260]   They whipped out the-- they slid people over.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.260]   Dr. Phil was there.
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.260]   I don't know why.
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.260]   Maybe they liked me.
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:15.260]   I don't know, but they--
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.260]   Dr. Phil, the icing on the cake.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.260]   The icing on the cake.
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.260]   That's from the different--
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.260]   Like any good Italian restaurant.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.260]   Dr. Phil was there.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:22.260]   They could've been good.
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.780]   Did you imagine Leo and Dr. Phil together, I think the time would stop.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:26.980]   It would be so wild.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:27.980]   I waved at him.
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.780]   You two would-- I think you two should do a show together.
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.980]   I said, yo, Phil, what's happening?
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:32.980]   All right.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.980]   Go ahead.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   Have a wonderful time.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.380]   Sarah Lane, it's so great.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:38.380]   You're coming back.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.180]   We'll see you in studio on Tuesday.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:41.900]   I'll be up there on Tuesday.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:43.380]   I will be there.
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:46.500]   I want to be part of the action for the inaugural TNT.
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:47.500]   Woo!
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:48.500]   Good time.
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:53.900]   And just to see everybody and settle in to my new desk and all that good stuff.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.900]   Yeah, you got a desk.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.900]   We gave you a desk.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.900]   And apparently there's a PS3 waiting for you.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:58.900]   PS2.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:03.900]   It's a big difference.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:04.900]   It's a 36.
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:05.900]   Oh, it's a 286.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:06.900]   Yeah, it's a 3286.
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.900]   I'll pay a farm though.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:09.900]   Let me find.
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:13.300]   And I believe we're having lunch catered for you.
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:14.300]   Yes.
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:16.900]   It's going to be a lovely vegetarian lunch.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:17.900]   I'm so happy.
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:18.900]   I'm so excited.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:19.900]   We'll see you.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:24.900]   Sarah Lane, soon to be host of iPad Today and The Green Tech Today Show.
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:26.700]   Thank you, Sarah.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.700]   Have a great dinner.
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.700]   Thanks so much.
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:30.700]   Sorry to leave early.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.500]   Enjoy the rest of you guys' conversation.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:33.500]   Good to see you all.
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.500]   And thanks for watching everybody.
[01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.500]   Bye-bye.
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:36.500]   Bye, Sarah.
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.700]   We're going to wrap up.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:42.700]   I'm kind of done unless you have a story, something that's on your mind either of you
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.700]   or the three of you.
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.500]   I just think that I've been keeping track of it when I was at, I haven't been at Sid
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.700]   and talking to guys about what they're doing with the TVs.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:55.300]   Everybody at Sid was talking about 3D TVs and how they're spending all this money on putting
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:56.300]   3D.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.900]   But it's really the internet access that I think is most fascinating.
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:00.900]   I agree.
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:01.900]   And I just --
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.700]   Of course, you and I run IPTV networks, so of course we think that.
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:04.700]   I know.
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:05.900]   But so what do you think about Google TV, Leo?
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:08.100]   I think it's going to be interesting.
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.700]   I'm underwhelmed to be honest with you.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:14.900]   I mean, this is Apple's little hobby that hasn't really taken off.
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:18.300]   Google basically seems like they're adding a layer of internet on top of it.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.300]   I don't see people wanting to have the internet on their TV.
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:23.400]   I do see a lot of people with a computer in their lap, Twittering.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.900]   Do you think it should be on the TV?
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:27.300]   Is it -- can it ever be a lean back experience?
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.300]   I think so.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.300]   You know, YouTube's coming out with their YouTube lean back.
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.300]   I don't know, Kevin, what do you think?
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.100]   What do you think about Google TV?
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:34.100]   I don't know.
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:35.100]   I agree with Leo.
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:37.500]   I think you have your iPad in your lap, you have your laptop in your lap.
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.300]   Those are the devices that you're going to use to surf the net.
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.900]   I don't think you're going to want to use your TV to ever surf the net.
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:46.400]   We've had internet on our TVs for a long time now through media, the center of boxes
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.400]   and you name it.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:51.140]   And the only thing that's ever been really good for is kind of like streaming Netflix,
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:54.700]   you know, where your Xbox 360 and watching shows on like, you know, you know, you know,
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.700]   you've got an episode of Lost and you go and you download it later and you watch it.
[01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:58.700]   So we're in agreement.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:00.700]   The idea of getting content over the internet is exciting.
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.700]   I just don't think what Google's doing for this is that exciting.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:08.100]   Well, what they will be able to do is look, there is so much stuff out there now and,
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.100]   you know, more is being created every day.
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:13.600]   And, you know, in fact, we just surveyed our audience and found that, you know, last
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:17.700]   year, under a quarter of them actually watched any of our shows on a big screen.
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:18.700]   Discoverability is a problem.
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:19.700]   Right.
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:22.500]   But 45% now are watching in some form on their big screen TV.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.500]   Wow.
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:27.500]   Google brings is the ability to go in and say, what's that?
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.500]   Leo, the port show.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:29.500]   You could find it.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.500]   You could find it.
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.500]   I have it pop up.
[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.500]   I don't know.
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.500]   I think there's something there.
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.980]   I think if they can make it work right and maybe this guy from sidekick Palm is going
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:38.900]   to work on this instead of Android.
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:44.220]   One of the most frequent questions I got at CNET when I was doing the real deal was,
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:46.820]   what is the best way to get internet stuff on my TV?
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.300]   And they were talking about video specifically.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:49.300]   There's no good way to do that.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.940]   Things like Hulu and Netflix.
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:55.020]   Like, we need that one box that makes it easy to get everything.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:59.380]   And that is what Google was saying they intended to do was, we don't care if it's over the
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:02.740]   air coming through cable or satellite or the internet.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:06.180]   We're going to make one interface that says, you tell us what you want to watch?
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:07.980]   We'll put it up on the screen for you.
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:10.860]   And if they actually deliver on that, I think that could be pretty revolutionary.
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:13.980]   I don't know whether they will as much as they promised.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:17.820]   Well, and I'm hoping that this is the first step in like all a cart television down the
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:18.820]   road.
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:19.820]   That's what we all want.
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:20.820]   Right.
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:26.100]   We only want to be able to pick those channels and not have to pay a Comcast.
[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:29.180]   The other thing that will be interesting is, look, no one's going to want to do Twitter
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.740]   on their TV.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:34.900]   No one's going to be posting status updates on the TV because the TV is a group experience.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:37.620]   You're going to have your iPad or your cell phone or for whatever for that.
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:43.020]   But for a large screen experience, whether it's video or something else, why not?
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:47.780]   And I just said, there's a great YouTube show out there called Annoying Orange.
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:52.340]   And I think it's really, really funny and cool and it's really annoying and stupid.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:53.540]   But I just said it.
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:55.100]   So now, how are you going to go find Annoying Orange?
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:59.180]   Well, you can do it on Apple TV, for instance, but it's a pain and I've never done it.
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.180]   It doesn't work that well.
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:01.180]   So and then imagine--
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.180]   So the devil's in the deep in implementation.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.740]   Give me your phone, one of your phones.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.260]   Well, I love the idea that you could do with a phone.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:08.940]   So then the thing you do is you're watching your TV and you're like, hey, can you find
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.460]   Annoying Orange for me TV?
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:11.860]   And it pops up and there it is.
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:12.860]   That was part of the demo.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:13.860]   And that's what it's all going to do with these things.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.860]   Yeah, that was part of the demo.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:15.860]   I broke it.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:20.860]   Who was it was talking yesterday sometime that he said, we'll see.
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:21.860]   We'll see.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:24.140]   Direct TV promised this kind of integration never delivered.
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:25.620]   We'll see if Dish really does this.
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:30.180]   We'll see if Sony really does this or if it's just a lot of people kissing up to Eric Schmidt.
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:34.620]   Yeah, you know, the thing that scares me is if you put it in your television, I talked
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:39.740]   to the guys at Roku, the CEO of Roku, who said, look, we did nine software updates in
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:41.460]   the fourth quarter of our Roku group.
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:42.460]   They just did one this week.
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:43.460]   Right.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.820]   And on the television, these guys are not set up to do software.
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:49.580]   We're doing this Yahoo Connected TV platform at Revision3.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.100]   We're going to roll it out.
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:55.180]   We got a Sony Bravia TV to test it on the 2009 Sony Bravia TV.
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:56.180]   We put it on.
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:57.180]   We're like, video's not working.
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:59.100]   We're like, man, we screwed up on our app.
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:00.100]   We call up Sony.
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:03.020]   It's like, oh, video doesn't work on the Bravia 2009.
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.940]   And we're like, okay, can you get a software update for us?
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:08.460]   You know, and they're like, oh, no, you have to buy a Bravia 2010.
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.540]   You didn't even have a video to work on the thing.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:13.180]   It's like, look, that is not an answer for a consumer.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.180]   Right.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:16.380]   Well, and that's that's my TV.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:17.380]   I just put a new Samsung.
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:21.060]   It's the first TV that I've ever owned that actually does, you know, software update.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.220]   The 75, the 7500.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.220]   Is that what you got?
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:24.220]   I don't know which one it is.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:25.220]   But what the Yahoo widgets.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:26.220]   It'll tell you when there's an update.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.420]   It has all the guy who widgets and all that stuff.
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.420]   I think it's a 7500.
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:30.660]   Flash the firmware and reboot it.
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:31.660]   It's pretty cool.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:32.660]   I get all that stuff on my TV.
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:33.660]   I just need a gateway media center.
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:36.500]   Apple TV, Roku, Sony PS3, and Xbox 360.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:40.140]   Hey, what about the rumors that Apple's going to do a $100 Apple TV that's streaming
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.900]   only no storage running.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:42.900]   I have a small box.
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:45.220]   A small flash storage, right?
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:47.220]   Yeah.
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:52.420]   I think that is a really interesting way to bring this platform into reality and out
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:54.500]   of the hobby for two reasons.
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:58.580]   One is it says, hey, we're going to start a cloud storage system for you.
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:00.020]   So you don't have to worry about that.
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.020]   That's the only thing I'm holding time.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.020]   Nope.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:06.380]   And I think the cloud can also be your home network because one of the ways I use Apple
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:10.740]   TV right now is I just stream stuff off of the various computers we have because I don't
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:12.620]   want to store it all in this tiny Apple TV.
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.620]   I bought the first generation.
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:15.540]   Kevin, you've always been good in the Apple rumors.
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:18.820]   You think we'll see this June 7th when Steve Jobs takes a stage?
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.980]   I heard that they were working on something to compete with Spotify.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:24.260]   So a streaming service, a streaming music service.
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:25.260]   It's like a party of time.
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:26.260]   Like, blah, blah, right?
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:27.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:28.260]   Right.
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:29.260]   That's a good point.
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:32.700]   So that's actually what they would probably use as their web interface for that.
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:33.700]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:36.820]   Well, we're going to see a lot of great advances on the TV connecting up to the internet.
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.300]   Look, Boxy is coming out.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.700]   The pop box is coming out.
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.820]   It's Apple thing, Google.
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:45.500]   We already have the connected Blu-ray players are actually pretty good for Netflix.
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.500]   M.B.D. Live and all that.
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.860]   Well, the Panasonic one actually has a really nice interface.
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:49.860]   It does because it's not nice.
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:53.060]   Roku now will let you choose your Netflix Instant Play movies from the Roku box.
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:54.380]   The Roku is just there.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.620]   Continue to do great stuff with UFC and other things.
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:38:00.780]   And if you don't have a Roku, get it so that you can watch Revision 3 and Twitter on Roku.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.780]   Yeah.
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:02.780]   I mean, it's a really great way.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:03.780]   And streaming's coming.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:06.900]   We keep being told that we are going to have streaming on the Roku very soon.
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:07.900]   Yeah.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:10.700]   I mean, they just they're doing all the tests with UFC, the ultimate fight stuff.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.180]   And they've been doing live streaming there.
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:14.020]   And it may be like baseball streamed last year.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.900]   And the major league baseball experience is awesome.
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:16.900]   It's really good.
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:20.860]   I gave up direct TV, extra innings where I was paying a couple hundred bucks a year for
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:21.860]   the Roku one.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:22.860]   You know who's smart?
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:23.860]   It's a hundred bucks.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.900]   MLB is smart because they get the hundred bucks there.
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:29.820]   You pay 30 bucks for the iPad app and you can watch the streaming on the iPad.
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:30.820]   You can watch.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:33.740]   If you're a baseball fan, major league baseball, it's funny.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:37.220]   For a long time, I thought David Stern was the was the bright guy at NBA.
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:38.220]   MLB has leapfropped.
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:41.700]   Well, it's made major league baseball advanced media, which is a separate company for Major
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:42.700]   League Baseball.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:43.700]   Very small.
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:44.700]   Very small.
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:46.660]   And it was a smart move on MLB to say, you guys know what you're doing.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.660]   You go and do it.
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:48.660]   Well, and they're going right.
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:51.300]   Like the boxy Major League Baseball app is also very good.
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:54.780]   So I want to see football do that, but that'll be a lot.
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:55.780]   It does.
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:56.780]   It does.
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:57.780]   I mean, you have to have direct TV.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:58.780]   I have the TV app on my iPhone.
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:38:59.780]   Right.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.740]   You have to have game streaming on the iPhone.
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:02.940]   I have the same thing.
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:03.940]   Exactly.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:04.940]   I have direct TV.
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:07.900]   It works, but I want to see them do it where I don't have to pay direct TV.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:13.420]   Now this is that suburbia thing because the app, they control it entirely versus maybe
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:17.540]   something like sling where you have a sling box and you could watch whatever is on your
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:18.700]   TV on your iPad.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.340]   And they are going to do an iPad app.
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:26.540]   So that's the interesting thing where if I'm Major League Baseball, I prefer the suburbia.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:29.420]   I prefer the gated community because I get all the revenue.
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:33.580]   I control the experience, Major League Baseball on the iPad is spectacular.
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:36.900]   What they did, there's this really clever too, as they said, it's only one subscription.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:39.540]   Once you buy your MLB TV of suburb, you can use it on the ROCA.
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.940]   You can use it on the iPad, but they charge you for the iPad app.
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.340]   So they do get a little more blood on the box.
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.620]   Yeah, but it's nicely done.
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:46.620]   Oh, the Giants won.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.620]   That's good.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.620]   The Cardinals.
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:49.620]   Kevin Rose.
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:50.620]   You know what?
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:58.780]   This is how Twit started was, and you were there, Kevin.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:04.700]   Because we were at the 21st Amendment brewery right after Mackerel in 2005, and it was just
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:05.700]   like this.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:08.380]   We just sat around BSing and it was so much fun.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.340]   And here we are 250 episodes later.
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:11.340]   I'm so 250.
[01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:13.500]   Kevin, I'm so glad you could be here.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:14.500]   Thank you.
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:17.580]   Jim Latterback, Tom Merritt.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:19.340]   It's been really, it's been really fun.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:23.420]   And Kevin, you come back now and you got dig four and we can't wait to see that.
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:26.140]   I'm going to drive out and we'll hang out at the college.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.140]   Oh, good.
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:28.740]   That'll be really nice to have you.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:29.740]   Kevin Rose is at dig.com.
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:35.740]   He's the CEO there and this will be the, this is your first big CEO thing you're going
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:36.740]   to do.
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:37.740]   This role.
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.740]   Not for long.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:39.740]   Trying to find a replacement.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:41.740]   Oh, you're the eye CEO?
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.740]   Yeah, I'm the, yeah, exactly.
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:48.140]   I'm basically going to fill those chupis for another couple of months until we find someone
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:49.140]   full time.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.460]   So you're doing such a great job.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.820]   I don't know if the board will let you.
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:53.820]   We'll see.
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:54.820]   We'll see.
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.220]   We're proud of Kevin, aren't we?
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.220]   He's done kidding, man.
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.460]   He's done so well.
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:40:59.460]   That's really neat.
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:00.460]   It's really nuts.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:01.460]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:02.460]   Tom Merritt.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:06.500]   So excited June 1st TNT makes its debut on the Twit Network.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:10.900]   Go to TWIT.tv/TNT to subscribe.
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:12.900]   In fact, it's already climbing up the charts on iTunes.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.500]   Yeah, last I looked at it as number three overall in the US was number two in Canada.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:17.500]   And there's no shows.
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:18.500]   No shows on it.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:21.380]   No shows on the feed, but you are hot.
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:23.980]   You mean overexposed or?
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:25.780]   Yeah, I don't know exactly what to say.
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.540]   Anyway, Tom, we'll see you.
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:28.540]   On Tuesday.
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.700]   Yeah, we can't find one with Becky Worley.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.700]   Sarah, I'll be here.
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:32.700]   I'll be here.
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:33.700]   It's going to be a party.
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:35.940]   And maybe you can come to Jim if you want.
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:38.180]   On Tuesday, I'll be with Kara.
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:40.100]   Ah, you're going to D.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.100]   Yes.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:42.100]   Boy, what a lineup there.
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:43.580]   I'll hit you up to be a guest on one of these.
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:44.580]   Don't forget me.
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:45.580]   Yeah, I'm happy to--
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:46.580]   Steve Balmer is going to be there.
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:50.020]   Steve Case, Julius Jannikowski, the Chairman of the FCC.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.420]   This is D not tech news today.
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:54.660]   Steve Jobs, Alan Malali of Ford.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:55.660]   He's a great guy.
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:56.660]   I really like Alan.
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:58.660]   Jesse Aussie from Microsoft.
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:02.700]   Oh, the co-founder of Demand Media, Richard Rosenblatt.
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:03.900]   Let's ask Kim some questions.
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:04.900]   Let's give him about how they're going.
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.580]   Hey, some interesting questions.
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:09.940]   President of CEO of NPR, Vivian Schiller.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:10.940]   Mark Zuckerberg will be there as well.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:11.940]   That's going to be fun.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:12.940]   Are you going out to D, Kevin?
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:13.940]   I'm not.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:14.940]   Now I'm saying Italian.
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.620]   I'd have to work on.
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:19.060]   I would think if you were, your name would be on there.
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:22.500]   Kara, and we were hoping that Kara and Walt would join us today, but they just got too
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:23.500]   busy.
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:24.820]   We'll have them on another time.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:25.820]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:26.820]   Thank you, Tom Merritt.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:28.820]   Thank you, Jim Latterback.

[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.820]   It's fantastic in the new gaming show.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:36.820]   Food, food mob.
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:37.820]   Food mob, I forgot.
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:38.820]   Good.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.820]   Awesome show.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.820]   You get an every night.
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:41.820]   You get an aisle on some time.
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:42.820]   That guy is awesome.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:43.820]   I'd love to.
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:44.820]   He's awesome.
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:45.820]   I'd love to.
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:46.820]   That'd be great.
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:48.820]   revision3.com.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.820]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:50.820]   We thank you so much for joining us today on Twit.
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:51.820]   We hope you'll come back.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:52.820]   You can watch the show live.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:53.820]   We do it every Sunday at 6 p.m.
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:54.820]   Eastern, 3 p.m.
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:43:02.260]   on your twit.tv, a web page, the Twit app for the iPad, the Twit app for the iPhone.
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:06.300]   Soon to be on other platforms near you.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.020]   I guess that's all there is to say.
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:09.300]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.300]   See you next week.
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.300]   Go ahead, Sam.
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:12.300]   No, no, no.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:15.940]   There's a way to pull a cork out if you're having trouble with it.
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.980]   It involves putting it between your legs and pulling.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:19.980]   Right.
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:23.340]   That's why I wasn't going to say it.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:25.620]   But Leo, of course, egged beyond.
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:26.620]   I did.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:29.620]   Of course, it didn't take that much egging.
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:31.180]   Let's go around.
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:34.460]   Have we started the podcast?
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:35.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.460]   This is the podcast.
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:39.460]   We're on a bottle of wine.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:40.700]   We can start now.
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:43.300]   I just didn't want to start while she was straining.
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:45.060]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:46.300]   I can talk and strain.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:47.300]   Okay.
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.300]   All right.
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:49.300]   It's time for Twit.
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.300]   The show.
[01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:51.300]   Go ahead.
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.300]   Sorry.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.300]   That's enough.
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:54.300]   Be my guest.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:55.300]   Just speak now.
[01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:56.300]   I'm ready for Twit.
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:57.300]   Speak now.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:58.300]   It's good.
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:43:59.300]   Let's join.
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.300]   Have a twit.
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:01.300]   If you leave it like that and put it back in the mini bar, do you think they'll charge
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.300]   you?
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:03.300]   Yes.
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:04.300]   Have a cork.
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:05.300]   Have a cork.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.300]   Have a cork.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:07.300]   Have a cork onward.
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:08.300]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:09.300]   All right.
[01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:10.300]   Do it in the Twit, baby.
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:11.300]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:12.300]   All right.
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:13.300]   Do it in the Twit, baby.
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:14.300]   Do it in the Twit, baby.
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:15.300]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:16.300]   Do it in the Twit.
