[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He kind of lives under the desk. It's a great thing.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   >> You know, it's actually pretty comfortable after you get used to
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   the squishiness.

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   so I am looking around.

[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   They had some new high def stuff,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   so I'm just exploring all avenues.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   >> You know what we've decided to do, and I'm kind of excited about this.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   We've decided not to be exclusive anymore.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   We were exclusive with Stickam, and the problem with that is a single point of failure, right?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Stickam goes.

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So we're going to be on You Stream, we're going to be on Stickam,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and we're going to be on BitGravity.

[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Can I call it Gagit or GDGT?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> GDGT.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm calling Gagit if you want.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   >> It's actually probably better to say GDGT.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   >> It's a little more distinctive.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   >> Yeah, and that phone call in the background, that's David L. Prager.

[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Maybe he got a home invasion.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Maybe somebody broke in.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   That wasn't going to be our top story, but we'll get to some other stories.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I think one story very interesting this week, and you know,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I'm not sure if I put it in the rundown.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   George Stephanopoulos is going to interview former presidential candidate
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   John McCain, now Senator from Arizona on Twitter.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Now, the question is, is it a Twitter view or is it a Twitter view?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Both of them sound terrible.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> Yeah, they do.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> How can you interview somebody in 140 -- well, I can see the questions
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   could be 140 characters.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   How could John McCain answer in 140 characters?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> So, essentially.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> So, what's the point is the bigger question when they're both living in the same town,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and he could just walk over to his studio.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   He's got a studio, I'm sure that Stephanopoulos should set in Washington, D.C.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   >> So, this stuff is really good.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   >> Just a gimmick.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   This is out-and-out publicity stunt gimmick.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   >> It's going to work.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   >> I agree.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   >> I agree.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   >> I'm not going to follow it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> This Twitter stuff's gone too far.

[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   >> Well, you know, John McCain is now far more active on Twitter than Barack Obama.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> He is.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   John McCain -- I don't think -- >> Yes, he is.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   >> It's not a staffer.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   What do you think, Bonnie?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Do you think it's really him or --
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I can't tell, really.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   His tweets are kind of weird.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> They're very general.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   >> They're policy tweets.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   >> Sounds like the staffer to me.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   >> What's the story?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I mean, this Twitter thing is getting big some day.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I think they're going to have a future.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   >> Well, Leo, by the way, you were mentioning this recently, and I didn't notice this
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   before where they do all of a sudden Twitter itself as recommending people.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> And they recommend -- the numbers go flying.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It's like, why are they recommending anybody, and why are they recommending these people?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Do you have to pay them?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   >> Jason Calicanis did an interesting thing this week.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   He Twitter'd -- I hereby offer Twitter a quarter of a million dollars if they will put me on
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   their suggested list for a guaranteed two years.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And his thinking is that that's a guaranteed million followers, right, at least.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.600]   So when people who are on the suggested list are adding right now about 10,000 followers
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.000]   a day, so it's millions.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's basically -- I mean, it's huge.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And he says, this is worth money.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And I asked him, I said, Jason, are you serious?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Or is this a joke?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   He said, I'm serious, but really, I'm just trying to help Evout by establishing the price,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   because this is going to happen.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   That's what this is all about.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> Yeah, I figured he was just throwing it over there.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   >> Your suggestion is that the system is corrupt.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   >> Well, it's a little corrupt right now because neither you nor I are on that recommended list.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   >> It'll be up on the up and up once we're all -- once we all been recommended.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   >> Yeah, as soon as they -- no, I don't want to be --
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   >> Well, we complain the less likely that's about to happen.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   >> Yeah, I -- you know, it's interesting who they put on, but even more interesting who they didn't put on.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And I -- we've talked about it before.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I just think that it's setting up for the way that they're planning to monetize.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   When, you know, the number three person right after -- okay, number one, CNN.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Number two, Barack Obama.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Number three, Britney Spears.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> And she wasn't getting any traction before she was recommended.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   >> I mean, she was -- >> All about the recommendation.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   >> But what I'm saying is, is this what Twitter wants to be seen as, as the Barack Obama and Britney Spears channel?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   >> But I don't know if -- I think there was a lot of people that added it, but I think that there's also a huge number of Twitter --
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Twitter-ers who don't even follow those two or many of the top 10.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   >> No. In fact, I'm happy to have -- I just crossed 100,000.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I'm happy to have that number without the inflationary suggested list because I know those are people who's actively sought me out.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   >> Right. I think that those numbers, those 240,000, are newbies who just kind of add, "Oh, well, I'll just put some people on."
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Because there's a lot of people that are coming into the Twitter market because of things like this interview with John Pan.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   >> Not just that. Ellen DeGeneres this week.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   P. Diddy talks her into creating the Ellen Show tweet.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   She's now in the top 10 or top 20.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   >> Yes, ridiculous.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   You know, the funny thing is I got a bunch of male bitching about the fact that we even talk about Twitter at all.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And the fact that they've gone off in this direction, which is just basically corrupt,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I think we should just stop talking about it and get to real news and we'll just let this slide.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   >> Good. Deal with me.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I messed up last week. I didn't mention the fact.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I ran out of time and I forgot to mention the fact that President Obama named a federal CIO, the guy in charge of technology, for the federal government.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Probably good that I didn't.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   >> He wasn't there for very long. >> Probably a good thing.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Vivek Kundra, who was the Washington, D.C., chief technology officer, had to step down.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   At least temporarily. It seems that the day President Obama announced his appointment, or shortly thereafter,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   the FBI raided his office, arrested too as part of a bribery sting, including his number two, Yousifah Kar, and Sushil Banzai.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   They say, no, Kundra is not implicated in any way. Nevertheless, I think quite wisely, he said,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   maybe I better take a little leave of absence.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   >> He was a lot of it out. >> The timing was a little bit suspect, wasn't it?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   As soon as he becomes CIO.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   >> Okay, let's go in now. Let's go in right now. Okay.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   >> It just seemed a little bit convenient for me.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   >> What do you think? I mean, why would they try to take any idea?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   >> I have no idea. I can't think of any kind of motive. There's something that we don't know that will explain everything.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That's the way I'm looking at it. >> Well, let me throw something in when you say the timing was bad.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I mean, it's possible that the FBI was going to put this off forever with these guys.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And now they got access to the deeper, deeper part of the White House or whatever.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   They had to move in. I don't think it was a timing thing necessarily.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   There could be some big deal. Then again, the whole thing could be just a scam.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   But I suspect that they had to do it because now these guys are moving in deeper.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And if there was something they were doing that was corrupt, they have to move immediately.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   >> Also, they haven't stated that he is not under investigation.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   >> They're not quite clear about that. >> Yeah, so they've been really clear.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   It's not about him currently. >> But can I say something?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   It tarnishes the whole office.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   If his number two is being arrested for bribery, it's like saying, yeah, Madoff's wife,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   wife didn't know a thing about it. It's a little suspicious.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   >> You're either corrupt or inept. >> Yeah. Yeah.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Either way, it's not so good. >> Right. >> Yeah.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   >> Well, anyway, I'm glad I didn't bring it up last week.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Because the story got enriched. Speaking of enriched, we've got David back.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   >> Sorry about that. I don't know what happened with you and someone else's house.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I guess you should reset their mode of everyone's house. >> That's okay.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Move your iPhone away from the microphone.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   >> Oh, can you hear that? >> Yeah. I got to talk to David because David,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   this week, we're going to take a break and I'm going to ask you about this.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   David, this week did the most amazing thing and it's very typical Web 2.0 behavior.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Guy breaks into your house, passes out in your bed. What do you do?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Oh, I know what you do. You start a Ustream feed, send video out and Twitter it.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   We got to find out what the hell you were thinking, David, in just a second before.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   >> No, no, no. That's called a tease, David.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   >> It's a good tease. >> What the hell was David thinking?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   We'll find out in just a moment. But first this word from Squarespace.com.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Sarah Lane, I know it's sitting right next to you, David.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Her blog is now on Squarespace. I notice Kevin. Kevin Rose is on Squarespace.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   I started talking to these guys. I was really impressed with the technology.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Squarespace is, I want to say a blog engine, but it's really more because they have
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   incredible templates for photographers, for instance, that you get automatic,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   light table and all that stuff. It's just beautiful.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   We're moving some of some of our. >> Are you? Yeah.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   We're going to be moving a bunch of stuff to Squarespace.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   We're going to move our company blog over there inside Twitter.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I'm talking to them about maybe even more because it's so cool.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It's so fluid. >> And also the web building tools that they provide.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   >> Yeah. >> Which makes it absolutely incredible.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And I had no idea they're sponsoring. I'm thrilled.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Because we've had people that sponsor some of the things that we do.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And sometimes you're a little bit less excited in what they have to offer.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'm really excited to talk about and really excited about what they can do.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And then the Twitter is the perfect show for them to go after as well.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   >> It's kind of a neat story. >> It's kind of a neat story.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I'd never heard about them before. And everybody pays attention to WordPress.com
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   and typepad.com and Vox and Tumblr. And I hadn't really heard about them.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   So I talked to the guy behind Kinsen. >> Doldane.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   >> Doldane. >> And then that guy who built the entire platform.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   >> The guy who did it. He was a young guy. He's like in his mid-twenties.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Oh, now I'm going to mad at myself. I can't remember his name. I'll find it.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   >> I was trying to think of it. >> I was so impressed at his thinking in this.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And what's kind of neat is he has designed something that is really easy
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   for anybody to set up a blog. And this is what blew me away.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   OK, easy import from WordPress and typepad and the blogger.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   But also export back out into it. So it's not a one way. It's not a Roach Motel.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   A lot of sites, I'm not going to name names, make it really easy for you to get your blog in there
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and make it impossible to get out. >> And I think that one of the things that
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   we're looking at is for a handful of support sites for some of our shows.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   We're looking at using Squarespace because we don't want to have a single developer
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   that we have to, you know, it has to be their time.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   If they're not available or something isn't there, there's going to be a group of us
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   that can make adjustments, change things, administer the entire thing
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and change the entire structure if we need to without anybody with very much technical experience at all.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   >> Let me read you an email and then we're going to get to David's story.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   >> It's Anthony Castellino. >> That's it, Anthony.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   >> And he custom built the entire thing and he did such a darn good job of it.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   They didn't even have to take a dime of funding. He just built the whole thing.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   >> Yeah, that's right. >> Got Dane on board.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   >> And it's a phenomenal platform. >> It's, you know, it's cool.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It scales very well. They have this virtual machine technology that you never run out of band with.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It just add more and it's, and everybody benefits when they add one more machine.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Everybody benefits are very clever. So let me read you.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Phil Gray just sent me an email. He said, just a quick note to say,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   "Well done on picking up the sponsorship deal from Squarespace.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I was listening to the Twit podcast Monday night Sydney time
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   whilst looking at some options to build a website for a new business venture.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I'm about to launch. I heard you talk about Squarespace.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   I've been playing with it for three days now.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   My site will be ready to go live early next week. The plugins are great.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   The whole experience feels very slick, but most importantly, their tech support is first class.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I'm so impressed. I've upgraded to a paid tier one account.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   That's the top account. Just three days into my trial period.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And by the way, you got that 10% discount too.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   So, Phil Gray, PCCoaching.com. I'm going to give you a plug, Phil.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And invite everybody to go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Squarespace.com/twit. You could try it free for two weeks.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   If you sign up, 10% off when you use our names, squarespace.com/twit.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   We thank them. I'm really glad to have them on board.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It's really interesting how sometimes something like this could just grab everybody's attention.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And the whole community goes, "Yeah!"
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   You know, it's kind of like the right thing at the right time.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   So, David...
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   [laughter]
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   You left your door open. Do you live in Patero? Where do you live?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I live in Patero Hill, yeah.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Okay. Not a great neighborhood.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   You know, Patero Hill is weird. It's one of the greatest neighborhoods in the city,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   except what they call the North Slope.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   It has some of the best views in the city.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Oh, I love it. And it's warmer.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   It's banana. It's really banana belt. It's beautiful.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Yeah. But once you get in the South Slope, I mean, you really almost get into the "projects" even within a few blocks.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Well, we were there. Tech TV was there.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Oh, look, Alec.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Tech TV was a few blocks away.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   We would have armed robberies once in a while in front of Tech TV.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Remember, David, yeah, the guy puts the revolver up his nose and says, "Give me your laptop, sir."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But we had the neighbors next door that hated us.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   The neighbors next door to the studio that hated us.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Remember them?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Yeah, they hated us.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   They had that big dog.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Oh, man, they had like a Doberman with it come out. It scared our guests.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Who was that scared?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   We had a guest come out. I yelled at the guy.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Dude, we're trying to do a television network here. Our guests come out the door and your Doberman attacks him.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   There's a leash law in this town. Oh, he was awful.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And he would always park like a Ferrari or some other designer car kind of sideways across the front of the door.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I was a little suspicious about his bit. He was a construction guy, but it's something else going on in there.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   I don't know what was going on.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Anyway, you leave your door unlocked. Again, I don't know why, but you're a trusting guy, right, David? That's it.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Well, if you've really seen where I live, it's up an alley and there's a small little patio.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And it's private enough that I'll just leave things on the patio that I know could get stolen, but it's not a big deal to me.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And in the three years I've lived there, nothing has ever been taken from there.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   So I'd say darn near 20% of every night. I probably just kind of don't lock the door.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   I do now.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   So what happened?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Was this Thursday night?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   It was, I don't know what night it was, maybe Wednesday of last week or something.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I'm reading about it the next day. There's a lot of tweets.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   But some guy wanders in.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Yeah, so I guess what no one's done. I'm surprised.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   There's a lot of feedback. And you think about journalism a little bit and you realize that if people are going to be writing things,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   and they're having a platform as a blogger or even as a more journalistic entity that's been around a lot less than a lot of people.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And you think as a news gatherer you would go and seek the source before you report.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   So I'm kind of surprised about how many people would say things and their sources were the commenters rather than like why don't you try to even email the person who was involved.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I kind of don't care that much.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   You know, if people want to say things about it or not, but I'm surprised how many people say things as a journalistic entity without actually looking for sources,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   which is like I'm right here.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   So you mean a lot of these newspaper stories they never even contacted you?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Oh, no, no, I was contacted by ABC. I was contacted by, I think that's it.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   This is a good test.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Two places contacted me and everyone else including the register, a newspaper in Sydney and a couple other places.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   You were in the UK. You were in the English papers.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I was surprised. I was surprised with the reaction. However, if I think back at it, the novelty of what I was doing seems like it's newsworthy.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   So, you know, it does make sense.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   It does worthy. Okay. So the guy wanders and passes out in your bed.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   You do.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   No, he didn't do that.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   First he went to the bathroom.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   So what I was getting at by saying no one contacted me is no one actually knows the full story.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Oh, good. That's your answer.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Because no one asks.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I came home at about one in the morning. I'd been with some friends who I hadn't seen in a while.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   So I came home at one. I hadn't slept a lot since the time change.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   I'd been getting about five hours of sleep and sometimes four.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   So I was pretty tired.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   So I come home, walk in the door one in the morning. I sit on my couch and the lights are on.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I live in a studio apartment. I still live in a tiny studio apartment, which is funny, but I still do.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And so I sit on the couch and I fall asleep while sitting on the couch.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   So I've got all my clothes on. The lights are on. I'm sitting on the couch. I fall asleep.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And so, you know, I didn't even lock the door.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And yes, I sometimes leave it unlocked because I don't think to do it.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But so I guess I was asleep for two hours, two hours pass.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   And I wake up because I hear a rustling of my door opening.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And so I see a person walk in. And as I see this person walk in, I'm trying to get my senses of I'm waking up.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   What's going on? Is this someone I know? What's going on?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And then by the time I am fully awake and cognizant, I see a guy very much, I don't know if he was awake.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I don't know if he was inebriated or drunk or what, but completely out of control and stumble past me and into the bathroom.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   My diagnosis from watching the video was Quayludes.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I don't know. Maybe. He didn't even smell of alcohol, but by the time he had B.I.O.O. I know you twittered that.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Yeah, I did say that. So by the time I was cognizant, I saw a completely out of it, completely out of control and not with himself, individual, stumble, barely able to walk.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Into my bathroom. And so I sat there dumbfounded and I thought, really? Did that really just happen?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   But immediately because of the fact that he was so out of it, I didn't feel threatened.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And so I totally agree with a lot of the people that said, "You should have called the cops."
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   No, no, no, when did you do? You whipped out your iPhone and you tweared.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Yeah, so I thought, "Yes, maybe I should have called the cops."
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   But the reason that I didn't, the reason I didn't, I'm saying shouldn't have, but I kind of am okay with not having done it.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   The reason that I didn't is because I did not feel at all that my safety was in danger.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I could say, I felt more in order to hide.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   The first tweet is, "Okay, maybe I should lock my door. I swear a random dude just walked into my bathroom and I can't believe I haven't freaked out."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   That was 3.14 a.m.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   So what was going through my head when that happened is I thought, "Okay, there's a guy in my bathroom. I don't feel threatened.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I kind of want to go to bed and now I'm annoyed that there's a guy here."
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And then the next thing I thought is, I've got a phone in my hand and, just like you, and just like most of the people listening to the show, have a Twitter account.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And so once I had my phone in my hand and I knew I had a Twitter account, and luckily I have a decent number of followers.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   You have a lot more than I do.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I thought, "This is very ironic and strange."
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Your first impulse was not to call the cops.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Well, my first impulse is, I think your first impulse is, "Am I okay? Am I worried for my safety?"
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Like, what the hell is going on?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   If I was worried for my safety, I guarantee I would have either punched the guy in the head or called the cops or run.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And I wasn't concerned for myself.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And again, granted, maybe I should have been, but I wasn't.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And I thought, "I'm not worried about myself."
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And as soon as that is alleviated, then I'm going to start telling people about what's going on.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   He was, I think, strange.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   He was relatively well-dressed, right? He didn't seem like he was a street person.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   So I don't think he was homeless. I think he was out of it.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   He was a stomber.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   He was out of it. He had been on drugs. He had been partying or all of whatever kind of the above you want to add in there.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And so I twittered the first one, and I hit refresh from my phone.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And I automatically, even at three in the morning, I had five or six or seven responses.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And so then I started leaving my stream of consciousness on there.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   I'm like, "Well, maybe I'll go in there."
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   And then I thought, "He was still in there."
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And so I even said something funny. I said, "Well, there's no toilet people in there. Maybe that's why he's still in there."
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And then once I realized that I was giving a blow-by-blow on the phone,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   and I really wanted to do something, because quite frankly, I wanted to get him out so I could go to bed.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And obviously I wasn't calling the cops by that point.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And part of the reason I didn't is because I felt safe, and I didn't want to have to deal with the cops coming over,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   riding a report and doing all that.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   So finally, as I'm doing the blow-by-blow on Twitter, I realized, "Well, I've got a computer with a camera and a microphone."
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   I can set up a Ustream live feed in about ten seconds.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   You're so web 2.0.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   So I did it. So I did it. And if anything, if something happens, you better believe they're going to see it.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Something bad happens.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   That's why I never worry. Because if somebody's going to off me, at least they're going to do it on camera.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   So I feel safe.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   So now that I think about it, the people that were actually, a lot of people read it the next day, the most of the people did,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   and saw the video, which I should have captured, but someone was screaming at Tom.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Yeah. But if I was seeing this as it happened, I can tell that it would have been quite riveting.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And I'm surprised about how many people-
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   People thought, David, that it might be a fake because it was so compelling.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   It was like, "Well, maybe this is just some sort of staged event."
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And that makes sense that you would think that. You know me.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   No, I don't think you staged it. Kevin knows me and Sarah knows me.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   The people that know me like, "Oh, that's just Prager."
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   That's just Prager.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Exactly.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Sarah's over there.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Prager dreams and well 2.0. That's the message.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   I love it that he had that instinct.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Why not would you have done that? Would you have turned on a camera?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I think I would have realized I just hit somebody and they were on the floor.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I need to call the ambulance.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   I would have told the guy to get out.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Hey, can I make a long story longer and ask Prager, what was the resolution?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Did you ever find out who this guy was?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   She said you didn't know if he was homeless or a bomb or a guy who stepped in the wrong house.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   The video showed...
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I guess he got in your bed and the video shows you dragging him out of the bed and talking to him.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   So I yanked him out of the bathroom. He was on his feet.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And as I yanked him out of the bathroom, the bed was nearby and he fell over on the bed.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And then I probably said a couple of dumb things. I said, "Dude, I think I was using the word "dude."
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   There was a lot of dude.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I think I used the F4 a couple times too many.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   But he fell over on the bed and I said a few things.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   And I was kind of dumbfounded that I've got this guy lying on my bed.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And for some reason, all you can see is his box of shorts.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   He took his pants off.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   So you never called the cops. You just got them out of there.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   He didn't speak English. He tried to talk to me. He wasn't speaking English.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Yeah. And I think maybe he did speak English, but he was so messed up that he wasn't able to speak English.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   He was on Oxycontin or something.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And what was funny is, I mean, he came back to try to get in.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And first, again, I did pants in your house.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And I didn't feel threatened. I almost thought it was, you know, I knew I had a U-stream going.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And so I looked at the camera and I said, "This guy's trying to get back in. This is ridiculous."
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And I could tell, I mean, he was a fantastic actor.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   But if he was and he had ulterior motives, he certainly would have accomplished them.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And he didn't try.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   So I think you were punked by Kevin Rose.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Kevin Rose.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   So I was pretty blown away by the response.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   But, again, it does seem like the novelty.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And I never really considered myself quite the child of the web to a movement.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   But I guess I did what people in our positions might sometimes do.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   More than you thought.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Maybe it's one of the Rev 3 layoffs.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   There's people commenting that said that, you know, I was a Darwin award.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And then there's also people commenting saying, "Some people said, 'I can't believe you're so nice.'"
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And at the same time, some people were saying, "Have you no compassion for human beings?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   You kicked him out and he might have been dying and you didn't call the name of it."
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   So some people wanted me to beat him up and send him to the hospital.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And other people said, "I had no compassion for human beings because I didn't do anything to help him."
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And then other people like, "Oh, you're so nice."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   You're going to end up sued by the guy for invasion of privacy.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   His privacy, you watch.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   This guy's going to get you in court and he's going to take you for everything you're worth.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   That was what I...
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   My reaction...
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   It's funny, John, you and I must have been hanging out with you too much.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Because my reaction was that if anything happened to this guy after you threw him out, he could sue you.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   You know, if he walked to the street and got hit by a car, your biggest risk was not from this guy, clearly.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   It was from his lawyer.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   His lawyers.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Maybe, well, to this day, I have no idea.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   And I was almost...
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   You'll hear from a lawyer shortly.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Don't worry about it.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   I'm surprised that no one has recognized this guy from the video.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   I don't know.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   He seemed like...
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   I mean, the video is a little bored, but he seemed like a good-looking, well-dressed guy.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   You know, he was a partier.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   He was a portrayal partier.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   I was telling Andrew Bancroft to host one of our shows that he really looks a lot like Andrew Bancroft.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   But it's not him.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Well, hmm.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Well, anyway, congratulations on surviving.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Thanks.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   The case of the mysterious intruder.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   I had a mysterious intruder.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   You did?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Me in my backyard.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Really?
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Yeah, but you live like on a big bull heart.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Yeah, it turned out to be a raccoon.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   But I walked down.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   I think I...
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Mine was like a Twitter too.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I was like, my wife says there's something in the backyard.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   I have to go get it.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   If I don't get it, if I don't get it, if I don't get it, if I don't get it, it's called the police.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   It's going to be a Twitter issue going on here.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Sure, it wasn't seismic.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Could have been a seismic wreck.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Yeah, no, I went out a night and I walked out with a flashlight and a knife thinking, you know, this is the beginning of some horror film where you're going, why is he doing this?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And then it turned out to be a raccoon.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I thought that my backyard was his.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Oh, it's the yard.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   There's someone in the house.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Yeah, it's accurate.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Get out now.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   So, Leo, I got to ask you, I listened to the show.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   It could have been a time of time of not every week.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   And how much of the show is talking about Twitter now?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   What percent?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   We're going to stop.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Stop.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Stop.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I want to stop.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   We all want to stop, but we can't.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   That's the problem.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Twitter is like that.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Well, you keep on trying to use other services, but there's just nothing else.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Well, the chat room says 99.9%, 27%, 50 dollars.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I don't know what the 50 dollars is.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I think in general, I think in general, everybody's just tired of hearing about it.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And when they do hear it about it, it skews the conversation.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   We can be talking about it for 10% of the show.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And it sounds like 80% because it's everywhere.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   I mean, it's on Martha's store for goodness sake.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   It's on every five years ago.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   When everyone got sick of us talking about blogging, it's exactly the same thing.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   I would say, yeah.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   I mean, Peter, you were there for the emergence of the blogs.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   I mean, in gadget was, I would say arguably still the winner of that.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   I like to think so.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   I mean, so it does remind you that.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   It reminds me a little bit of that.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   It reminds me exactly the same.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And everyone five years ago, everyone was, you know, complaining about blogs and people
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.160]   need to shut up talking about blogs and people writing columns about how they're sick of
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.000]   reading about blogs, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And Twitter is kind of the same thing.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.440]   It's a publishing platform that everyone's really excited about and everyone's getting
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.000]   sick of because we're all over saturated with it.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   I think the thing about Twitter is it's kind of counterintuitive.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   At first sight, it seems much less than it is.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   And then you get hooked and then it seems like much more than it is.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   And I want to make an announcement to all the listeners out there that I tried.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You tried what?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.600]   To get the conversation off of Twitter.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.600]   All right.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   Ed bot.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   Let's get the conversation on the Ed bot.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.000]   John, what do you do?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Go ahead.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   My reason everyone uses it and talks about it so much is that if you're like a john or
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.800]   like me and you have a lot of people following on Twitter, you want to talk about, you want
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.840]   to be able to use it as a broadcast mechanism.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.120]   And because of the fact, because of that, then you continue using and talking about
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.120]   it.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.440]   You know, I realized this week I had a kind of a come up.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.240]   I mentioned, I just tweeted a little tweet, oh, I'm about to hit 100,000.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.880]   You know, it seems prize worthy.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.760]   And I got all this heat on friend feed people saying, "Shut up.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.840]   Who cares how many people?"
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.760]   And I realized talking about your followers is like talking about how much money you make.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.560]   It's just goosh.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.640]   It's like don't, but Twitter encourages, you know, they put it front and center.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.680]   You're back on track.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   Being goosh?
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.280]   No, talking about Twitter.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   All right.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.960]   So what did you do?
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.720]   Ed bot was a friend of ours.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.280]   We had Ed bot on the radio show a lot.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.280]   He's a nice guy.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.280]   Ed bot.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.480]   Like I don't know what they pay him at Microsoft, but he's a hit man, apparently.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   And I was looking at this.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.080]   He did a story, he says, I'll tell you, because it's about me.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.520]   The war against Windows 7.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.440]   Horaby wrong.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.640]   I wrote a little column in market watch saying that if this thing isn't a big success, Microsoft
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.560]   has got some issues in the future and investors should be aware of that.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.920]   That's basically the theme of the column.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.360]   Which by the way, I agree with.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   Of course.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.480]   But anyway, I mentioned a couple of things.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.920]   I said, I don't think this is the finished code.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.960]   I think that everybody's all jacked up about something that's pretty streamlined and it's
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.640]   going to probably the likelihood of it being as fast and nifty as it when it gets released.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.680]   And especially after a few patch Tuesdays is probably pretty low since Microsoft has
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.280]   a bad reputation.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.080]   He basically goes crazy and says, that is, in fact, I'll say the last he goes into some
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   quoting me.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.680]   He says, he says, that is to put it as kindly as possible.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.680]   Pure crap.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.640]   The security features you see in beta release seven are those you will see in the final product.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.360]   The idea that there's a pile of code being held back is ridiculous.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.200]   Which begs the question, why don't you release the product?
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.400]   Now, here's what really got me at the end.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   He has an update.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.280]   If you want to go back to his blog, you'll see it.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.760]   He says, I went back and read the column again.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:08.480]   Another page view, by the way, by how crude and juvenile the writing is.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.720]   But no matter what I've seen, comment threads from anti-Microsoft.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.680]   I wonder if JCD is having this column ghost written.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:24.200]   So I decided to do a little research on Ed's charming writing.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.680]   And by the way, he did the exact same thing against Chris Perrillo commentary when Vista
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.200]   came out and Ed was doing the same pro Microsoft crap.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:40.000]   And the reason, of course, is Ed's real income comes from writing books about Vista.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.360]   And he obviously has books ready to come out on Windows 7.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.600]   And he thinks that anyone who says anything negative will probably hurt sales by two or
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.480]   three books.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.200]   And he's just very upset about it.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:58.360]   And I also think he gets a memo from Microsoft saying, hey, look at this.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.840]   You should do something.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.840]   And he does.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   And then he doesn't do enough.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.240]   And then another note so he doesn't update.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.520]   I mean, it's basically, he's just a Microsoft stooge.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.680]   So there.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.240]   End of story.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   How?
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:19.600]   I noticed that the same now, we do a Windows show with Paul Therat, who I love and I think
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.920]   is great and I think his integrity is 100% or I wouldn't be doing a show with him.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:29.160]   But I do notice that he and Ed are similar in one one respect.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.840]   They come, they blow hot and cold on Microsoft.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.080]   And sometimes it's like you're attacking mom and apple pie.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   If you say anything about Microsoft, it's negative.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.320]   We know Mac users would never be that way.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.280]   Well, I guess we're the same way, aren't we?
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.920]   Yeah, it's just the same way.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.000]   Both of these camps, by the way, accuse me of being all your Microsoft go, oh, you're
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   anti Microsoft.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I mean, I don't get it.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.240]   I never saw more hate than when John saw the word exactly the same thing.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   Do you?
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.000]   Ryan and I, yeah, Ryan and I get it constantly.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.120]   Whenever we say anything about about Apple, all the Microsoft, it's like people are like,
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.120]   people go nuts.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   It's everything.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   You know what is bias is in the eye of the beholder.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.840]   It's always that way.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.640]   And I think whenever some you, you know, people try to accuse someone of being biased or having
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.960]   a secret agenda or something like that, you really have to kind of like look at it from,
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.680]   you know, where your own preferences lie.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.840]   I see this all the time.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.560]   I mean, someone got on my case last week on GDGT weekly.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:22.360]   I suggested that if someone bocks at the price of the new iPod shuffle, they might want
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.320]   to look at something like, you know, some of the devices from Sandisk.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.920]   And some guy just like, Slam went ballistic on me for it.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.120]   That was like some sort of nice way.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.400]   I mean, they're good alternative.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   They're very affordable.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.360]   And, you know, you don't have to give up a screen or anything like that.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.480]   You know, like you do with the shuffle in the sky, which is like, it was like, like,
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.480]   I, you know, blasphemed.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.480]   How dare you?
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.680]   Don't you know the iPod's the best thing in the world?
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.320]   Well, the thing is, and it follows, you know, the Ed Bot colony follows with his followers.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.320]   We're a bunch of Microsoft Stooges too.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.040]   You know, with the typical anti-divorac stuff, which is interesting, I really think the guy
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.360]   needs to change careers.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.080]   This guy Robert says, and another guy says, well, I believe it's time for Mr. Devark to
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.680]   be put out to pasture.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   Move.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.080]   And then another one, of course.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:14.120]   And then Mark Justice Hinton says, I was surprised to learn Devark still has a column,
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.600]   which is like, always, ho, ho, these guys are so funny.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.840]   So who said that?
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.840]   Never ends.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.720]   But the fact of the matter is Microsoft, I am not buying into all the propaganda that
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.000]   Windows 7 is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.800]   They still haven't fixed a lot of things that were broken and in this that they promised
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.560]   years ago, and they have never implemented.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.040]   Who was it said that the lower the stakes, the higher the, you know, the battle?
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.800]   I mean, there's really, let's face it.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.240]   There's not a whole lot of difference between.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   I mean, they're all computers.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.000]   The DNA is 99% the same.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.200]   And another thing I am.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   We're 99.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   We're almost 99.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.160]   We're almost 99% the same as Chymunkeys.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.320]   By the way, I am targeting Ubuntu now as something to really seriously look at.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   Good.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   I love Ubuntu.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.680]   I use it all the time.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   It's a.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.080]   But anybody does anybody here on this various steam to establish panel use it full time
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.160]   as their desktop OS?
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.200]   I could do it.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.040]   You could use it actually.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   You are.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   Here's what I want.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   I work.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.720]   I think you should use it for a month straight.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.240]   Nothing else that the lens is.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   I could do it.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   It's not a problem.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.680]   Except for one thing I had, there's one missing piece of the puzzle, which is going
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   to be a problem.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.680]   Here's the rub.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   Adobe.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.600]   Oh, you use Photoshop a lot.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.080]   You get to learn the game.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   You can use GIMP.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.800]   GIMP does not do the job that Photoshop does.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.640]   You can use the online version.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   Photoshop.com.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640]   You could do.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640]   Or Aviary.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.080]   Peter, you use it full time?
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   You know what?
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:47.040]   I actually wanted the few people who uses Windows Ubuntu and Mac on a regular basis.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.040]   You know, I live in the browser.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.520]   So at this point, it's just what's really matter now.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.520]   It's just what I do now, does it?
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.080]   The thing about it is the first thing I did when I installed Windows 7, I just installed
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.880]   Firefox.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.480]   And we're going to talk about 99%.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.120]   99% of the stuff I do is in the browser now.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:10.440]   You know, Twitter works the same on all of them.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:17.560]   So I switched over from being a PC user to using a Mac about three years ago.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:22.200]   And Windows 7 is the reason that I went and bought a PC about two weeks ago.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   Because I wanted to go back and start using it again.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   And I think it's great.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   I like it quite a bit.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:31.760]   Now, again, I'm not using it for quite the extensive reasons that a lot of people do.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.080]   But I think it's a pretty solid operating system.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.720]   And I think that also that, you know, it doesn't have the bugs and it doesn't have a
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   lot of the issues.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   But what about what John was saying?
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.640]   Do you think it's going to get buggy as soon as they put everything in that they've left
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.640]   out?
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   Or have they--
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640]   I don't know.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:52.000]   But there's so many-- what I realized when switching back to a PC and I still use a Mac
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   is that there are so many more applications available to PC users that I forgot about.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Games.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.680]   Because I was only using the Mac stuff.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.440]   When I granted, like, in the past three years the number of Mac applications is skyrocketed.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   But the PC--
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.440]   You just want to play Craig live.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   I know why.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:14.480]   Yeah, but in becoming a Mac user, I forgot about the benefits of using-- quite frankly,
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:19.120]   the benefits of using a platform that 90% of computer users use.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   I'm with you on that.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.520]   I actually like Windows 7 a lot.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   I think Mac--
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520]   It's what Mac wears for us as far as I can say.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.320]   I think Mac users are the most likely to be happy with Windows 7.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.080]   It feels clean and straight, simple and almost-- I hate to say it, Mac-ish.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.560]   And I'm not sure I agree with you, John.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.560]   I mean, I'm--
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.560]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.720]   Before you've not agreed with me, let's back up a few, like, a year or so when Vista
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   first came out.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.080]   And you said the exact same thing about Vista.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.080]   And Kevin Rose was on the show going on and on about how great Vista is.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.760]   Kevin, baby, but not me.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.760]   Well, everybody was going on about it.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.480]   So just like a Mac, it's got Mac characteristics.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.960]   And they never used it, of course.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   They played with it.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960]   And you're--
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.880]   I think Vista on the surface was appealing.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.440]   And then as soon as you did really start to use it, it was like, oh, god.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   Well, this is the same thing.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.760]   No, no, I have Windows 7 on all my systems now.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.760]   I've been using Windows 7 since--
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   All right.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.440]   Until they start updating, it went to get a few of these patches.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.600]   And then it will give me-- give me six months and we'll see what happens.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.600]   All right.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.600]   So I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.600]   I can find one or two good tools that does it very well.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   When Windows, I can find 40 or 50 tools, maybe only three that do it very well.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.600]   They're all ugly.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   That's how Mac uses it.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   Every time I open up an app, I'm like, "Why can't they just look at the interface just for a couple minutes?"
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   I do recognize that they're all tools.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   I got Windows.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   I got Linux and virtual machines now.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   I used to have a Linux laptop.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   VMs are great.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   VMs mean you can do anything you want, really.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   If anybody wants to try Linux,
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   I say go for it because you'll find that some of the compromises don't apply to everybody.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   Some of the things that don't work may not bother you.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   Everything is in the browser now.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   Everybody's been saying.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   I don't think it's going to be that big of an issue for John.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   Honestly, I don't.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   We're actually considering developing some turnkey systems where Linux is really the only solution for us.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   We develop a lot of our software is actually written in Objective-C.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   It's written straight to OS X.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   The Pixel Core?
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   DV Garage, my other company.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.600]   We make keen software and a lot of other things.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.600]   One of the things we've been playing with is some turnkey boxes that do a lot of the stuff that we do.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.600]   Our solution is, as we look at it, there's not a lot of ways to avoid just writing in Linux
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   because we just need to have complete control over the box,
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.600]   be able to build it from scratch with a lot of extras.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.600]   That is one of the big advantages of either Windows or Linux is being able to customize the hardware a lot more
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.600]   than what you're going to be able to do on OS X.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   That said, I'm not my laptop I'm quite happy with.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   Well, I think they're all about the same and there's minor differences.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.600]   There's one major difference we have to always take into consideration.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.600]   Exactly.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   Windows is outrageously expensive, but nobody buys Windows.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   They just buy a new machine and it comes with Windows.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   Same for the Mac.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.600]   Well, you buy it.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.600]   You can go to a lot of computer stores and just buy an OEM version of...
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.600]   But I'm just saying people don't really do it.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   Mac users do it because they want to run an VM.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   But most Windows users get it when they buy a computer.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   They never buy another edition until they buy the next computer.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.600]   Well, yeah, but it's not the end users necessarily that have to eat it.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   It's these big corporations that have 10,000 seats and they have to buy the last...
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   They're still using Windows XP.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.600]   At some point they get...
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   Yeah, they have to.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   That's really the game.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   Microsoft has to come up with a way to force you to upgrade.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:50.600]   Well, but the big thing is that always every time someone's forced to upgrade, then they get into...
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.600]   There are smaller companies, maybe not the large ones that have huge infrastructure, but especially as a bunch of these...
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.600]   A lot of these companies are moving more and more towards software as a service.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.600]   And a lot of their infrastructure is going online.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   They can make a decision of, you know, we can go to, for instance OS X.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.600]   We're going to move over and it's not... or Linux, but especially...
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   We can change it because a lot of our executives like iPhones and then the iPhones.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   Watch this. Watch this.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   Watch this.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   It's cloud computing, right, John?
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   Sounds like it.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   Well, no, I was waiting for like the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the... the
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   Well, no, I was waiting for the fuhrer or the storm.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   I'm not speaking to someone who's a big fan of cloud computing now.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   You are?
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   No.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   Yeah, my world is rocked.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   I'll say I'm not a big fan of it personally.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   I think that it has its place that's a... that's a compromise I've made.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:51.600]   I'm going to talk about something that is totally exciting to me that I think is going to change it.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   But I think is going to change everything.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.600]   And it has to do with cloud computing.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   It has to do with Google.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.600]   Voice.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.000]   Let me talk about voice in a second.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.600]   I am so excited about this.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   I also want to ask you, David Prager, why Kevin Rose hates me?
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.600]   Because...
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.600]   Why does he hate you?
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   What are the symptoms?
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   Well, I'll tell you the symptoms.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   I know he hates me now.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.600]   He's got to do it.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   I'm...
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   I'll tell you in a second.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   He's got a new website and I can tell.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   I'm not getting the love from Mr. Rose.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   Does it have to do with application development?
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.600]   No.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.600]   We'll talk about it in a second.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.600]   But first I want to mention a minute.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.600]   See, I'm getting so good at these teases.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   I'm really getting good at these.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600]   You're teasing me here too.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   I have no idea.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.600]   Oh!
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.600]   So, I want to talk about Go to Meeting.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   But from the folks at Citrix, Go to Meeting is an amazing program that means you can travel less.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.600]   You can meet more conveniently.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:52.600]   We use Go to Meeting now for one of our shows, you know, Ray Maxwell's up in Vancouver.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.600]   And he wants to show us screenshots when he does his Maxwell's house show.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   Go to Meeting.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   It's amazing.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   He just sends an email out to me.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   I click the link and suddenly I'm seeing his computer on my desktop.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   He can show us the drawings that...
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:09.600]   You know, I mean, if you're in sales, imagine this, you know, instead of having to travel across country,
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   sitting in the middle seat.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.600]   I know you don't do that.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.600]   But for those of us who have to go through security, take off our shoes, all of that,
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.600]   this is...
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.600]   You don't have to do that anymore.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   You just say, "Hey, get them on the phone.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   This got free voice conferencing built in, both VoIP and teleconference.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   Get them on the phone saying, "Go to GoToMeeting.com."
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   They enter it in.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   Suddenly they're seeing your computer.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   They see the PowerPoint, the presentation.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.600]   You'll increase your productivity.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   You'll close more sales.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   You'll do more.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   You'll travel less.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.600]   I just love it.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.600]   Set it up in a couple of minutes.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.600]   In fact, if you do it right now, you'll have it set up before the show's over.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.600]   Go to Meeting.com/Twit.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.600]   Go to Meeting.com/Twit.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.600]   You'll try it free for 30 days, by the way.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   A month of meetings, unlimited, online meetings, absolutely free.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   And if you decide to sign up, you'll find this is the most affordable solution out there.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.600]   Easy to install, easy to configure, easy to use, easy to pay for.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.600]   Go to Meeting.com/Twit.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.600]   I use it.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   Encourage you to, too.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   There's software as a service.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   Well, you know that's cloud computing, isn't it?
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.600]   Come to think of it.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   Well, because what I was going to say is that I haven't been a big fan of it.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.600]   But as I see more and more of what some of these guys are doing, I start going.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.600]   Oh, I mean, when you look at whether between what they're doing, what Google's doing, what
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   Salesforce is doing, you start going, "Well, maybe I should do more of this."
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   I think Google just tipped, did the tipping point.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   I think this Google Voice, I'm going to go way out in a limb here.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.600]   And John, I'm ready for you to shoot me down.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   Peter, you can shoot me down.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   But I had a Grand Central account.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.600]   You know, I was just collecting dust.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   I wasn't using it.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   I too.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   Converted it to Google Voice.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.600]   Unbelievable.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   They haven't given me my conversion code yet.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.600]   Me neither.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   Just saying unbelievable is not selling me on anything.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.600]   Okay, let me tell you what you get.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   So, first of all, you're now you have one phone number that you're going to use forever.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.600]   This is your single phone.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   You can, an unlimited number of other phones forward it to.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   If, it uses your Google contacts, which they kind of rolled out secret, kind of covertly
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.600]   in Gmail a little while ago, I have groups.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.600]   So I have a family group.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.600]   I have a Twits group.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.600]   I have a Work group.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   I have Unknown, you know, people.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   You can have different messages for each group.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.600]   You can have different responses for each group.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.600]   So when, when my family calls, they get a custom answering machine message.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.600]   They can ring custom phones.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   They can get screened or not screened.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   If somebody I don't know, it's not in my contact list calls.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.600]   They get screened.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.600]   They have to say their name.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   I can listen to them leave a message or if I want.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   Then this is the best part or one of the best parts.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   The messages are transcribed.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.600]   Machine transcription is not perfect.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.600]   An SMS to me or emailed to me.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:45.600]   So I have it set up so that when you call me, if I don't know you, I don't even hear the
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.600]   ring.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   SMS is me your message.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   I can call you back from the SMS message with one click on my cell phone.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.600]   Now, I can also call my Google phone number and get free calls anywhere in the US.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   This is the thing that I think is going to change telephony.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   Free calls anywhere in the US through Google.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   They're undercutting the price on Skype on international calls.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.600]   It's actually cheaper than Skype.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   SMS is free.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   Text messaging is free.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   How does this connect to Android?
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   That's going to be the next, you know, the other shoe.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   Maybe Peter will have a thought on this.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   But right now it works with any phone the way anything else would.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   But if they put an Android application or an iPhone application out with this thing,
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   see, I don't think they will because I think AT&T would quash it.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.600]   This is a huge thing.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath for a bunch of reasons.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   Do you think Peter, this is a threat to the phone companies?
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   It would be if Google would follow through on anything these days.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.600]   You might be right.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   I think that they have a attention deficit disorder right now when it comes to stuff.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.600]   I mean, look at Android.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   I mean, the fact that they've really been very slow on iterating with Android.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   And there's this lot of, I mean, it came out a little prematurely that I think that it was
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   a little underdeveloped when it hit.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   I still, you know, and also the G1 is such a crappy piece of hardware that it doesn't
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   do Android justice.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   It's just too slow, I think.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   Yeah, I mean, I use one and it's definitely very sluggish.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   I mean, Android just is an operating system.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   It needs a lot of polish.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:16.600]   And I think that you can sort of see that Google, I mean, they're hard for them to keep their
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   focus on so many different things at once.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   And so the idea that they're going to integrate Google Voice, I'm not saying they won't do it,
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   but I think that's going to happen a lot more slowly than any of us would like.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   So I have a question about what Google does.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   Why is Gmail still in beta yet?
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   The Chrome browser came out of beta within two months.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   Why is Chrome not in beta still?
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   Because they don't even have a freaking OS 10 version.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.600]   Well, the better question is, what does it mean that they're in beta?
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.600]   It's meaningless.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   Does it have an email?
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   Hey, leave us alone.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   Yes, and excuses.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   Like if this thing screws up, it's not our fault.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.600]   It's in beta.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   Wow.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.600]   I mean, I just think that.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   Isn't that what that means?
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   No, I don't think it means anything.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   Chrome can screw up.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.600]   Well, something in beta means that like, hey, we're all stuck.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.600]   That's what it used to mean.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.600]   I think the new meaning is empty, meaningless.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.600]   Thanks to Google.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   Thanks to Google.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   Everyone uses the term beta because of Google.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.600]   I mean, like it existed, but people always know it's Google puts things out in beta.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   And so everyone calls their applications in beta.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   And even their like products, like some of them really, I wouldn't be surprised if Ford made a car
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   and called it beta because they didn't know if the gas economy worked well or not.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:32.160]   Well, in some ways, though, I think it'd be someone who developed software calling something
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:36.920]   beta for us works out really well because we get some less pressure and we get a much
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.360]   higher sample rate.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.360]   So we can handle a bunch of stuff and people will get out.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.800]   What does it mean with that we move out of beta in a month or two?
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.680]   Yeah, but this is a web service for one thing.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   It's not soft.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   It's not.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   But it's still there's a bunch of things to roll.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.320]   You know, there's a bunch of things to eat.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.680]   No, I think that the Gmail thing is a little silly.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.280]   But at this point, it's not beta.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.280]   It's not.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.400]   And I think that there is something that has been very useful for us of being able to release
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.920]   something that we call beta.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.640]   Now we could probably call it gamma, you know, which is like, you know, we've already
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.440]   beta tested because usually when we've done it, we've already it's already been tested
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   by 50 people.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.240]   But this is this is Twitter.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.240]   Zeta.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   I just want you to know.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.240]   I don't know.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.080]   I think that's that they've made the term they've effectively made the term meaningless
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:22.360]   by being a beta for so long with Gmail and in England, it's called beta.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.360]   Beta.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.360]   Do they say beta?
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.360]   That's weird.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.720]   Don't they know Greek?
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.160]   Don't we know Greek?
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.880]   That's what they said.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.960]   I'd say, don't you now, Greek.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.600]   So what do you think about this?
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.120]   Has anybody else played with Google Voice or is it just me?
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.360]   They haven't upgraded me yet.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.320]   When I got into Grand Central, I had big view.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   I had a big.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.320]   Grand Central was a disappointment.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.320]   Well, I just I just couldn't quite get my head around it completely.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.880]   Is it easier to get with Google Voice?
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.880]   Is it?
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.120]   Get into it because I've been looking at what I'm going to do this with.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.360]   I've been wanting to do this with our office number.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   They completely redesign it.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.120]   I should show you, but I will after the show because it's got my phone number all over
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.120]   it.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:02.240]   But I should show you, although I have to say the machine transcription is machine transcription.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.160]   It leaves a little bit to be desired.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.160]   I tested.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:13.440]   I left myself a message in which I said, Hi, this is Leo.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.400]   And I would like to know if you when you're coming home for dinner and it translated to
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.120]   Hi-Ass, ideally.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.600]   When you come.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   And then that was his fun.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.960]   And I knew I mean, obviously, look at that.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.040]   That's a mistake.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.720]   But then it says, when are you coming out for dinner instead of coming home for dinner?
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.200]   That makes a big difference.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:35.000]   I think I'm going to leave a message that says, Hi, this is going to be transcrypted
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.080]   by a machine.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.240]   So speak slowly and clearly.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.800]   I spoke pretty clearly.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.000]   I don't even think it.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.600]   It said Hi-Ass, ideally, oh, instead of Hi, it's Leo.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   Oh.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.640]   So it looks better when you show it on the screen.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   That's a big difference.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.360]   See how bad that is.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.360]   Wow.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.680]   Now, what's interesting is you can see there's different like some of the words are dark
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   and some are light.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.320]   There's obviously some information here.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.040]   The darker ones are the ones that it's sure of and the lighter ones are the ones that
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.200]   it's less sure.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   I hope so.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.200]   It's sure as sure of Hi-Ass.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   I don't know.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.480]   No, no, that's still great.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.680]   And then I wonder if you're coming and then out for so they actually looks like they have
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:21.920]   three shades of gray, dark if they know for sure, light gray if they're not sure, and
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.440]   then very light gray if they're pretty sure they got it wrong.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.320]   Why don't we just conclude it sucks?
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.120]   Well, can you teach it?
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120]   No.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   Can you teach it in the terms?
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   I don't know.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.120]   I don't think so.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   It's just out now.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120]   It's good enough.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.880]   No, no, it's good enough because what it happens, I get a text message.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.480]   It says who it's from.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.760]   It says roughly what they said.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.600]   I know what the message is about.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.040]   I can play it back on the web interface.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.120]   The other thing they did is Grand Central's web interface was opaque.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   This is Google.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:55.640]   Believe it or not, I don't think Google's the best UI company, but they did a pretty
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:56.960]   good job of making this very nice.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.160]   And I definitely think as some kind of app, we're going to be able to check our messages
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.360]   and so on and so forth through some kind of iPhone app.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.960]   So it's going to be this nice little interface.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.960]   That will be interesting.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.560]   It's visual voicemail, but better.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.960]   Yeah, I think.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:13.520]   So I think if I'm a phone company right now and I've heard from some people that the
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.880]   phone companies are a little nervous about that, what do you think, Peter?
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.000]   I mean, this is really your area.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.960]   Well, I think that this is the one thing that the carriers are always worried about as being
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.840]   disintermediated and having people figure out ways to completely route around them.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   It's all bits now, you know, and you can't sell services.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.840]   It's all bits.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:37.560]   Yeah, but though I think that there's still some issues with doing VoIP over a data connection,
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.360]   like over a wireless data connection.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.080]   I mean, you're going to have some latency issues that you're not going to have when
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.120]   you're using the voice channels.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.200]   So it's not quite there yet, but it's getting better.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.200]   And you actually see some of the carriers overseas being a lot more open to the stuff
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.760]   than they are here in the US.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.600]   Because I think the carriers overseas have resigned themselves to, they are that you're
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.760]   paying for the pipe.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   And that's what they're selling you.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:05.000]   It is not as overseas characters, carriers don't seem to be as connected to trying to
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.240]   get your minutes or even the content that you get over it.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.920]   They just you literally are simply paying for a pipe to your phone.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.400]   Yeah, no, that's the thing.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   And the carriers here, they really don't want to become just a dumb pipe because they kind
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.760]   of realize that that then they'll all be commodified and then just erase to the bottom
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.920]   in terms of pricing.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.480]   I think we're actually going to see that anyway.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.480]   You see that T-Mobile will be a lot more aggressive.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.040]   It's it's all in one price.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.960]   So yeah, I mean, I think this is going to be a big deal.
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:37.440]   I will say with respect to Google Voice is that I've had Vonage for since 2002 and I've
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.680]   had the ability to have one number forward to like five or six different lines and have
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.520]   the voicemail transcription and stuff like that for a while.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.120]   So a lot of a lot of those big features are something that's been available from other
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   service.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.800]   30 bucks a month or 25 bucks a month.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.280]   Well, I pay the 15 because I don't I try not to talk on the phone.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.360]   No, I use something called got email that gives us boxes.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.520]   All sorts of cool stuff.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.480]   But I think the price is zero is a big deal.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:06.480]   Plus low cost international calling is interesting that you say that the US carriers are more
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.120]   worried about this in the international carrier because it's my understanding that Google
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:13.280]   has no intentions of offering this anywhere but the US.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.320]   So they've said no, US only.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:20.160]   Well, I think it might have to do with the pricing for doing all the the termination
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.960]   and the the regular.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.880]   I just think this is very exciting.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.680]   I think Google is is this is I agree with you.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.960]   I mean, look what they did with dodgeball.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.680]   I mean, they completely killed it.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.560]   Then the guys go out and say, well, we're going to say, okay, thanks for the money, Google.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.360]   Thanks for letting us sit in the beach for two years.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.560]   Now we're going to start four square.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:42.720]   They're going to run out of children's games, but maybe not maybe not that quickly in the
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.720]   same way.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:47.360]   That's what everyone's using here at South by Southwest is everyone's like using for installing
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   four square.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.360]   Are there?
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.760]   Oh, yeah, it's the new Twitter.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:56.760]   And it's also because on Twitter on Twitter, Twitter used to be great at a conference because
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:00.280]   you could talk about where you are with your with your friends.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:04.800]   And now because they don't have enough features on Twitter yet, you can't talk about things
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.000]   you're doing for a specific group of people who are in an area because you've got a bunch
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.760]   of followers that don't care that you're in Austin and South by Southwest.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.920]   So then therefore you can't use it anymore to tell people where you are back to Twitter.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.920]   All right.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.920]   All right.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   Never had to continue.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.880]   I'm going to just change the name of the show.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:27.080]   Have you seen the really cool Pepsi Twitter visualizer for South by Southwest?
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   I think that's pretty sweet.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   I like the map the best.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.080]   Right now it says that because I guess it's looking for a lot of people who are watching
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.280]   I guess it's looking for the South by Southwest tags at South by Southwest.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.840]   991 people are traveling.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.680]   1141 people are drinking.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.640]   6,372 people are attending.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.160]   2500 people are eating.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.160]   476 people are connecting.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.160]   Isn't that funny?
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.160]   I just love it.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.160]   Oh, look, then you get a graph.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.360]   Why is this interesting to anyone?
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   I don't know.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.360]   Me and mainly you or anybody that looks at this.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.360]   Cool.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.360]   So we know there's 22.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.360]   22.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:00.360]   People drinking.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.360]   It's the colors, man.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.360]   The colors.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.360]   23.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   There's 23.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.760]   There's 24 people partying and 1142 drink.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.760]   What do we do?
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:09.960]   A bunch of tea toddlers partying.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.040]   I'm not getting these numbers as accurate.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:17.200]   You know, of course this information is worthless, but it's nicely presented.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   I guess you're right.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:22.040]   I want you hover on the bottom and get the menu.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:26.440]   And then there's one called, I believe it's called where people are.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:30.360]   I think that's really useful because it shows a Google map and it.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.040]   Party watch probably, right?
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   I think it's over.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   Yeah, I think that's it.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.040]   No, one of them.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.840]   So David, you're actually there.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:39.840]   Is anybody.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.240]   David, how many people are pooping?
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.440]   That doesn't sound good.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.440]   I tweeted out.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:52.520]   I said, I'm so sick of people twittering about S X W. So that, you know, you know,
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.800]   it's actually ruined Twitter.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.360]   You can't use Twitter because everybody's chalk a block with it with that.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.240]   And if you're not there, it's like who cares.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.000]   This one right here seems useful because I've seen a lot of tweets of people's.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.600]   Asking where is everybody?
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.960]   This is the swarm feature and it shows you a map of all these people.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   I mean, you people.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:12.360]   Exes where people are tweeting and then the, you know, like at Stubbs bar, at Driscoll
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.520]   bar, there's nine tweets and eight people.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.360]   So you could find out where everybody's hanging.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.360]   Yeah, go shoot them.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   Hey, it's K.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.840]   Leo, you got to come out here.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:28.360]   It is a lot of fun and it's absolutely your, your community.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.360]   There's something people.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.560]   Well, I know it's everybody I know are wanted.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.560]   I would love to.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.560]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.560]   Hold on a second.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:38.080]   I thought we were going to come back from the break with the, with the teaser and why
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.080]   Kevin Rose needs.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.080]   All right.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.080]   All right.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.080]   So I asked Kevin David.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.080]   I saw some people behind you.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.080]   Is Kevin there with you?
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.080]   Okay.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   No, he's not.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.080]   He, we just finished.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.560]   There's some shameless plugging going on on my screen here at Sarah Lane, S-A-R-A-H-L-A-N-E.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.360]   Where would, where would I find at Sarah Lane?
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.360]   What, what, what's that one?
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.760]   On a certain web app that we don't want to talk about it anymore, right?
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.080]   So Kevin's got, Kevin is a, I have to say, Kevin is very creative, one of the most creative
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080]   people.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.560]   He's just, he must just, ideas must spill off of me.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:12.440]   He's got a new site, which I guess they launched for South by Southwest called We Follow.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.080]   This is kind of a response to that, you know, messed up system that Twitter is using for
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.280]   recommendations.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:25.080]   You can tag, you know, tech, celebrity news and figure out who to follow on here.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:30.080]   Have I been tricked?
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   Yes, you have been.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   And we got you to ask for it.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.960]   Well, wait a minute, it's Kevin's site, okay?
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.080]   And I did the thing, you know, you're supposed to press a bone and I broke it.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.080]   Oh, it doesn't work.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   I was just trying to open it.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.080]   So everybody just said it.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080]   I broke Kevin.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   What?
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.080]   We follow.com.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.880]   Used to be there.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.440]   Now 503, 503 service and available.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.080]   Anyway, I'm not on the list anywhere.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.640]   And I did the thing where you go to, you know, to do this.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.840]   This is what your gripe is.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.480]   Yeah, because I don't think Kevin likes you.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.800]   I was going to say, what's this have to do with him disliking you?
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.960]   Because he won't let me be on the list.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:10.600]   I think I honestly, honestly, honestly think the reason that you're not on the list is
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.720]   because he is so ADD.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.040]   He didn't think about it.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   No, but I don't know.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   You will know him.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.200]   I know, but then, but then, okay, so I understand.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.520]   I'm fine with not being on the, you know, seated list.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.520]   That's okay.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.520]   I understand that.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.520]   That doesn't matter to me.
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.840]   But then I do the thing where you Twitter because everything is about like publicizing
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.840]   the site.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.520]   So you press a button and you do at we follow and you do your three hashtags tech.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.520]   I did tech.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.520]   I did news, I did radio.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.160]   I did that last night at 24 hours ago.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.120]   Still not on the list.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.680]   Okay.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.720]   I think that you should have a conversation with him.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720]   I love Kevin.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   He is.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   It's a very public conversation.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   He's my girlfriend.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.720]   He's my secret crush.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.720]   Now we're getting into this.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720]   No.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.720]   Anyway, enough.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.560]   I'm not going to talk about that anymore.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.280]   I just, oh, but when you just tease it a lot and we only talk about it.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.480]   Yeah, you tease the tea.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   No, that's it.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.480]   That's the story.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.320]   What else is there to say?
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   We follow.com.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.320]   It's a good idea.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.480]   It replaces that broken system Twitter is using.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.960]   Of course, Ev is going to take Kevin off the suggested list now because Kevin is undermining
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   Evan.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.960]   It's like high school.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.960]   It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.960]   it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like,
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.960]   it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like,
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960]   it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960]   it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like,
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:24.960]   it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's
