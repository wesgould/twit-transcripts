[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.240]   Hey, what's up? Thanks for having me nice to have you back. You're in I want to say New York. Yes
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.440]   I'm in New York. I'm in an office without any air conditioning right now
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.520]   So I apologize ahead of time if it gets a little if I get a little like warm, you know
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.000]   But things are going well. Yeah, how can you have an oh?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.540]   Because it's the weekend they turn it off. Yes the weekend
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.960]   I've usually decided to come back here for the podcast and I am totally regretting that decision now
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.600]   But I but I do have a nice cold beer. So
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.240]   So that is keeping me cool and hopefully will you know?
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.560]   Feed me with plenty of good thoughts during the show also here first time in a year and I'm glad to have you back
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.840]   In fact, there have been some changes made Dylan tweenie good to see you
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.280]   Hey, good to see you too. Yeah, you were at Wired Adventure Beat. What is what is a valley mail?
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.240]   So it's a security company does email security
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.000]   so
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.240]   Essentially it helps authenticate email so that you know when you're getting a message that you can be sure who it's coming from
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.840]   So now I'm thinking it's not pronounced valley mail, but valor mail
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.240]   Yeah, I kind of prefer valor mail, but you know if you want to call it Valley mail. Yeah
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.960]   Oh my god
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.520]   You like totally just the idea for my valley girl email
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.440]   So I'm like so upset. Oh my god. Oh my god. This is cool. This is really cool
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.240]   So see I use PGP to sign my mail
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.760]   But I know it baffles everybody say say what's this and I get I have to decide because there's a couple ways
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.040]   I could do it in line which puts a lot of gobbledygook in the actual email or
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   as an attachment and
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.560]   I've decided that people are more baffled by the attachment because they try to open it and they go
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.400]   I don't understand what's this P7 thing. What do I do with it?
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.520]   So at least if they see gobbledygook they go that's some Leo stuck some gobbledygook in there. Leo's trying to hack us
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.200]   Happening I think I was one tenth of one percent go. Oh, yeah
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.080]   Let me see if it's really Leo and so I know I shouldn't probably this would be a better solution
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.960]   I guess what I'm saying undoubtedly yeah, yeah, well I'll have to give it a try. It's for business though. It looks like
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.000]   Generally for business, but yeah, I can if you want if you want to set up to it with I think we actually
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.400]   I can help with DKIM and SPF and all that stuff we we have a smart IT guy and so yeah
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.840]   I believe our email is properly set up, but here. I'll tell you I'll tell you right now
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.760]   I'll do a little I've got an old prove me wrong
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.920]   Okay, first out of my phone. Is it twit.tv? Yeah, okay?
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.680]   My screen's very slow. This is very unimpressive now all of a sudden. Oh, so I could go to valormal and find out
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.640]   TV on your so insecure
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.040]   That would be good if you want Ashley will record that for you, okay, a hundred percent
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:27.160]   She's not a valley girl, but she can play one on TV should it need me I work in the valley there you go. Which valley?
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.920]   San Bernardino Valley you should probably not say that out the real valley girls
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.120]   I think they're saying I work in the that San Fernando Valley has different connotations in the rest of the world
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.440]   Well, that's Van Nuys. That's the valley, but like I'm in Burbank
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.600]   Beautiful downtown people. Yeah
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.480]   Leo your your SPF has some issues
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.560]   Oh, I know hey try Leo
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.140]   Ville calm see what happens in Leo Ville calm. I'm curious because that one goes through fast mail
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:07.560]   And I think fast mail has I've got it all set up at a fast mail not protected whatsoever. Okay. Thank you. Bye
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.160]   I'll be I'll be talking you. She's
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.080]   Never I'm gonna I was I'll do the rest after the show. I don't need to go through all my all my addresses
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.880]   Thank you though Dylan. I appreciate it. Yeah, no happy to help we covered we've been covering for the last week
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   And it's really been a death March
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.900]   The I you know, I have never said the guy's name out loud the Google engineer memo
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.680]   I that's all you have to say. I don't want to give him any
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.800]   Additional publicity although he has been now appearing in other media
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.840]   Wall Street Journal. We saw I saw him interviewed on Bloomberg TV Emily. I thought did a very good job actually
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:54.000]   But I think we can probably tie a bow on this now he's been offered a job by Julian Assange
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.080]   He's published an op ed in the Wall Street Journal
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.600]   Fortunately, it's behind a paywall
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.480]   Books in the New York John do you have it Brooks?
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.240]   The New York Times said he should be fired said soon our Pachar should be fired for firing him. I'm sorry
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.800]   Which is I think the most extreme in the other direction. Go ahead. I'm sorry. What were you saying? Oh?
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.560]   Yeah, I mean now that he's working for Julian Assange, it'll be happily ever after for him, right?
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.720]   They belong together. I don't know if he'll take the job, but they definitely belong together
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.680]   So but if anybody has it would be I think we it would be remiss if we're covering the week's news
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.600]   Not to mention that that's been in this news all week long and everybody's weighed in on it
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.680]   I've heard from every men's right activist in the world on Twitter
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.640]   Ashley you're a woman
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.640]   I you know what well you here's the thing I thought
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   I think I think a lot of men read it and kind of went yeah, okay
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.240]   Not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:03.600]   But just not offended by it like blowing it off ignoring it and I think every woman I know who read it was infuriated by it
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.040]   I you know honestly like my response was just like oh
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.720]   like I'm so
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.400]   It's this is exhausting like it's just
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.200]   Well, it's it's a lot of really great men and women coders engineers
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.160]   scientists I I think it's
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.240]   silly for anybody to say that you know
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.560]   You can't say that science says men are
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.600]   genetically better at that whatever, you know
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.200]   You can't say these things because you also have to take into consideration
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.080]   society and history and
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.560]   systematic oppression of you know people of color and women and it's just there's a lot of
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   different factors that go into this and and to just kind of make this weird blanket statement is I mean it's it's
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:00.840]   Obviously, it's it's ridiculous like it's silly and one thing some people said was well, okay granted
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.640]   This is whatever how you feel about it's dopey. It's insulting. It's wrong
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.440]   But should Google have fired him for that shouldn't they tolerate?
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.400]   speech that they disagree with
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.800]   So here's the thing I mean I think you can be a company that says
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:23.720]   You know if you're Google you should absolutely say you know if you have a political view that says
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:31.200]   We should spend more money on defense even though let's say Larry and Sergey don't believe that like that's fine
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.440]   Like I think that's fine
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.560]   But this to me is not a political viewpoint like this is a human viewpoint. This is a discriminatory
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.840]   viewpoint that is
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:47.160]   factually incorrect like and so to me that's the the line crossed like I think that if you want to donate
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.720]   To if you are anti-abortion if you are you know if that's a political view
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:59.200]   If you if you want to get into those things like and be involved in those things, that's fine, but at the end of the day
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:08.120]   Even if I was a person who who you know believed in all of some very like liberal stuff
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:14.600]   And then also wrote this manifesto. I would expect to be fired like that's it's you're you're literally one
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.880]   This man did not post this to medium or or write a blog about it
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.440]   He he literally disseminated it via email company email to employees in the company
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:33.520]   Which one as an HR person makes you completely you can't be worked with like you've created a hostile work environment for yourself
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.320]   Like how can you even continue to be employed? It's my understanding. Did he mail it was my understanding has been floating around on a Google
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.680]   Message board
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.320]   Well, they're internal Google plus and before that a Google meme site for a couple of months without any notice
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.560]   Somebody noticed it somebody probably noticed it and had reported him
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.040]   But I would imagine a large company like Google has a pretty serious long running
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:03.240]   You know HR process for letting people go well, and there's nothing wrong with being racist or misogynist privately
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.680]   I mean certainly there are plenty that exist in Silicon Valley
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.600]   But I think the problem here was that he wrote this down in a memo
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.400]   And it's the same thing as like if you wrote it in email even though that is it could be considered a
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:22.280]   You know a private message something that's sent between two individuals if that becomes public you're held accountable to that
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   So really you should put his name on it. Yeah, definitely he put his name on it
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.480]   And and you should treat all internal communications as though they are public and and so in this case
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:40.600]   He was he showed his flawed logic and I think for Google that is a liability because you don't want to have
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.240]   someone that is
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.640]   That's just making bad
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.600]   logical arguments publicly
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.040]   Especially if he's representing the engineers that work for your company
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.960]   So like that was a bad look and and ultimately yet caused it
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.640]   You know caused a huge controversy and so of course he was fired
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.480]   I think that it it's kind of silly to argue that he shouldn't be fired because like look at
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.680]   Amy Pascal from you know the Sony hacks, you know
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.280]   She wasn't responsible for the hacks and and sent a lot of weird and wrong messages
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:17.080]   privately, but once those were exposed she was held accountable and and this has happened dozens and dozens of times over history
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.880]   I think of you know, it was right for Google to fire the individual
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:28.640]   I think what was weird about his argument was just the pseudoscience that that he used to to elaborate his point for
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.280]   You know, I don't know like 5,000 words or something like that
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.920]   I mean the memo was way too long. I'm just surprised. I'm surprised that anyone would spend that long writing something for
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.200]   you know for internal purposes and
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.880]   And yeah, I just thought the logic was like completely flawed
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   What is this guy just?
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.960]   Had a little impedance mismatch. He thought he was in college still
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.920]   This is the kind of thing you could posit in college and then have a Socratic dialogue about and then be shut down or whatever
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:03.720]   And I think Google probably for a lot of employees feels like that kind of open a campus freewheeling campus environment
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.360]   They call it a campus. Yeah, you're not wrong, right?
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.680]   And he maybe just kind of thought oh he didn't think it was a company
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.480]   See I mean I understand from the company's point of view
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.600]   It's gonna be pretty hard to assign him for instance to be on a team with another woman if you were a woman
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.320]   You wouldn't want to work with the guy, right? So I
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.680]   Can understand why this isn't gonna work at a company
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.000]   But but Google kind of fosters this impression that it's a little bit more
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   open and freewheeling
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.080]   Yeah, that's true. I hope but I also I think that
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:38.920]   This sort of actually plays maybe a little maybe a little bit and I'm curious as to all of your opinions as to this
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.600]   So my my personal story of like the worst I've ever had
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:51.920]   harassment online was I used to be Android Ashley, so that's how I started hosting I hosted a show called this week at Android and
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.560]   See that's why you have to let robots subscribe
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:03.000]   That's so true and well the secret is I'm actually a robot so so the so I one year
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.800]   I was like, you know
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.440]   I probably should get a second line to see what's going on in iOS because I
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.600]   Don't really know what's going on there and I don't have any iOS devices
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:20.080]   So I got an iPhone as a second line and I think I tweeted about it or like maybe I posted about it on my space
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.360]   I don't even remember like no, it couldn't have been my space
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.680]   I think I tweeted about it and and I got emails from people saying they hope I
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.840]   They hoped I was raped while waiting in line for my iPhone
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:38.040]   They hoped that somebody had written me an email saying that they hoped the battery exploded and disfigured me permanently
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.480]   So that they would never have to see my hideous face on on screen again on their phone
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:49.680]   I mean, I got all kinds of just terrible messages many of which used the term I whore which I thought was clever
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   But also really horrible
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.120]   But yeah, it's like at the end of the day. I think that we
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.480]   We ascribe it is very easy
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:06.240]   To think that these companies whether you're an employee or a customer are our friends, right?
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:13.520]   So like which is why I think so many people get so defensive about the you know the Apple versus Android war and things like that because they
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.720]   Really consider these companies to sort of like be their friend and when they do things
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:25.320]   They that their that's their favorite company doesn't like they get even more angry then when you know, it's a company
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.160]   They don't care about you know, they it's a it's a it's a kind of a religious war
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.200]   It really is and they get so upset like a devout Android user would get really upset
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.960]   Maybe about this firing and be like Google. How could you do that?
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.200]   You know, it's like I don't I don't even know you and but it's it really is this sort of emotional
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.920]   Response and I think that's that's really kind of a big part of the response here
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.000]   And also the reason he wrote this is you know, you have this feeling of you know
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.120]   Well, this company I work here and we're all cool and and you know, Google's my friend
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.440]   And it's like but Google's also your employer
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.360]   And it's like and Google's also a business and they're out to make money and it's like you have to remember these things that I
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:11.120]   That it's easy. It's so easy to forget. You have to forget for employees apparently to forget
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.240]   You know, this theory also touched on something that that I wrote about a lot last year, which is that
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.600]   that there is
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.680]   there's under representation among a lot of groups in Silicon Valley and
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.960]   You know, this was at the heart of this engineers
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:31.240]   Memo the fact that you know that it was considered an anti diversity memo
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   So his argument was that it's it's really hard to find talented
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.920]   engineers and thinkers in certain groups such as let's say black and Hispanic and so that is why
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.480]   there is under representation among those groups and he argued that to
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.320]   to
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.640]   To hire people or to promote the hiring of those individuals would be to lower the standard for Google
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.660]   And so that's representable that is
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.400]   And and and you know, I think that
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.120]   That the reality is that that this this really gets to the core of something that's going on in Silicon Valley, which is that
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:18.200]   Companies like Facebook and Google and other conglomerates or you know, multi billion dollar companies are hiring from the same
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.720]   Very selective schools as they should, you know, these are very in demand jobs
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.280]   But what ends up happening is that you have small groups of about 20 people
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:34.000]   at least in the case of the trending topic story that I read about last year there was a group of about 20 people that
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.160]   That we're making decisions that influenced tens of millions of people's lives and even hundreds of millions of people's lives
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:46.520]   and and you know since even writing those stories I've been messaged by a number of different contractors and
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.920]   employees at different companies that are making decisions that they're uncomfortable with and
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.840]   are and that are unable to to really speak out and are unable to
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.640]   to really hold these companies to account and and
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.320]   Sorry the underrepresentation side of it is important because
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.280]   you know, you have this select group of
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.120]   recent graduates or very young people that are making decisions that
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.400]   that influence a lot of different people and when you don't have members of certain communities such as
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:23.720]   Hispanic or or black or or even a certain gender group such as women then
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.080]   You're not you're not building these
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.240]   algorithms or these artificial intelligence systems to take into account the
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:43.120]   the lifestyles and the experiences of these different people so, you know, one outcome for example is like Google images used
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.880]   artificial intelligence to identify what was in a photo and this was a couple of years ago, but
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:56.040]   This was a famous failure for artificial intelligence because Google images identified guerrillas as black people now
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.800]   Obviously, that's a huge problem
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.080]   But it's something that you can avoid if you have just one black person on the team, right?
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.440]   Like it just it's it you know
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:11.560]   You end up inserting biases that you don't actually mean to insert and I think this is a more prevalent issue than people
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.040]   Really understand
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.960]   It will get more it will get more prevalent as we move forward with AI and
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:25.640]   All kinds of different systems that are you know virtual assistants and things like that like this is only going to
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:33.720]   Either get worse or if we choose to bring all those voices to the table. Maybe it gets better
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   It's just pretty good argument in favor of diversity along the kind of economic lines that this guy was suggesting
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.800]   We need to follow which is that um, you know, if you've compared more diverse teams to less diverse teams
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:55.400]   The more diverse teams are typically more innovative more flexible more creative and they produce better results and the I mean
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.360]   the study study after study has shown that and I you know, I think that
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:06.280]   Uh as companies come around to understanding that we're going to start to see you know
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.640]   I mean not just because it's a good thing or because it's the morally right thing to do which it absolutely is
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.800]   But I think you're going to see a lot of companies like google um and facebook and apple
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.520]   You know increasingly
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.920]   Um striving to increase diversity for the reasons
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.360]   You know, um that you were saying michael partly because it makes your products more
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.720]   Accessible or more interesting or more compatible or better for a wider variety of people
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:37.480]   But also because the teams that you have in house are just going to become more creative and um,
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.400]   I don't know fertile for idea generating and they're going to produce better work
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.280]   But I mean I like if I now
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.400]   Oh, go ahead. Sorry. Oh, I was just saying I agree with that and if I were a company hiring engineers
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.760]   I would not only want those ivy league engineers
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:59.720]   I would also want people who you know, like we look at we look at these innovators who have started companies steve jobs
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.360]   You know, like look at all these people who have had very different
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:11.560]   backgrounds and and ways of learning and so I like I think to count out somebody just because they went to didn't go to an ivy
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:17.640]   league or vice versa is is unfair I like I and also it just like everybody says it limits
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.720]   What you're actually making at the at the end of the day? It's challenging because you're talking about groups
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.800]   In a generalized way, but each employee is an individual
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.640]   And and so you have to hold it in kind of in both ways because you mean you think of the women and hagan hidden figures
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.320]   Who were but not only women but african-americans and nobody thought they could do the math, right?
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:46.520]   Uh because because they're black women. I mean, that's that's as low as you can get from their point of view as a bunch of white male engineers
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:52.360]   But they're individuals and and so but look at the demographics
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.240]   I'm sure google wants to put this whole thing behind it
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:01.080]   Not just because it's good business, but because it's kind of embarrassing if you look this is their most recent diversity kind of
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.320]   Look at their diversity report. Yes
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   This is a
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:12.920]   20% women, but it's even worse if you look at african-americans 1% hispanic people 3%
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.240]   Uh, it's it's not a good. This is current
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.960]   They just started at vp diversity. They couldn't this timing on this was bad for google
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.400]   Well, and also it just shows their failure on both sides, right?
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:31.960]   Like so people like the engineer that wrote that memo are upset because they think there's an active program that is
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.360]   um, essentially removing
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.840]   like-minded individuals, but then
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.840]   on the other side, it's like
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.280]   I know a lot of people that are very upset about these diversity reports because both google and facebook
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.880]   in particular seem to champion themselves as
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.600]   As these like utopian, you know progressive
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.240]   of progressivism. Yeah, yeah
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.120]   Absolutely. Yeah, and it's like when you're hiring when your staff is like 1% black
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.760]   That's not good. I'm both in both cases in both cases for google and facebook
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.720]   It's just I mean, it's just shows that um that talk is cheap
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:16.680]   Essentially and that you know, these companies are not employing this the ideals that they at least you know, tell tell the public
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.720]   So there's my guess that's why he got fired so quickly
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:26.600]   Uh, that this is something. It's just like the vp of diversity. Just said that's it. We got a fire. This guy. This is bad
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.440]   What's what's what's really upsetting to me about this story is that um
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.920]   Pichai was going to hold um, you know meetings to talk with
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:41.800]   Uh with google employees about what had happened and take their questions and you know do the whole town hall thing and they had to cancel those
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:48.200]   Because people were reporting that they were starting to get harassed online and docked and um like that
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.120]   I mean, that's ridiculous. Like it's become gamer. Get this is the gamer gate crowd
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:58.120]   Exactly. Milo yanapolis posted on his facebook page ate google employees who criticized
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.600]   The post and then and then sunda was worried for their safety
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.520]   Yeah, it's crazy. Um, but I mean, it's not just gamer. Get anymore. This is just this is everywhere
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.080]   This is abby. We saw it's in charlotte'sville right now. Yes
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.840]   It's troll troll. It's troll culture. This is what this is
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:21.560]   Do you think what do you think they're more trolls than before or just that they're more they feel empowered or
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.720]   What's going? Um, I think I read it really
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.600]   First and then you can go
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.920]   I um
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.200]   I this is such a weird thing to say. I read this guy's uh stuff his name's film krit hulk
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.040]   and um
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.800]   It's a really smart guy talks about movies a lot and he wrote this article
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.480]   Uh, I can't recall the name of but he talks a lot about
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.720]   um
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.920]   How pop culture has really kind of crafted this
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.600]   generation of um disaffected
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.280]   Young uh, mostly but not all white men
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.840]   um and uh
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.520]   Who who do things for the loles and that uh that things don't matter that nothing matters
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.680]   everything's a big joke. Um, and it's it's a it's a terribly interesting article and um,
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.440]   he
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:20.120]   He kind of breaks down how uh, the rise of you know tv shows like self park, which I think can be
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.000]   extremely powerful and and satirical
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.480]   uh, also kind of encourage that that sort of uh
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.320]   Not giving it
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.800]   Not giving any dams about what happens to anybody like it's sort of this
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:42.200]   self-perpetuating cycle of like, you know, pop culture and then the internet culture sort of like
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.000]   makes it this
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.280]   toxic disease and um, and I I think that at the end of the day I I don't it's weird
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.960]   I I remember when the internet started and I I don't necessarily think it's
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:59.240]   Worse, I just think it's louder and it's it's easier more than ever
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:05.160]   It's easier for anybody to find other like-minded people regardless of what that interest is
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:12.200]   And so um, so that can be used for great good or it can also be used for great, uh, great evil
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.440]   and so um
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.240]   I don't know what the answer that is. I don't I don't think anybody really knows yet, but at the end of the day
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:25.560]   Um, I mean for me like I sign off of all of my stuff on cnad and everywhere else with be good humans
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.120]   And really that's all we can do is just be better
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.480]   Like it's a be more aware and listen to people who are not like us
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:37.800]   Meet them all that stuff. So um, I for me like that article is it's really fascinating
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.560]   And um if I'll I'll look up the name of it, but I have it right here
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:47.400]   It's good. It's a really really great article. Yeah film crit hulk smash distopia and class divide
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.920]   I think that's one of his newer ones. Oh, this was may
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:58.360]   Um, yeah talks about uh the the episode one of the wire and the killing of snot boogie
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.600]   Or is it this one? Yeah, he
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.280]   It's called pc culture versus the big joke. Okay good. All right. That's it. That's the one pc culture versus the big joke
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.440]   And it is it is one of the it's a really good read. It's a long read
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:16.360]   But I highly recommend it. It's just it's really fascinating and if you if you're out there and you're listening to the show and you
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.120]   Don't understand a lot of this like internet culture stuff. I totally get it
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:27.400]   Um, because a lot of people don't spend their time in reddit sub-readits or you know, they don't spend their time doing this stuff or hanging around those people
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.080]   I have to say there of course there is the for the laws were joking. It's all a joke
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:36.760]   But I also get the feeling it's not a joke. It's a joke. Not a joke. You know, sorry. Sorry. Not sorry
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.400]   Sorry, not sorry. And they cover it with
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:46.440]   The joke. I was just kidding. That was the moth the hook. It's cover. Absolutely, but they're dead serious
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.200]   Right
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:53.560]   There's sort of an asymmetry too between like I can get away with joking about this because i'm a white guy
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.160]   um
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:03.000]   But you know the impact on you because that like if i'm joking about like raping you god or some horrible thing like that, right?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.120]   like the
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.080]   Like I can pass that off as a joke sort of among my peer group
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.480]   But the impact on the people that it's targeted at is so horrible. So it's like
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   Right. I don't know that's that's like seems like baked into the the structure of the internet somehow. It's just it's really unfortunate
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.160]   I don't have a good answer.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:29.720]   No, no, and I I agree. I'm gonna actually you can defend gaming, but I think uh, i'm gonna see what you say about this
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:36.280]   I think we grazed the j- okay, and I understand this is uh inflammatory probably as bad as the google memo
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:43.480]   Uh, I think we raised a generation of people who lived in their basements that did not communicate with other people spent all the time on the screen
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.880]   I think it's getting worse with smartphones by the way
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   And that this generation of people never had to relate to other people in any way except gaming and as a result
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.480]   There's somewhat damaged. They're a social
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   I I would disagree with that. Um, I think that
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.440]   What has happened and and I
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:10.040]   This is what I feel maybe is my kind of hypothesis on this is that um
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.160]   boomers and yuppies
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.760]   raised two generations of kids gen xers and millennials and gen xers are
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.240]   Raising younger millennials now. Um, or I guess what are they gen z now?
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:30.760]   Uh, but the I just say let's just say millennials because that's the one, you know, we're killing everybody with our avocado toast or whatever
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.800]   so, uh, we'll focus on that but but like
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.320]   My parents did not
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.800]   regulate or otherwise
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:46.760]   Pay attention to what I was looking at on the internet when I when it when I first got the internet like I I remember it very clearly
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.960]   Because they had no idea what it was and neither did I
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:57.480]   And so it just was like oh, it's it's like a phone call but for everywhere or with for everything like and and I think that
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.640]   for a long time
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   when we first
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.640]   Opened up the internet. Um
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.360]   There there were a lot of really big gaps in oversight
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.640]   and um by parents specifically
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.360]   And maybe even teachers
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:20.920]   Uh, but at the end of the day like you have this time period where a lot of people who are now
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.200]   Let's say 25 to 35
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.720]   Um are have had very little
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.840]   Uh oversight on what they see online or what they saw online when they were younger
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:41.080]   And they know, you know how to find like-minded people they know how to organize really well. They know how to brigade people
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:49.560]   Um, it's it really is like to me. I think and I I hope that because millennials have so much experience
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.680]   Always being connected like we are literally the the earliest part of millennials is like
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:32:02.920]   Early mid 80s. That's the last generation of people who will ever remember not being connected. Yeah, and I think that
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.640]   Well, it's kind of have some effect. I mean it's kind of have some effect to raise a kid
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:14.360]   Like if I ever decide to have a kid, I am so much more aware of what is out there
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.400]   That I feel I would be more vigilant now
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:23.320]   Uh more so than maybe my parents were when I started using the internet. Yeah, so I
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:29.400]   Feel like that might help. I mean, you you have to at least you know, uh, you know, AOL is much different than
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.840]   That's true. I assume that you're on AOL. That's like that's much
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:39.960]   Prodigy. I was very special. I'm proud. Oh, wow. Okay, so I'm mad. That's why you turned that okay
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.920]   Deep cuts gotta get that prodigy pen pal
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.960]   Yeah, yeah, no, I mean prodigy was was big
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.520]   Um, but yeah, I think like things have changed a lot since prodigy and AOL versus
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.320]   Uh, you know where we're at with google and twitter and snapchat and
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.640]   A lot of these new forms of communication. I think you you used one word that I completely agree with which is louder
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.640]   I think that
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.440]   These social media companies have in many people's minds are still startups
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:12.040]   I think people think of them as being run by kids who are wearing hoodies who are
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:18.200]   Um, you know biking to work and hanging out in san francisco somewhere and that's just not the case
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.280]   You know, these are these people have for influence than maybe any other american corporation and
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:31.320]   Any other segment of american corporations and so, um, you know, I think that's been the transition that i've seen and that
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:36.600]   i'm really trying to drill into, um, you know with with the work that I do which is that
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:44.200]   Now more than ever these companies have a huge amount of influence more that we more than we even understand and um,
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:52.360]   And one way that we're starting to see this sort of bubble up is by giving a voice to people that are ill informed and uneducated and
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.760]   Sometimes hateful and um, and um, and you know it wouldn't surprise me and you know the other
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.640]   portion of this is that um being anonymous online has become more
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:10.360]   More what more poisonous more more you can be more effective and just and spread more hate through the world by being anonymous
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.760]   Now than you could in the 90s with a low on prodigy and so, um, you know
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.600]   My guess is that the people that are making horrific comments like, you know, you
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.880]   The like some of the things that you mentioned earlier
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:27.400]   We're probably done under anonymous handles on twitter or under anonymous
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   Screen names on reddit and uh and anonymity online
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.560]   um, although I was
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:40.440]   I long championed that I'm starting to question the value too. We thought it was going to be a great thing and now i'm wondering if we have
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:48.040]   Maybe gone it's hard because there are so many places in the world that require it. Yeah, you know, it's dangerous for people to be online
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.520]   It's dangerous right if there's good reason for it, but then
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.080]   Others use it. It's so hard others use it for bad things and it's with
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.240]   It's I could not to pull from spiderman
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.640]   But it's you know with great power comes great responsibility and the internet is probably the most powerful thing
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.040]   We've ever invented as as humans rolling in our chat room says something interesting
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.600]   Uh, and I think agrees with you Ashley says I have the cause and effect backwards
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:16.200]   I was saying too much time in the basement leads to a social people he says there are always there have always been forgotten people
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.480]   But now the forgotten people have tools to vent rage
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.760]   Without personal consequences. I think that's what both you
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:29.800]   Ashley are saying and Michael is that we have these two and find other a social people right to gather and you know
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.360]   Yeah
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.240]   Would have happened here. It's an echo chamber of hearing like
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.040]   Confirmation that those ill-informed beliefs are true and valid right?
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.920]   And that feels good for everybody everybody wants to hear they're right, you know and it's like I
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.680]   Twitter and Facebook and Google have a responsibility or are they just common carriers? So they just
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:59.000]   Delivering the message of course they have a responsibility. There's no I don't think there's a there's a there's no neutral ground in this
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.360]   I mean every interface decision they make everything
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.600]   They decide to do in terms of sharing, you know what your friends like
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:13.000]   or um showing you search results or pushing certain kinds of ads to you based on what you've done those are
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.520]   Like I don't think you can you can say those are like morally neutral just common carrier decisions
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.680]   Unless you're someone with no life experience, right?
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.400]   Oh, you mean like the guy wrote that?
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:31.320]   But Michael has it right where it's like these people who run who run these companies
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.240]   have
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:39.160]   Tremendous amounts of influence over what we see in our everyday lives maybe even more so than
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.760]   Our parents or our friends or our family
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:51.000]   And you know I I might spend more time on the internet than I do seeing actual real life people like during my week and so
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.360]   That's a lot of responsibility. You know like my one of my friends recently
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.000]   Uh
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.480]   Announce that she was pregnant and you know what I told her was that we were talking about google's influence
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.400]   She has a google home in her living room
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.760]   And what I said was that google probably knew that she was pregnant before even her husband
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.400]   And and we were talking about the responsibility of like knowing that type of information, you know
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:22.440]   These companies use deductive reasoning based on your behavior and search results and a variety of other things to to figure out
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.760]   What your general disposition is um the information that you're looking for, you know
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.920]   Sometimes it can be very helpful and and obviously these companies try to do that
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.120]   But um other times it can be emotionally manipulative
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.840]   So, you know, amazon is trying to sell more products
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:43.880]   Day after day more and more products year over year, right? And and facebook is trying to get you to spend more time on their network
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.600]   Day after day and year over year
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.840]   And the way that they do that is by toying with your emotions using little red dot
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.960]   um little red dots to show you that you have a notification or
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.280]   um, maybe promoting your
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:02.680]   You know some girl that you have a crush on in your newsfeed and there are so many decisions like this that are happening behind closed doors
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.040]   It's so true. It's so true. Cashmere Hill wrote this story five years ago for Forbes
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.280]   How target figured out a team
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.320]   Yeah before father did it's because of where she went in the store and what she was doing
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.240]   Uh, so this is not new in fact. I remember this from years ago
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   Just from your zip code people could tell what magazines you might subscribe to or were likely to what kind of cars
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.320]   Yeah, you're likely to buy it, but it's just gotten so refined
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.680]   And so good now. I want to take a break, but we can get data
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.600]   Let's I mean who has more data than anyone about you
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.400]   I'm I'm gonna you could say google and maybe it's google
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.320]   But I think mark Zuckerberg might have more data than anybody else about you
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.920]   And I also worry about what he might be doing with that data. We're gonna take a little break
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.480]   When we come back and talk about mark's latest hire, but first
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.280]   word for word press
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.960]   WordPress runs 28 percent of all the websites in the world including my
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.320]   Blog including courts including some of the best publications in the world
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.040]   They run websites for many major companies is because the WordPress platform is
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:14.120]   Powerful robust and easy to use if it's good enough for these big businesses is great enough for your small business
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.240]   You don't need to be a web expert to create a site at wordpress.com
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:22.200]   You can make it easier for your customers to find you to connect with you. It's really important frankly
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.760]   If you're a bit used to be if you're a business
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.120]   And you didn't have a yellow page is that well, how was anybody gonna find you?
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.920]   Then it was if you don't have an answering machine how people are gonna leave you message
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.320]   Now I think if a business doesn't have a website
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.160]   I'm even if it's a plumber
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.480]   I'm much less likely to use them because I can't find out more stuff about them
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.880]   You've got to have a website
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:47.880]   And I know you you know if if you are a plumber or or you know a schoolteacher a handyman or a restaurant
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.480]   That's not your
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.080]   Designing web pages ain't your business and you don't want to make it your business
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.880]   But you got to have that website wordpress.com start with amazing templates
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:04.040]   Experts who can guide you through the entire process. They have the best support and wordpress.com is a community
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.160]   I've run self-hosted WordPress since the early 2000s, but when I move my site to wordpress.com suddenly
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.120]   I'm part of a larger community people follow me
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:19.160]   It's there's a front page they can promote your your stories on there and and I have half a million followers now on WordPress
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:24.840]   And that blew me away that happens so quickly you'll boost your visibility too because of course search engine optimization
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.560]   That's built in and these guys have been doing a long time
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.280]   They know exactly what buttons and knobs to put push
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:36.520]   Social sharing makes it very easy for your readers to spread the word about your site everywhere else
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:42.440]   Lots of WordPress if you have a business site I I turn on the amp plug-in. I highly recommend that that way
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.520]   Your pages load faster on mobile thanks to google amp technology
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:54.040]   I turn on a number of really great plugins that make my site better automatically HTTPS automatically very easy
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:59.720]   And I want you to go there right now because we've got a special deal at wordpress.com/twit
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:05.720]   You get 15% off any new plan purchase. I registered when my daughter was born 25 years ago
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.200]   I registered her name dot com and I registered it for 20 years
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   I figured if she doesn't use it by then I just renewed it
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.080]   She doesn't use it by then I could probably let it go but I kept it and now 25 years later
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:23.160]   She says I need that website. I said go to wordpress.com start it. We'll we'll hook it up
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.560]   It's very easy to connect it to the domain name and then you'll be
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.880]   abbyloport.com
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:35.160]   WordPress.com/twit say 15% on your brand new site right now
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.720]   So mark Zuckerberg
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:44.200]   I don't know we've talked about this before I feel like he's gonna run for president and given the power
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.920]   That he has with the facebook platform
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.160]   I think he could just win just by you know pushing a couple of knobs
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.120]   Slightly skewing the newsfeed and it's over
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:58.360]   He just hired now he says over and around not running
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.200]   Except that he's doing a 50 state tour to meet people in every state
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.640]   He's announced that maybe I am a christian after all I I'm not an atheist anymore. Anyway that much
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.280]   I know for sure and he is now hired
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.920]   a
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.600]   pollster
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:21.000]   Joel Benenson who was chief advisor to barack obama chief strategist of hillary clinton's failed
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.480]   campaign now that may not be the best resume builder but
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.280]   Uh, and he is in his bio
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:33.560]   It says he's the only democratic pollster in history to have played a leading role in three winning presidential campaigns mark zuckerberg has hired him
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.360]   Oh, yeah to work for the charity
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.600]   Come on
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.600]   do you guys a
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.680]   Is mark zuckerberg gonna run for president 2020 and be
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.320]   Who could stop him?
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:52.520]   Look at that tie the dude is wearing that's a president tie. That is a presidential tie
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.680]   That's a cornflower blue presidential tie that's his speech at harvard
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.040]   That's a quite a lovely tie actually. I'm press that's from him at harvard getting his honorary degree
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   It was quite a good self-effacing
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.680]   Speech talks about making a better world
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:12.520]   The thing is I think you can make the argument that
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.160]   uh trump won
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:24.280]   Do in large part to his very effective use not have to they didn't buy tv ads of facebook right right and what happens here's the real question
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.200]   what happens when
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:32.920]   Mark zuckerberg divests himself of facebook which I mean at this point probably doesn't even have to he doesn't this is
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.600]   Another data point when they when they created the charity the mark in prozilla chan sort of charity
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.080]   They changed the bylaws of facebook
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:48.680]   To literally say and should mark zuckerberg take a government job. He can still run facebook
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.280]   And as we all know
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   Government ethics no longer applies so nobody's gonna make him divests from the other side either
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.520]   Yeah, that's what i'm saying. They're not gonna make him divest and he could he could run facebook
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:08.280]   What happens if even just a small group of engineers who support him for president decide
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:13.640]   Again with the whole you know very small percentage of people making decisions that affect
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:19.240]   millions or billions of people facebook has two billion users not obviously here in the us but
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:25.640]   Millions of users to say well, we're only gonna show positive stories about uh about mark zuckerberg
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:31.240]   All hands meaning mr. Mark says now i'm not gonna tell you guys to do that
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.520]   But I just want you to know it'd be okay with me
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.280]   I mean there already made that decision because that was part of the reporting that we did while I was
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   Formerly like his moto, which was that they they wouldn't allow stories about
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:51.320]   Facebook to trend within the trending news column on the site and similarly they were very strict about
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:58.040]   What stories they allowed to trend? Um concerning mark zuckerberg so they're definitely controlling the pr around his name
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.040]   I just think that
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.240]   You know
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.120]   People are sort of jumping to conclusions with a lot of this
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.760]   A lot of the decisions made around mark zuckerberg. I think he has to treat himself
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:14.920]   Similarly to a politician because facebook is all about trust right the second you stop trusting the network
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.720]   You stop posting to it and you stop interacting with all of their different web properties
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:24.200]   And so I think part of the reason why he's hired so many
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.320]   um
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.560]   Political experts is because he is trying to sort of rebrand himself
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.480]   after you know there was a long time when people hated mark zuckerberg and
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.440]   Because there was a social network because of the social network, right? Exactly. Yeah, so you know
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:45.320]   We've we've sort of enough time has passed that um that a lot of people have forgotten about that movie
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:52.280]   I think but um, but he still faces an uphill battle in terms of uh in terms of you know getting people to
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:58.840]   um to see him as someone that they'd want to have a drink with at the bar and ultimately that's kind of what he
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.800]   He champions facebook as it's like it's all about communities and sharing ideas
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:10.360]   And and it's essentially this like virtual bar that you can go to and hang out with uh to hang out with people and and talk about
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.280]   You know different ideas, but um, he's got i gotta say he's got dead eyes
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:21.880]   He's it's the face. It's the face of a happy smiling person, but the it's behind there
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:26.120]   That's the there's an air's a robot in there in my opinion
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.680]   I can't sign up for my tiny letter
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:34.120]   And many people said always not gonna run for president. Why would he want to he's runs?
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:41.320]   Facebook is bigger than the us he runs facebook. I think here's mark my words. He will run for president
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:49.800]   A nation will be desperate will be thirsty for somebody a technocrat who seems intelligent who seems like he can solve
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:56.360]   Interactable problems that we're facing and he said I have a solution look. I don't need the money
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:01.800]   I'm not in it for the money. I just want to make the world a better place. That's all i've ever wanted to do
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:08.120]   And uh, and he's not gonna be blatant on facebook. It's gonna be very subtle. You won't even know
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.680]   But it will absolutely
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.200]   Gently push people and he's gonna win
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.160]   Well, I mean
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.160]   President
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.720]   We
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:35.960]   Series space I'm just gonna say I don't want to offend anybody, but I think we've had our rock moment in 2016
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.800]   I think the pendulum now has to swing. I don't know
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.880]   Have some furious knives coming
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.600]   You don't know I think it's kind of governor of california
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.720]   Well, it would it would make sense for him to work his way up, right?
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:55.160]   But well, no, no, I think that I just I don't think he can like trump is learning right now that you know
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:02.680]   It's not really command and control position. Right being president is kind of like being asked to wrangle a ranch full of cats
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:09.000]   You know, it's like it's not fun. Um, I think he'd be more interested in a job where he could actually get something done
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:16.520]   Under estimate his ambition. I think I don't think mark sicvers is kind of guy who looks at the presidency and sees how it's being run today and says
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.880]   Oh, yeah, I don't want that job. I couldn't do that. He's the kind of guy
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:26.680]   Wrongly or rightly probably wrong way who says no, no, no, I can take I can take this challenge on and I can remake his country
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:31.640]   What is that in the social network where he's like, you know, what's cooler than a million dollars a billion dollars?
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.600]   He's like, you know what's cooler than being the head of facebook being the president of the freaking us
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:44.440]   And I think I don't think that there's if I am not worried about trump and an authoritarian becoming authoritarian a demagogue
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.520]   I am much more worried about mark succorberg in a very benign
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:55.160]   Smiling we're going to bring everybody together way. I don't I don't think that this ends at the united states
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.160]   I think he wants to run the world
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:01.400]   Now is that crazy? That's crazy now. I'm scared. Yeah
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.600]   Because he says
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.160]   Arguing a lot. Yeah, see they've been fighting all the time. It's not gonna turn into a total
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.360]   Look elan knows that mark is that's why elan dissed him
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.160]   He totally knows. Oh my god. He knows
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.400]   You know, well, and I think you know, we have we now have a blueprint for
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:26.040]   Someone transitioning from the business world into the political world and so it's you know what you're saying leo is not hard to imagine
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:30.840]   It's kind of terrifying to think about I'd like to assume that he still has
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.520]   You know the the bintress. I'm sorry the business interest
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.280]   Prioritized, you know first in his mind, but um
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.600]   Yeah, you're you know, it's really easy to imagine what you're talking about
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:50.040]   And by the way add, uh, you know machine learning and you did you see this uh this study?
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   Um that this isn't it actually but instagram has now able to they they did some work and they're able to figure out
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:02.440]   If you're depressed from your instagram photos there it is
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:09.080]   Uh, yeah, okay. I'm just saying instagram is owned by who remind me again
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.320]   Facebook
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.320]   Facebook face face somebody
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.680]   Uh
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.400]   Now so what they did it's actually kind of interesting
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.640]   They took 139 people and they took all of their pictures
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.160]   I think 43,000 some huge number of pictures and then they also asked them
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.200]   I'll how do you feel how do you feel how do you feel and they were able to build a model
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:33.080]   Which now does a better job than a trained psychotherapist?
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   at assessing
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.640]   the emotional tenor of the of a person from their pictures
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:45.320]   Is it just the pictures or like they using the hashtag depressed
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.240]   Well, it's kind of and it's weird stuff too like um
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:54.600]   It's like, uh, it's uh, it's if they do a lot of muted colors
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.640]   Yeah, yeah, like I think boy on the film fairs they choose that would be a yeah
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.360]   And there are less faces. I believe was another um key point from that study
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:08.680]   You know the thing is that facebook is actively and has published um
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.320]   Research on this type of stuff
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.760]   Um, so, you know, this is this happens to be an independent
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.800]   um
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.280]   An independent organization I believe but like but facebook is actively researching this stuff
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.320]   Um, and they have published publicly, you know information about how they can determine your general
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:32.200]   Disposition so like whether you're sad whether you're happy and then also how they can influence it so by you know promoting more
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.960]   Um depressing stories in your newsfeed they can actually affect your general disposition and
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.120]   This is something they openly admitted around like 2012. I believe so
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:48.600]   Um, we can only guess, you know where they're at now. I think that's what what terrifies me is that there's no
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.800]   um
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:55.720]   There's no regulation in place for them to have to disclose any of the the studies that they're doing
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:00.040]   on the psychology of their users and on like the the emotions of their users and
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:07.000]   This instagram studies reminds us of the fact that a lot can be determined by your behavior online
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.600]   And um by the things that you decide to post by the keywords that you decide to use in tweets
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:14.120]   um
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:14.840]   and
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:22.760]   Sentiment analysis they call it and they've been they're getting better and better at this and this is a perfect example of machine learning applied against a giant data set
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:28.120]   Uh, they do it for pictures. You can search google for dogs. You know search your google photos for dogs
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   It's a very good. Well
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.600]   Interestingly, uh face instagram users
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.000]   Uh who were depressed tended to choose the inkwell filter
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.920]   And happy ones tended to choose valencia. So just think about it next time you choose a filter
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.640]   Honest
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.640]   I love it well
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.840]   No, we're depressed
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.560]   We didn't even say somebody we didn't even know it
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.640]   Uh
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:00.520]   I you know and I think I think we have you have a good article on mashable
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.200]   Is is I think was is google eating the world or is it facebook eating the world
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.760]   Google google eating the world eating the open internet, but I call it the world because
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.360]   What else is there? That's the world we live in. Yeah, it's the world we live up
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   I think we are completely
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:22.200]   Underestimating what all of this date what all of this data that we're giving facebook and google will be used for for instance
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:27.400]   Somebody asked me today on the radio show. What's app wants my contact list? I don't want to give it to them
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:32.360]   And I said well what they say they're gonna do with that is uh, you know store it on their server
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:38.680]   And if somebody you know in your contact list joins what's app they'll send you a message saying hey your buddies on what's app you want to connect with them
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:44.600]   But what I think they're really doing is imagine if you had a billion people's
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:48.280]   Contact list and then you crossed referenced it
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:56.200]   You would know all all the relationships anybody has you would know who they talk to a lot who they talk to a little
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.520]   You would know who they work with
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.320]   Uh, there we had rob read on last week his new book
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:09.000]   Uh, it's just fantastic. It's called the after on and in it. I don't think it's a spoiler because this happens very early on
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.400]   There's a app called flutter
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:16.120]   Uh that is based on machine learning and uh three of the pro
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:21.000]   Protagonist go into a bar and flutter pops up a coupon offer
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:28.680]   But it's more than that because they know because of when they arrived at the bar that and that they're co workers that they must be having a work meeting
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:33.000]   And this is minor right obviously they could figure all that stuff out
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.960]   Flutter actually becomes sentient, but that's that's another
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:42.040]   Matter entirely, but I'm not worried. I am actually not worried about you know
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:45.880]   Skynet and sentience. I'm much more worried about
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:51.960]   What will really happen and it by the way will happen? Uh, I think quickly it will be
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.160]   Uh, like a catalytic reaction. It will be
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:02.040]   hockey stick like where all of a sudden the critical massive data will be reached may have already happened. We just don't know it
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.800]   and
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.640]   Facebook will know everything
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.920]   And we'll have so much data about you. They will know more about you than you do
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.520]   Right
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.520]   Yeah, I think that's true. I think you know it goes even to the level of
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.360]   DNA research right facebook, uh, I'm sorry google
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.800]   um
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.600]   I believe on 23 and me or maybe it's a former googler
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.560]   But either way there are companies that are already set up to
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.360]   analyze your dna and
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.080]   I think people aren't even questioning I gave them they're a sponsor
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.080]   I gave them a spit
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:42.760]   And listen like they're doing a lot of really cool and interesting things. However, you have to ask yourself
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.400]   Do you trust a private company with your?
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:52.680]   genetic code it was founded by uh, am wojiski and of course the wojiski susan wojiski runs youtube and their mother
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.840]   rented the garage
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:00.760]   To larry and sir game when they started google so so there is definitely a google connection to 23 and me
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:04.440]   There's no evidence that they're handing information over to google but yeah, absolutely not yet
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:10.040]   And are you just saying earlier michael about 20 people making all the decisions that affect the billions of us?
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.920]   I think we might have stumbled on the corner of that nexus there
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.760]   Yeah
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:19.480]   To go back earlier. It also is why it's so important that there be some diversity in this group because
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:22.200]   uh, they have they know everything
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.560]   uh
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.560]   It should you know
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:29.000]   This these are what to do with that data. That's what you do. It's what to do
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.480]   It's what we do with it and and the more
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.560]   diversity we have in voices whether that is
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:45.240]   A poor white guy or a rich white woman or a rich indian man or whatever it doesn't matter class race
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:50.760]   life experiences life choices the more diversity we have
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:57.160]   Making those decisions is going to make uh, what we do with that data better
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.960]   Maybe instead of a question. I do you do you guys do anything?
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:07.240]   Uh like to to prevent google or facebook from knowing too much about you
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.560]   Because i'm always like i'm screwing around i'm putting in fake information
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:17.160]   I'll go months without using facebook and i'll use twitter instead and then i'll switch back i use a different uh
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.520]   I use juk-duk go now instead of google perseptus
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.040]   That fools them
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:27.080]   No, I mean i i'm just kind of like doing what i can to kind of monkey wrench it a little bit here and there but
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:31.320]   Right don't fuzz it. I say I want to okay. I'll be the experiment. I'll be the guinea pig
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:36.280]   I'm giving them everything i'm 23 and me everything that i'm hiding nothing not using any privacy filters
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:40.600]   Uh, what you don't know leo is there's an entire island of use
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.160]   Somewhere in the world. Oh, I know that
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.360]   Uh, 23 and me is cloned 50 leo report
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:53.160]   And they're conducting all kinds of cycle terrible psychological experiments cheer me up though
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:57.880]   You guys are younger than me. I'm gold. I'm thinking maybe this is a symptom of getting older
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:03.320]   I feel like we're heading into this stopia that this is this is oh, we're there. I think we're there
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:06.520]   Yeah, you're supposed to cheer me up
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:14.200]   Well, I mean, I think you know, I think that the problem is that there's no proficiency in technology in washington right now
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:20.040]   And so you have companies that are essentially operating as monopolies or building to monopoly
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.520]   The goo right now you're going hey full speed ahead. We got four years. Let's go
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:27.800]   Why do you think the stock market's going up?
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:33.480]   This is good for business. Who's driving that growth? It's technology companies primarily and so
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:39.320]   Um, yeah, so I think that you know, we're living in a time where you know, it's similar to the 1920s
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.880]   It's these are essentially the robber barons of our time
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:47.080]   They are building businesses that have disrupted entire industries. I mean amazon by purchasing whole foods
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.800]   Has suddenly you know is suddenly threatening the entire grocery
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:59:00.600]   Industry, you know, that's that's wild and and and any of these companies can do that by acquiring a certain business or by deciding that
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:04.280]   They're going to put resources into a given area. They can completely upend
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:12.680]   Industries that have existed for um for decades and so you see it with tesla amazon, you know, facebook is sort of a new like
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:20.840]   Social media is sort of a new thing but um, but certainly they have the resources to just drill in on any industry and upend it and even apple
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:28.600]   You know, um with watches, right? You know that that's something that for a long time people thought couldn't be upended couldn't be disrupted and
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:35.480]   And tech companies have the power to essentially flip switch and decide that
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:40.120]   Um that they're going to take over an industry and that's just the the time that we live in
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.560]   I think that in every
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.120]   major
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.480]   section of
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:52.520]   Our history where we've had a a series of technological innovation
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:59.160]   Um like the industrial evolution. I think of those people probably also felt they were living in a dystopia
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.240]   um
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.920]   And didn't know there's a lot of uncertainty. I think that that's very true
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.160]   um, but I
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.400]   I don't know. I mean there's always a part of me that just believes in the inherent goodness of most people
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:19.320]   Um even the people who have all the power a lot of them are decent people who make mistakes sure but
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:25.080]   Um, I don't know. I I think i'll still hold on to my star fleet star trek
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.820]   future someday and what that's there's not always a bit of a
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.440]   begin
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.040]   yet
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.040]   yet that it's not a team that your
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.900]   necessarily pessimistic right like I love technology of needed a career on we
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.720]   hate the weekend and learn more about it and that will never change time and
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.080]   optimists at heart
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.680]   however i have i have access to
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.040]   things that a lot of people don't and uh...
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.660]   and i i think it would be wrong for me not to
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.320]   try to relay some of that information to
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.040]   uh... that essentially that's my job as a journalist right it's to talk to people
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.680]   that are working at these companies
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.360]   and figure out what's going on the inside and then hopefully relab
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.680]   relay that information to to the public
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.800]   and i think the one thing that they seem to be a big disconnect between
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.280]   on people using the services and downloading apps and looking at this
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.560]   you know what this has been called the black box
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.340]   uh... that that runs a lot of these uh...
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.120]   a lot of these apps
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.240]   and what's going on behind the scenes how algorithms work how you know
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.280]   the logic that's used to uh... to sort this information out you know
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.320]   that there is a proficiency problem in america right now and
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.080]   when people hear the word algorithm i think they just like they don't understand
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.160]   what that means and they get intimidated by it in a lot of cases
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.400]   over
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.140]   definitely and and i don't blame them because it used to happen for me until i
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.020]   started learning about some of the algorithms that sort through these
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:53.880]   things so
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.520]   like the algorithm the suggestion algorithm in amazon or the
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.500]   trending news algorithm at facebook you know these are actually very rudimentary
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:07.300]   uh... algorithm problems there it's it's you know it's elementary logic you
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.160]   know that they're not quite as complicated as you might think
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.600]   and uh...
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.360]   and i think that most people don't understand that
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.320]   and also we don't have access to
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.560]   to the to
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:23.860]   what that line of logic is and i think that to me is more troubling than anything
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.340]   we did we have no idea how
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:29.920]   facebook for example decides to sort our newsfeed i think
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.440]   in the long-term like in my lifetime that's gonna be a problem and and i'd
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.020]   probably now
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.100]   it's a problem right now it's why facebook is powerful because they use
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.900]   algorithms to to shade the feed
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.540]   and we don't know
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:47.420]   what their uh... i mean we could presume they're optimizing for stickiness
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:51.440]   but maybe not because remember uh... they they deprecated link bait which was
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.220]   probably very much
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.060]   they can choose at any time to change that's
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.440]   and i think that's the thing that they do
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:03.040]   right and they do and but and they are not transparently completely
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.860]   for my money to get this i think we have a lot more ability to affect the
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.640]   direction of technology then
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.200]   then we think we do
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.080]   uh... and i'm i'm really grateful for people who are trying to explain and
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.120]   bring to light and share with the rest of us what's going on inside these
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.400]   companies
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.920]   because i think um...
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.320]   in some cases it turns out that
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.440]   you know if consumers care enough of the users of these products care enough
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.680]   even though there may be two billion
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.120]   users of facebook
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.760]   they can still make a difference i mean look at the
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.880]   the delete uber campaign right like i i'm not gonna say that that
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.120]   that fixed ubers problems overnight but it definitely had made the company
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.680]   take seriously its issues in a way that on any amount of negative press coverage
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.360]   or
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.440]   or a government action had had failed to do
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.120]   so i i think they're you know if people care enough
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.440]   and they're aware enough about
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.160]   how facebook and google are an amazon are affecting our world i think that
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.720]   we have a lot more power than
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.000]   and uh... we give ourselves credit for
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.640]   i hope you're right i agree that's true i agree
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.160]   oh good
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.640]   just remember just remember what little fingers says
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.680]   chaos is not a pit
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.560]   chaos
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560]   is a ladder
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.360]   so true so true
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.520]   i don't know if it's true
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.000]   but maybe that gives us hope
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.720]   they were just climbing the ladder
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.800]   i mean i'm gonna be a robot in fifty years so it's fine
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.120]   that you're playing cuz i was my plan i just want to put my brain in a jar
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.360]   or something i know that's a hundred percent my plan is to be a robot and
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.680]   you're young enough you could achieve it actually
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.760]   shoot myself into space and just
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.040]   all around and see what happens i'm like a guy who's running down the train
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.640]   track the trains pulling out of the station and just hoping i can catch it
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.720]   before i die
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.360]   there's a whole i don't know what you mean because twenty three and me has
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.440]   taken your d_n_a_ and trappist one is a colony of leo labor
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.960]   uh... hope so
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.280]   you guys i'm going in the opposite direction in like twenty years i am
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.920]   going to be unplugged and sitting under a redwood tree way up in the mountains
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.160]   so more likely my end is well-dilling
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.560]   i don't know though i hate it
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.760]   account don't you want to know how it's going to alter now
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.440]   at some point i'm gonna be like screw it
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.240]   i think i feel like bison tenio man at some point you'll be like a robot that
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.160]   chooses to be a human because you want to
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.880]   go back to humanity
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.960]   will be like that
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.240]   fascinating stuff actually is get the is here she's from

[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:50.600]   to
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.560]   dealing dot
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.560]   twenty dot com
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.920]   that's it
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.960]   our show today brought to you by the tracker now they sometimes tech does
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.880]   make your life better if you've ever lost stuff
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.240]   you know or if you've ever spent the morning late for work trying to find
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.560]   your car keys you know
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.880]   that there must be a better way like why can't why do i keep losing my phone my
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:20.000]   car keys and you know if you if you've used find my iphone you know you realize
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.640]   there is a better way
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.760]   and that's kind of what the tracker is it's like fine my iphone for all of your
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.320]   other stuff
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.720]   so what you do is you take the tracker it's a bit of the two little ones now
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.760]   there's a the tracker bravo is about the size of a quarter but lighter it's
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.000]   anodized aluminum
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.600]   and they have the new tracker pixel which has even smaller and lighter i think
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.360]   it's the smallest bluetooth tracker
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:44.400]   and it it lights up with pics with the l_e_d_s around that so you can help you
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.320]   find stuff not just with audio
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.920]   signals but with lights
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.600]   you put on your keys that's the first place i put it my back pack and then i
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.840]   put it my luggage you put on the remote control
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.000]   you put it on the dog they have a little it's small enough to put in a collar
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.520]   and they have a little waterproof
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.160]   uh... holder for it to protect it
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.680]   and now once you've heard it your phone you could see where your stuff is where
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.080]   your trackers are or whatever the trackers attached to on your phone you get a
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:09.840]   map
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.280]   but here's the other cool thing
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.240]   if somebody takes your let's say let's say you put on your keys
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.320]   now you know when you leave the room your phone will say hey you left your
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.960]   keys and by the way the other way around to when you leave your phone
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.600]   lying around your keys start going we believe we
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.120]   you can also if you say all i know i left my phone somewhere around here
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.960]   press a button on the tracker they'll make the phone even if it's silence make
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.160]   the phone make noise that's very handy i really like that
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.680]   but also there's this issue because once you get out of bluetooth range out of
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.600]   a hundred hundred feet
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.640]   you all the trackers software says the last time i saw this but here's the
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.320]   beauty part there are four and a half million actually it's got to be more
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:44.920]   now
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.280]   probably might more like five million trackers
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.080]   out there all over the world
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.960]   and in anytime anybody running the tracker software
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.480]   sees your keys with the tracker on it
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.840]   it'll ping your phone and now you'll map will be updated to the last time
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.760]   anybody saw your keys so no matter where they are
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.840]   all look at this map all over the world
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.720]   you can find your stuff
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.320]   the lightest bluetooth tracking device on the market that's the tracker pixel
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.720]   both the tracker pixel and tracker bravo have replaceable batteries unlike
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.480]   some of these other guys you don't have to throw it out once you could just put
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.760]   the battery in every year
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.840]   bluetooth l_e_ goes about a year

[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.560]   or a little velcro dogs and uh... and they can be
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.080]   annoying but like they're also really goofy and funny and
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.880]   and i was a personality so i look for a dog that just wants to sleep
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.360]   that's what i'm looking for
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:31.880]   thank you
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.440]   okay we've done the depressing stuff
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.480]   yet there's a lot of it this week too much of it so much
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.440]   and you were headed out of it i have never been so depressed in my life i
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.360]   it's
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.720]   and i don't i don't think it's i don't think it's
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.040]   me i think it's situational
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.080]   i just feel like what what happened with it we're gonna
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.560]   in fact i'm starting to not care because i think kim jong
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.120]   un's gonna set us off a nuclear war in advance matter
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.640]   have you tried to get some sort of exactly
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.920]   maybe i should stop using inkwell i think that's a problem
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.680]   i'm not using the lens yet from now on
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.360]   it's a national only
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.160]   it's funny because isn't that the saying that if somebody is an optimist they
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.760]   look through the world with rose colored glasses look at the world through
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.200]   rose colored glasses
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.720]   now you can say they look at it through national through national
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.200]   i'm a f_a_ fan myself that's kind of in between yeah that's nice
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.840]   it's warm
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.600]   but it's a little muted
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.040]   it's kind of a share my personality
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.000]   actually there's an algorithm this is from uh... the m_i_t_ technology review
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.160]   there's an algorithm
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.760]   uh... that's been trained on emoji
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.080]   that knows when you're being sarcastic on twitter
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.040]   this is one of the toughest computer problems how to
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.680]   how do computers understand sarcasm
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.840]   can i be honest for a second like
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.040]   how hard was it for this algorithm to figure out people are being sarcastic on
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.120]   twitter
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:04.120]   like
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.040]   that the study seems suspect to me
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:12.800]   is it about the study to me is there's not there's no emoji for sarcasm
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.720]   like what what emoji do you think it's an i-roll
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.200]   yeah
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.200]   you see i wrote what's an i-roll emoji
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.200]   the one that's like you know it's just a face of all of the eyes
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.240]   oh yeah and then uh... i also use the one with the upside down smiley face
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.160]   that's a good start
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.320]   i think even just standard smiley can work you know you it there's a lot
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.040]   does a lot of nuance here because you can get it depends on how you are
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:43.120]   what about that one was just not a smile like it's not a lot of it doesn't
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.720]   you know it doesn't mean anything it's like
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.160]   expressionless
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.880]   yeah yeah
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.800]   so according or the one without a mouth that's another good
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.040]   credit is article again m_i_t_ right
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.200]   the
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.680]   uh... robot was was better at identifying sarcasm on twitter then humans humans
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.120]   average score seventy six percent robots eighty two percent
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:13.120]   and now there's a you there's a deep moji website they call it deep moji
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.600]   that

[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.360]   chaos
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.400]   is a ladder that'd be a good one let's see if it thinks that's sarcastic
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.320]   or what so we're gonna submit it they can help us figure out what is gonna
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.560]   happen in the thrones
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.640]   uh...
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.200]   high confidence

[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.800]   and i have a man that one they gave me a so i think it is it like this
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.600]   like i'm trying to recreate this and i'm
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.600]   it's like this
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.320]   it's okay
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:22.560]   everybody made this just like that's all do it let's all do it and see what we

[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:59.400]   what happens every time your episode it's like what i it was like five years
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.640]   ago and a hundred ed characters ago wait until your
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:06.600]   my age happens with every movie who's he what did he say why is he there
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:12.760]   who's that every every show why did he shoot that arrow
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:18.120]   who shot he did what it's a real challenge with this one though i mean
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:22.920]   how many episodes i mean i'm trying to actually probably i bet has like
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:27.000]   notebooks and maps i know i know i know i know about
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.600]   and uh and i just can't remember that far back
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.440]   uh i won't go into a deep i don't want to spoil anybody who has
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:38.280]   something watching i don't want to spoil anyone i know i wish you know
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.640]   i got to do one of those podcasts where it's a spoiler cast and you can talk
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.760]   freely because none of our shows are we allowed to talk about this stuff
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.000]   because we're you know our audience is full of the kind of people say
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.960]   spoiler alert no spoilers it's so good this season it's really great
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:02.280]   i think it's the best season yet i agree well especially after last week
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.560]   okay i think last week's episode is one of the best in the series theory
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:10.440]   right over the top yeah it's one of the best but i heard the couple were kind of
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.960]   were kind of weak is that true the first one was exposition but that's every
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.600]   year every season they do get every year they got to reset it all up they
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.160]   have to yeah so there's a lot of exposition and
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:23.000]   Cersei standing at the map saying i'm gonna take this all over
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.440]   and all that stuff she had Leo no it's spoilers just spoilers that's not a
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.920]   spoiler you didn't know from day one that Cersei was thinking i'm gonna take
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.800]   this all this all mine maybe i want that iron throne that's mine
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:41.000]   well i don't know how it's gonna end nobody does because we're off book
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.680]   so off book it's a mystery we don't know how it's gonna end but uh i can tell
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.400]   you one thing if Cersei's looking for a job she should go to zippracruder.com
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.720]   great straight segue Leo welcome one
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.560]   why yeah yeah really good a plus 10 out of 10
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.280]   couldn't even do that with a straight face zipp

[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.880]   to go i'll tell you why as a hire as somebody who does hiring i love it because

[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:19.800]   it's really the challenges it's like a needle in a haystack how do you find
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.760]   them what job sites are they haunting or what so where do you reach them you
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:28.360]   know where are they zippracruder solves that you post once on zippracruder

[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.560]   that because she's uh she's a recruiter so she probably really like that
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.080]   she know I bet you she knows about it uh recruiters probably yeah i'm sure she
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:29.160]   knows yeah all about it so HBO if this is actually a new trend and
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:32.280]   I don't think sony started I really think korea hacked sony I think that was
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.760]   korea I think that was really a political job but might have opened the eyes of
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.440]   other hackers saying you know there's probably money to be made of course
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:44.440]   remember the production company that did some of the netflix originals got
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.520]   hacked they got the net they got the oranges and new black but they kind of
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.120]   blew it because they got all but the last two episodes right
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.840]   and they said hey netflix if you don't pay us we're gonna release them and
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:59.560]   netflix said because who cares about them it's the last two episodes everybody's
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.680]   gonna watch it anyway if you don't have you're gonna subscribe to netflix
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.520]   subscribe effect it's the best possible publicity
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:10.840]   you can watch every friend the dark overlord the dark over that's right you do
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:15.240]   a very good dark overlord by the way so is it you think it's the dark over
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.920]   yeah you think it's we won't we won't do a reprise of that unless it comes up
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:22.680]   but do you but she does an excellent dark did you ever hear from the dark
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:26.520]   overlord after mocking i never did i never did mocking him
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.200]   he probably subscribes to my tiny letter
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:35.160]   and i think he's the dark overlord and he's right in and out
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:40.440]   i love you so uh they got some scripts they didn't get the
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:44.520]   video of game of thrones they got i think it was the video too
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.600]   oh did they this is it's like a terabyte and a half of data
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:53.240]   it's a lot of data that's not even one episode of
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.680]   the game of thrones i mean i don't know i mean if they're sending around a
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.880]   couple of like advanced screeners oh well that would be interesting
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:05.160]   that big i like those files aren't going to be that big so i i don't know
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.680]   they uh this is uh so they apparently aren't do have emails
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:13.080]   you know personal data which might be more compelling frankly the hbo
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:18.280]   um in a five-minute video letter from somebody calling themselves mr
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:23.400]   smith uh to uh hbo chief executive richard pepler
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.280]   the hackers told the company to pay within three days or they would put
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.640]   online yeah i guess so the hbo shows and confidential corporate data they
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:34.280]   claim to have stolen but this was like a week ago right
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:38.440]   yeah i also want to add that mashable has that video access to this
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.320]   can i watch it so you can watch the the ransom message
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:48.840]   purportedly sent to hbo ceo richard pepler and um we
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:53.640]   have what we believe is uh his full contact list from his phone
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.520]   um and and there were a lot of other documents you know how did you get
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:01.160]   that well so the hackers have been in touch with
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:07.160]   some members of the press and they've um released small batches of
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:11.720]   of the total 1.5 terabytes that they believe to or that they um
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:16.840]   allegedly have so um you know is this a video or is this your video of
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.960]   the video no no this is their this is raw video from
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.800]   this uh data leak and they put piano music in it
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:29.480]   they put the game of thrones soundtrack so i don't watch game of thrones but uh
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.240]   what someone told me this i know i know i've gotten a lot of that
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:36.440]   and i'll actually actually would you do the honors here and uh can you can you

[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.680]   the honor to inform you on behalf of my colleague that we can
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:12.680]   desperately reach into a huge network we are glad to say
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:17.080]   that in a complicated cyber operation infiltration to your network accomplished
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.760]   and we obtain the most valuable information
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.320]   we confess that hbo is one of our difficult targets to deal with but we
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:30.520]   succeeded it took about six months oh my god
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:34.200]   i should stop there uh not there yeah i can't do any more
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:38.760]   so yeah they they say uh wait wait a minute how about this
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:43.640]   paragraph really makes it exciting start with start with now can you see that
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.800]   yeah now we have your precious data which
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.560]   cost you millions of dollars thank you sir too
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:56.840]   deduced as one berry season one what's berry for your for
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:01.880]   room 104 season one bollars season three vice principal season two
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.040]   steve instagram chakubitry a world in disarray
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:15.320]   tour de farvisy defiant ones and etc they wanted six six we six months worth of
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:21.800]   their salary in bitcoin right but what is there what is there what i mean
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:25.400]   their salary what is their salary how is that this message
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:31.640]   the message is so long and so dumb so is it about six million dollars uh
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.040]   six million dollars they say they claim they make a million dollars a month
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:40.200]   yeah crazy i know these guys don't seem like the
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:44.520]   sharpest tools in the hacker show i think it's dark overlord
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:48.760]   and i think you humiliated him so badly actually that he wants to call
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:54.600]   himself something else now mr smith he says you can't mock me as mr smith
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.720]   oh by the way good to know we are white hats you must trust us
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.920]   unbelievable hb o said oh if your white hats will offer you they offered
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.840]   them what a quarter of a million dollars as a uh like a bug bounty
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:12.120]   and they were i don't i don't know if they i think they refuse to pay that
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:17.240]   that's less than one week's salary yeah it's not oh it's not enough
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.560]   not enough you have three days to make the decision so
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:26.840]   decide wisely uh yeah so so since then i think they've
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:31.000]   actually dumped a little bit more data including
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.080]   a couple of episodes from um the upcoming season of per beer enthusiasm
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.840]   so i think that broke today if i'm not mistaken like this afternoon season
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:43.320]   nine and was it is it uh is it a video it's actual video
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.200]   yes i haven't had a chance to look at that
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:51.080]   set of data but yeah that that's what bloomberg reported earlier today
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:56.520]   uh and hb o's response is no we're not going to give you the money
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.560]   uh so hb o's been slow to comment i mean we included a statement that
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.280]   essentially says you know they're working at the fbi they
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:07.720]   really don't want to talk about a pending investigation etc etc
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:11.800]   um but they were they would not verify
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.800]   the message that we published so they wouldn't you know tell us whether
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:21.640]   it was in fact sent to their ceo and i think they're playing their cards very
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.360]   close to their chest is is just an easy way to say it they're not really
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:28.360]   saying too much about this hack so many charons said we should name this
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.480]   hack what'll laugh
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.600]   yeah that's good the letter ends with maybe ashley just one more
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.560]   if i might do we have to pay you extra do we have to pay sag
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:42.520]   scale for the i feel like now i i feel like scale next time
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.640]   next time third time two it's first two times this you could
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.640]   tap hardly be fine and then after that it's a i'll do this i'm cheaper
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.960]   there are two mottos which one is remembered winter is coming hb o is
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.680]   falling or winter is coming hb o is standing and ever lasting
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:03.240]   as architect said in matrix two all right now showing they have no taste at
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:09.560]   all the problem is choice good luck to hb o
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.080]   in other news rogu deer attacks innocent man in a parking lot
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:18.920]   i think hb o's best strategy with this is just to kind of
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.040]   would do exactly what they're doing which is like hang back
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.240]   and let these guys prove whether they're idiots or not like
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.160]   they're probably idiots and honestly like even if they leak scripts or
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:33.160]   whatever it is like game of the most week was still the most highest
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:36.120]   rated show on television i mean yeah
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.280]   incidentally it is both the most highest rated show on television and the most
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.880]   pirated show on television already so that just it doesn't matter in other
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.280]   words right yeah i didn't know that statistics i mean
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.720]   we wrote an interest or one of our reporters wrote an interesting story
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:57.320]   that posited the question um do you pay the ransom in situations like this you
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.040]   know what are the upsides and what are the downsides and it gets into
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.800]   some of the game theory that these companies have to deal with when they're
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:08.360]   deciding to negotiate with hackers or at least address some of the problems
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.080]   that uh that that come up when someone steals as much as
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:16.680]   a terabyte or more of of your information so
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:21.320]   you know is there you guys like do you think that hb o under any circumstance
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:25.000]   should pay this ransom is there is there no
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.720]   never pay their answer never negotiate with terrorists they should listen to
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.240]   their own content that they put on the inner that they put online and
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.720]   broadcast out never negotiate with terrorists it doesn't even work half the
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:41.800]   time they take the money and then they're like sorry well at least at all anyway
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.160]   yeah well but but the sony hack i think the the
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:49.000]   you know it shows you what can happen when you don't negotiate with terrorists
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.520]   right so there was actually quite a there was a lot of money that was lost
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.840]   there were um you know people that lost their jobs they obviously the
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:00.840]   the movie the dictator didn't have a successful rollout the interview
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.280]   interview i'm sorry the interview i don't want sung young moon whatever his
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:08.440]   name coming after us now just uh yeah yeah
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.880]   the interview not they's not a dictator he's uh
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.880]   our leader but michael is and there's something to be said about the fact that
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.520]   that particular situation was more of like you like we were saying like a
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:25.320]   government sponsored thing to keep a movie from coming out like it's
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.080]   sort of a like it's a little bit of a different situation than a group of
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.600]   third party hackers somewhere in the world going hey let's just go back hb o
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.440]   and hold the carol hollywood a little bit though because this is it appears now
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.840]   that hollywood is being targeted yeah yeah i'm sure of course
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.720]   you know yeah you know so we can't say definitively that this is not a
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.520]   nation state hack right like uh no one knows the source of this
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:55.960]   or the source of i am mr smith and i am king john's little brother
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:59.560]   just to i agree but it's just i mean
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:02.520]   there's you'll have you anybody who pays this
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.600]   you know anybody who pays a ransom has no guarantee of that data continuing to
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.760]   be safe sure but like let's say game of the last
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.920]   episode of game of thrones goes online tonight or tomorrow
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.360]   you know then what i mean isn't that a huge opportunity
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.320]   or i don't know if the right term is opportunity cost but but
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:26.680]   doesn't hb o risk losing some of the zero risk
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:31.880]   i i don't i don't know every single hb o every single hb o fan
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:36.040]   will avoid it as a spoiler or even if they watch it they will absolutely
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:39.080]   watch the last episode and nobody's gonna cancel an hb o
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:43.720]   subscription because they saw the last episode on the internet
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.760]   yeah and how many how many new subscriptions are they expecting in the
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:51.320]   next week anyway exactly and what percentage would be affected by some
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:56.040]   uh you know dark net version of the of the show being available in
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.680]   awesome as download if you're clever enough with bit
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:01.960]   i think i think the real risk is not the shows but the
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:06.760]   individual at personal information it's email if i'm richard peplers like
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.760]   yeah and if there's a richard pepler you know saying in an email all that
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.560]   tary and lana stirs too short or whatever
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:17.080]   uh that could be embarrassing in fact that's what cost
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.680]   uh a brian sony the cost right any past while any past
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.080]   scholar job so it was those emails but surely hb o has a pretty good idea
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.640]   what's in their own emails right so i i i might have said unless there's
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.760]   something explosive they're not they're not going to negotiate personal
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.800]   phone numbers of actors no big deal you pay a little money you get the actors
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.800]   all the change their numbers that's not a big deal
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.880]   right uh if there were i can't you know unless there's
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.360]   unless there's nude well even if there are nude photos of
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:47.480]   circe lannister what are they going to do is shame okay yes
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:50.520]   what shame that happened last year there's nothing else i was
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:55.720]   in the show yeah yeah uh there's nothing they can gain out of
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.200]   game but they just like network television that's different because you
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.480]   know those people are naked yeah i would respect a little bit because
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:04.120]   what you're saying implies that there are no
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:07.400]   there's no risk like this this hack is meaningless and that there are no
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.160]   risks involved in this hack which is i think a little bit overstated right
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.920]   like there is some money to be lost from hb o and you already said this is the
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.320]   most pirated television show in the world or i i think was
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.240]   was said and so you know if that's the case then um
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:26.680]   then you know maybe there are more people that would watch a leaked
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.560]   episode than then we realize and i'm sure there are
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:33.880]   but i'm sure there are but i mean but there but those people here's my
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.120]   argument is that those people who are watching leaked
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.720]   episodes are already torrenting hb o and by the way
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:43.560]   they're the biggest fans now maybe maybe they don't buy hb o but if they're
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:46.040]   not they weren't buying it before either probably right
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.160]   because they're right that's my that's my that's my i think that those people are
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:53.480]   already torrenting television and if you're a big fan i think
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.520]   a not insignificant number of them probably still pay for hb o the only
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.240]   people who don't are people who can't afford it
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:02.040]   and so they justify saying well i can't afford it but i still own game of
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:05.480]   thrones fan but i think if you're a real fan and you can't afford it you
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:08.280]   pay for it because you want to support hb o i don't
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.160]   yeah i mean i'm sure there's consequences there's not six million
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:15.960]   dollars worth of consequences and right more to the point the larger risk is
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:21.160]   encouraging more attacks right yeah i i can't believe that i mean
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.320]   bigger risk is that six million dollars is paying six million dollars is opening
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.480]   a door to a lot of other people stealing your stuff and saying well you paid
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:32.840]   these guys why not pass oh no i i think it's six million
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:37.480]   dollars buys an awful lot of network hardening and uh you know
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.160]   fantastic and other kinds of security measures that might actually make a
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.480]   significant difference in preventing future attacks
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.720]   actually one of the reasons one of the reason you passed cal had to had to
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:52.200]   quit was because sony did such a crappy job of protecting their network
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:56.760]   even in the face of multiple threats and they knew that it was a problem and
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:59.320]   they'd said nah we don't care about security that was a
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:05.880]   spectacularly bad setup at sony yeah so that was part of their problem yeah
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:09.400]   yeah i just think that you know there has to be a circumstance in this hb o
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.680]   like if the hackers truly have 1.5 terabytes of data
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:17.160]   there has to be a scenario where this costs hb o more than six million
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:20.120]   dollars and it's just something worth considering but
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.760]   i would agree for the most part you don't know you don't negotiate with
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:28.200]   terrorists i think that you would only encourage people to to do this type of
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:31.800]   to commit this type of crime more frequently
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:37.240]   but i think you know in if you're evaluating the economic
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.160]   um repercussions of this there has to be a scenario where
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.600]   this costs hb o much more than six million dollars because i'm pretty sure in the
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:50.840]   sony hack they lost more than that amount i i would think i don't i don't
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.680]   know exactly what it cost them but my guess is that it was more than six
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.440]   million oh yeah oh god there was hundreds there was no
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.240]   attempt to collect a ransom in the sony case though was there
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:05.480]   no uh that's actually a good point i think there was uh but i think it was a
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.520]   half-hearted attack really yeah no it was it was don't release the
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:11.960]   movie that was what that was what the ransom was it was
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:15.720]   don't just don't release the interview yeah which frankly would have been a
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:19.800]   boon for everyone and concern i know i feel like i feel like they could have
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.760]   very easily went everything by being like well it's not a really good move
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:26.120]   ill we just won't release it anyway why didn't they do that with the emoji
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.000]   movie i i think right this the one good thing you say about the sony hack is
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.520]   it got a lot more box office for the interview i think far more people saw
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:40.040]   that i watched it because of the hack then didn't you know yeah yeah now here's a
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:44.440]   bigger concern the white house we know the white house security practices
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:47.640]   are perhaps less than perfect there's a guy
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.600]   from the uk and he calls himself email prankster
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.360]   who has had email conversations with
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:58.440]   anthony scaramucci before he got fired that wouldn't be a weird thing except he
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.360]   was posing as rince prebus he is all this may be laugh
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:07.480]   he has sent emails to tom bocer eric trump
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:15.080]   he has posed as jared kushner the the homeland security advisor
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:18.120]   said he thought it was he was talking with jared kushner it wasn't it was this
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.000]   prankster he gave him his personal email address
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.120]   saying jared anytime you need me just email me at home
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:31.480]   this is the guy in charge of sight of the cyber
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:38.920]   of our security yeah uh uh he should be using valor mail
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:43.960]   yeah exactly i really love that that guy didn't even bother the prankster
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:47.720]   didn't even bother masking the email address like that's
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:51.000]   my favorite he was like i'm not even gonna bother
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.920]   just to see and like they just even just used like a gmail account or
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:58.840]   something and he just called it right at gmail dot com
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:02.360]   right now at gmail at gmail or something like that
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:07.640]   but i prevent a lay now oh my god he made up new email addresses on gmail
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:11.880]   yahoo and mail dot com he didn't bother faking anything
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.880]   they didn't bother checking the guy in charge of homeland security
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:20.280]   cyber security didn't even he just oh yeah must be jared
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:25.880]   because it says so so this guy has actually been going around
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:28.760]   uh targeting a bunch of different people he got
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:34.840]   like the CEO of goldman um and uh barkley's bank in the uk and some other
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:39.240]   banks like a bunch of bank chiefs some uh british government officials he's
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:42.680]   fooled a ton of people using exactly the same playbook
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:48.280]   is it illegal i don't think so he hasn't been
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.520]   prosecuted eric trump said i'm gonna get the fbi on him but you know
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:57.640]   you you could use maybe the can spam act which says that you have to have a
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.400]   legitimate a legitimate like you have to say who you really are in the
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:07.000]   front field of a message but he's oh that again that's a thing
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.880]   it's he's not they're not really he's not spamming anybody he had a
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:12.360]   conversation it's just he's capturing someone
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:17.640]   caffering legal is caffering legal no uh
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.840]   oh on its face i think it's what you do with it i think it's like when it's
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:24.360]   malicious yeah exactly like if you steal someone's identity yes that's a
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:28.520]   break another law that's right or if you get them to download some
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:31.080]   malware and you in fact their computer with something
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.800]   right right but i just embarrassing people i'm not sure
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.760]   yeah no i don't think that's illegal i hope that's not illegal
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:42.440]   i was gonna say he's gonna find out soon enough
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:45.320]   so far there's been no action to ashley yeah
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:49.480]   yeah maybe not illegal because it's hilarious
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:54.600]   i think this is hilarious uh we have some good news to celebrate the
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:47:00.360]   eff continues to beat the podcast troll i we we received a letter from
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.760]   personal audio some years ago asking us for i think two and a half million
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:07.640]   dollars uh that was a mistake because you're
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:09.960]   supposed to if you're let me just a little tip
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:13.160]   for uh patent trolls out there you should always ask for an amount that's
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:17.000]   less than it would cost to defend the case and in two and a half million
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.600]   is considerably more even than the highest estimate
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:24.600]   uh they did settle with a number of companies which gave them a bank role
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:29.880]   enough of a bank role to appeal so uh the eff of one with the patent and
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.160]   trademark office they got it them to overturn the patent so
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:36.280]   personal audio appealed it to the u.s. court of appeals
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:39.720]   and for the federal circuit which reels it's the washington d c court that rules
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.560]   mostly on patent law they've ruled also now in favor of the electronic frontier
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:47.080]   foundation i would say yay it's over
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.640]   uh but they could still go to the supreme court if they
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.400]   wanted to no word about whether personal audio will continue appealing but that's
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.960]   that's one that really sent a chill a few years ago
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:00.360]   they sued adam arola they sued uh npr sued a lot of
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.160]   companies looking for some money and apparently it already won money
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.920]   from apple and others uh in other patent troll
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:13.080]   uh cases uh good news for uh uh a good man and a good friend mike maznick of
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:17.960]   tech dirt uh he was being sued by a guy who claims
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:22.600]   to have invented email maznick uh poopooed the claim in fairly
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:28.440]   strong terms so uh this guy sued using the by the way the same
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:32.600]   attorney who represented a hulk hogan in his case against galker
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:35.720]   uh as you imagine uh mike tech dirt is not a huge
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:40.120]   company and probably doesn't have very deep pockets uh but fortunately
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:44.120]   uh number of people have come to their aid in a quarter million dollar defense
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.640]   fund has been raised from of all people the charles coke foundation
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.800]   craigslist founders craig new mark union square ventures automatic the word
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:55.640]   press paren our sponsor and the freedom of the press uh foundation
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:58.440]   more than a quarter million dollars that should be enough
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:02.200]   or at least it should help in mike maznick's uh defense
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.320]   mike said the lawsuits are already taking a massive toll on us and our ability to
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.520]   function and report and it i i have to say it's a fairly
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:11.960]   frivolous lawsuit this guy's claims are you know
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:16.440]   uh completely nonsense leo that that guy actually
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:21.720]   filed the same lawsuit against uh gizmodo or against galker media
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.960]   um and while it was like a a writer to the or a side
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:30.040]   side show to the main hulk hogan one but he won
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.160]   like that's one of the yeah one of the reasons he's going after tech dirt is
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.400]   because he won against galker media because they had no defenses they had
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:39.640]   already been blown away by oh it's interesting
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.080]   you know they would have been yeah well i was there at the time i was
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.720]   working for gizmodo um and it was you know there was a lot of it was a
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:50.600]   painful time i think for a lot of the reporters there because there were
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:52.840]   only a couple of articles that had to be removed
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.480]   following the hogan lawsuit and one of them was
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:50:00.520]   this article that called into question this individual who claims to have
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:04.440]   invented email um when you know every computer
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:08.040]   expert that we that that these reporters could contact
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:12.360]   with said otherwise and so um so anyways yeah it was a really painful
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:17.320]   time and you know and it's not there you go yeah that that's um so we're
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:20.920]   right now we're looking at the page on gizmodo and um the story had to be
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:25.000]   removed and galker media had a really strict policy about never removing
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.040]   any of the stories that were written um especially if they were true and so
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.760]   um so in this case um yeah it was it was it was rough and it's kind of
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:40.680]   it's sad to see that this this is continuing that they paid galker paid
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:45.160]   him three quarters of a million dollars geez
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.640]   wow and and so i will say if you go to the internet archive
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:52.600]   if you're interested in this story i would encourage you to go to the internet
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.520]   archive and um google this person's name who i don't want to
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:59.240]   you know whose name i don't really want to say on air
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:03.400]   but um but anyways you can read the full article
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.120]   via the internet archive and i would encourage you to do that because it's
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:10.200]   a really good one yeah and the person that wrote it is
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:14.920]   now working at the new york times well there you go
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:19.320]   yeah i you know i don't want him to sue me but uh
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:25.000]   if you look at the facts of the case uh mike clearly is in the right so uh
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.520]   we'll see what happens but i'm glad he's got a defense fund but but you could see
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:33.000]   a three a quarter million dollars may not be may not be enough wow
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.200]   yeah and what a huge claim too to have invented email is is so
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:43.800]   it's such a substantial claim and uh it's also demonstrably i mean you can look at
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:48.440]   history and see where he he says he invented email but it sounds like he
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:51.000]   feels like i think he genuinely feels like he invented but he ended
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.920]   invented it kind of independently after it had already been invented
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:58.040]   uh in the 1970s or something is when he came on
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:03.080]   right so sorry it's odd yeah so yeah and the and what i what this individual
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:06.440]   claims is that he invented it as a teenager or maybe even
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:10.840]   uh younger than a teenager so i don't know it's it's a very absurd that i thought
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:13.720]   uh before i knew email existed i thought of it
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:19.720]   i mean you it's not you invented it in a school project i thought of this i
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:24.760]   thought of the snuggie too but yeah here we are there you go there you go yeah
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:30.280]   i i i i thought that the ipad way back in yeah the right i yeah i duct taped my phone
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:38.680]   to my clipboard and it's practically the same practically the same exactly the same thing
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:43.560]   it's i mean seriously yeah uh snapchat oh we're not really
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:49.720]   snapchat sad story uh snapchat stock goes down 17% revenue and daily user growth
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:55.160]   they did not have good quarterly results uh even with a hot dog filter
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:53:00.360]   uh they just they just you know it seems to be instagrams eating their lunch
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:03.880]   or maybe yeah the kids are just tired of snapchat
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:10.040]   well instagram is i mean the thing is is he blatantly copy and companies in this
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:17.240]   type of business model and and and you have a bigger built-in user base i mean it's
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.520]   anybody who's on facebook or joins facebook is
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:24.840]   encouraged to join instagram it's like it's so integrated that it's easy actually
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:29.400]   wall street journal wrote this article the new copycats have facebook swashes
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:33.560]   competition for startups uh this is Betsy Morris and the
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:40.840]   deepa cithra ma citha raman um but microsoft did that for years and everybody knew it
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:45.320]   it was in gulf and devour you know and uh they got away with it most of the time
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:48.040]   they'd occasionally get sued but they got away with it most of the time
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:51.560]   but but they were eventually brought in front of congress because there were
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:56.920]   monopoly accusations if i remember correctly yes i remember that yeah
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:01.800]   yeah so i mean i was young so i read about it but it was it was in like it was
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.480]   1998 the department of justice uh said you're a monopoly and you're using your
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:10.760]   monopoly power to with the browser to force uh netscape out of business
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:14.760]   essentially and uh it went on for a long time and in fact they lost the department
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:19.000]   of justice got a consent decree and for a long time there was a monitor in
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.760]   microsoft watching their behavior they had similar problems in the EU
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:28.440]   and also lost there do you think that there's a lot harder they have some
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.280]   harder rules there yeah is there overlap between what was happening then and
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:35.080]   what's happening now in social media because it seems like
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:41.080]   facebook is able to squash any form of competition at this point you know i
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:44.760]   think um snapchat's not the only social media company that's struggling to
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.280]   compete with facebook right i mean twitter is another prime example and
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:52.600]   sure there are plenty of others that um that aren't publicly traded that that
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:57.320]   are having trouble so you know i wasn't around i mean i was i was
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:02.520]   using computers but i was still too young to really understand what was going
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:08.280]   on with netscape and internet explorer and and windows and um all and that
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.000]   i'll tell you the difference you want to know what the difference was
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.160]   yeah at that time the department of justice
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.520]   prosecuted trusts and pro they had anti-trust prosecution i don't see i
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:21.960]   doubt very much there'll be any any trust in prosecution
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.840]   and there hasn't been an on while and i doubt very much they'll be for at least
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:27.800]   the next four years there's just no interest in doing that
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:32.120]   so it was very clear cut with microsoft too i mean there were basically two
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:36.120]   choices for computers you know if you wanted to use a personal computer and
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.760]   microsoft controlled 95 percent of them plus right and in 96 microsoft
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:45.320]   okay microsoft gave zapple 150 million dollars
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.120]   did not not because they loved apple just to keep them alive so there'd be some
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:52.120]   competition exactly whereas with facebook i mean even though they
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:54.920]   reached two billion people and they have an enormous reach
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:58.600]   there's still significant alternatives you can point to twitter you can point
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:01.880]   to linkedin you know snap for that matter
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:04.840]   and then the second thing is like you have to catch them doing something to
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:08.280]   abuse that monopoly power it's you know
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.560]   like forcing people to install instagram instead of snap
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.560]   um man it's not going to happen in the u_s it might happen in uh in europe
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:19.800]   there's certainly a lot of activity there
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.400]   uh but i at this point i know i i i feel like
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.960]   the microsoft had nothing on facebook facebook is
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:32.520]   so dominant or just talking about like it's funny like two what two or three
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:36.760]   stories a bit about these huge companies just eating everybody else's lunches
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:40.120]   right amazon google facebook like it's just the thing
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:44.200]   facebook can do that google maybe can't do and microsoft can't do is really point
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:48.360]   to other social media so they say what are you talking about we don't own the
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:52.200]   market look at twitter look at uh look at google plus you guys
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:57.880]   right there wait for everybody what do you have competition
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:03.720]   uh bitcoin on that side too bitcoin is now over four thousand dollars
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:07.400]   uh it's finally reached the point where i actually started to download my bitcoin
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.720]   wallet 128 gigabytes worth actually that's the whole blockchain but try and
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:15.000]   they recover my bitcoin look at this and this is
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:21.080]   an interesting story because it's after the fork after the bitcoin cash fork
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:25.320]   a couple of weeks ago and i think you can now declare victory for the original
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:29.640]   bitcoin that the bitcoin cash has not taken off
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:33.080]   though it's all up to the miners
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:37.880]   and uh well we'll see we'll watch with interest but the boy bitcoin is is very
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:41.720]   very strong these days our show today let me wrap it up with the
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:46.680]   final commercial and the final words from our fabulous panel of experts
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:52.920]   Ashley isketha from cnet from mashable.com uh michael munyaz
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:56.440]   newyaz uh deputy tech editor there and from the
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:00.920]   brand new valley girl i mean valley male billin 20
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.920]   head of communications over there this is a system that validates your email
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:12.360]   what how does that what does it do so that people receiving your email
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.200]   can be sure that it comes from you very important businesses would use this
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:19.800]   right more than yes i think you got to call the white house
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.840]   although the white house yes you got you got to get right on the uh the
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.520]   white house let me just see i i think this one would be really good

[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:57.480]   record has critical errors you get an a for effort i try at least i have
[01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:04.440]   us as pf record i'm trying i have no visibility in the third-party email
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:06.280]   services i'm partially optimized to control
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:09.880]   deliverability i'm totally unprotected against impersonation attacks
[01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:16.040]   so go on spammers just use it use it all you want
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:20.200]   our show today brought to you my my doorbell at least my my stoop is safe
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:24.360]   my front stoop completely protected by the ring video door but i put that in a
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:27.400]   couple of years ago i've told you about it then i'm not a handyman it was
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:32.680]   easy to install i replaced my old doorbell and then i paired the ring up to my
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:36.840]   internet my Wi-Fi and now it's got a camera microphone and speaker when
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:40.360]   somebody in motion sensors when somebody walks by my door i can see
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:43.880]   them when somebody rings my doorbell i can talk to them i can say
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:47.960]   hey what do you want or leave that package or i'm in the bathtub
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:52.040]   don't break in right now they did an interesting study ring gave ring door
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:55.560]   bells to 10 percent of the homes in a southern california community
[01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:01.160]   crime was reduced by half crooks do not like the ring video doorbell and they're
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:04.440]   really not going to like rings new floodlight cam
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:08.600]   i love this if you go to ring dot com slash twit you can get up to 150
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:12.440]   dollars off a ring of security kit that includes the doorbell and the floodlight
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:16.200]   cam one two or three floodlight cams the camera
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:19.480]   you've seen this before motion activated floodlights that's that's not a lot of
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:22.200]   people have that and that's actually a great convenience when you walk down
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:25.640]   you know the side alley of your house or behind your house or out by the barn
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:29.320]   if you have a barn uh i don't have a barn but if you have a barn
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:32.200]   uh the things light up because in it lets you see your way but these other
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:36.600]   thing that's there is a camera and a speaker and a microphone it's just like
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:40.280]   the ring video doorbell so you get notification even if you're not home
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:43.240]   wherever you are on your phone somebody is out back
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:47.640]   you can see them you can talk to them you can say get out of here
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:51.240]   and if they don't leave you can press a button on the app and send 110
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:58.520]   decibel alarm out into their ears and man if that doesn't scare them away
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:02.760]   i don't know what to say this is really effective in protecting your security
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:06.360]   and if you don't well you got a great HD video of them
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:10.680]   which will be helpful in prosecution later ring dot com slash
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:14.760]   twit i love these and i am a big fan you will be too i want you to go to ring
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:18.920]   dot com slash twit and save up to 150 dollars wall street journals best of
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:23.480]   ces 2017 it just gets better and better
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:28.920]   ring dot com slash twit it's very satisfying
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.560]   actually and see i because the doorbell like i know when people come and go i
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:36.760]   have a record a time record of everybody who's come and gone
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:40.040]   uh you know or even just walked by the house
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.560]   and then with the things in the back like it's very satisfying
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:47.080]   you can mostly for in our neighborhood it's it's you know
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:51.000]   deer but it's still fun to scare them away just go but i can't wait
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.880]   every if i ever get a problem can i just scare them away
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:59.640]   um let's see let's uh a couple of a couple of
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:05.880]   last uh minute uh things here the FCC is extending
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:09.960]   its comment period another two weeks that's a positive sign
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:14.680]   if you have not yet gone to go FCC yourself
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:19.400]   john alvers site where you can make your comments to the FCC to preserve net
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:23.720]   neutrality they've decided to extend it to august 30th that line was originally
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:28.280]   the 16th so we got a little reprieve that's actually
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:30.840]   go do that by the way the broad ministry did not
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:35.000]   want to extend so maybe there's a chink in the armor
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:41.160]   maybe maybe there's a little opportunity yeah go do that and then if you have
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:44.280]   a couple extra bucks a month donated to the EFF
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:47.400]   i said i mean really so hundred bucks a month yes
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.840]   i'm thrilled to do it yeah i've a recurring yeah i've a recurring donation
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.560]   i have my t-shirt my t-shirt it's like they're doing God's work
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.240]   trying to protect us and you can find out more to EFF.org by the way
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:02.200]   that's good thank you Ashley give good to give them a little
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:06.840]   a little plug the guy who wrote the original NIST document on passwords
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:12.520]   says i'm sorry i'm wrong and it and it's been it's been plaguing you all this
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:17.880]   time this bill burr wrote it in 2003 he's the guy who said use numbers
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:21.880]   obscure characters capital letters but worse
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.480]   said change it all a lot every three months or
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:29.480]   or more every 90 days or more and that's why you
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:33.960]   keep getting notices from your company saying it's time to change your password
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:39.560]   again it's so frustrating the NIST has finally updated this
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:43.240]   uh saying there's no good reason to change your passwords regularly
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:45.720]   don't unless you think you've been compromised
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:50.520]   uh mr burr he's now 72 and retired said much of what i did i now regret
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:57.880]   oh come on no no you don't say that don't say that
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:05.160]   terribly you know what i bet he uses inkwell a lot
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:10.280]   uh so if if you haven't read the new NIST recommendations i recommend you do
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:15.480]   and more importantly if your it guy or your cis admins
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:19.320]   are requiring that you change your password every three months
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:23.800]   the company i work for on the radio show does it drives me nuts
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:26.840]   send them the new NIST regulations or not regulations not
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:30.520]   regulations recommendations and let him know he doesn't have to do that
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.760]   anymore use a password manager that's what i hate
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:40.280]   that's the obvious smart answer yeah let the password manager do its job
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:43.160]   generate long passwords the longer the better
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:46.360]   uh and you only have to remember one password the password manager's password
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:50.600]   a plus that's the best way i've been trying to get family members little by
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:55.080]   little over to password managers and it's a little inconvenient at first but then
[02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:58.920]   once you get the hang of it it's so much better yes
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:05.640]   and finally in the annals of bio hacking you know that we've seen a
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:11.000]   attacks that would compromise a say a pdf or a jpeg and use flaws in the
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.240]   software that renders the jpeg of the pdf to hack your system those are
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:17.880]   well-known attacks one of the few attacks that data can actually
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:21.720]   infect your system bio hackers have figured out
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:25.720]   how to synthesize dna
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:30.920]   that will infect computers running sequencing software and let them take
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:33.880]   it over they're going to present the usenix conference on
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:37.320]   thursday you can now pona computer
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:40.280]   with malicious dna
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:45.800]   wow oh and they were able to put a movie on a strand of dna so it makes sense
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:50.920]   some sense i think that the the the tech revolution we've seen over the last
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:53.160]   20 years the internet revolution nothing
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:56.840]   nothing compared to what's about to happen with crisper
[02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:01.640]   uh i mean the bio revolution ai robotics
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:06.360]   and it's happening so fast that we just there's no way we can prepare for it
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.840]   just buckle your seat belts it's going to be a
[02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:13.160]   bumpy rock wow grim grimly oh it's going to be fun
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:16.040]   no it's going to be fun and at the end we're all being jars our brains will be
[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:19.000]   in jars and actually be a robot should be our robot
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.440]   and i'll either have my very own or i will be
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:25.800]   some version of rosy the robot from the jets i think with that
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:30.120]   from dana and put new saline in our jars and keep us happy
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:34.200]   and the only thing we'll be using our dna for is like watching old youtube
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:37.800]   videos which will be encoded on them right yeah right well you've already
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:41.800]   they've already hacked d leo's dna they got into 23 and me and they're like
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:45.720]   we got to get in here you know how you can tell dna you can tell the clones
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:49.080]   use the inkwell filter
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.880]   that's how you can tell that's a dead giveaway
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:55.320]   hey you guys are great thank you so much for being here michael noonya is what are
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:57.720]   you working on uh right now at mashable is
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:02.040]   depot i'm so i'm not allowed to say but i can promise you that it's really
[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:05.960]   exciting and uh you should just stay tuned please keep checking in mashable
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.840]   tech uh we cover a lot of gadgets and hopefully we'll start doing some
[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:11.960]   investigative stuff pretty soon so oh how exciting
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:16.520]   you're going to get to do that yeah definitely i wouldn't have come here
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:20.600]   if otherwise so um so yeah so we're we're definitely you know
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:23.480]   there's there's more going on than i'm able to talk about but certainly we're
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:26.840]   watching the hbo thing very closely and a couple of other things now i did not
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:30.360]   do your story about uh elan musk who created an
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:36.280]   ai that beat the world champion dota dota two player at his own game i did not
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.040]   do this only because i don't understand why that's a big deal wouldn't you
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.840]   expect a computer to be better than humans at computer
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:46.600]   games you would think but i like the way that it was
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:49.640]   described uh or the way that i understood it was that
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:52.920]   this is like it's like four-dimensional chess or something like that you know
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:56.920]   this is um it's it's like a board game like chess
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.960]   or there's so much strategy i don't know dota too well enough there's so much
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:03.400]   strategy in it that this is a strategy game
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:08.440]   yes not how fast you click that that's right yeah it's not it's not only how
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:13.080]   fast you click but it's also where you're putting different pieces and so
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:16.760]   you know it's like a very um it's like a very fast game of chess essentially you
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:21.000]   have different tiers of players and they can be moved around the board more
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:25.000]   dynamically than in chess and so my understanding is that this is
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.040]   actually quite hard and uh and this is um this achievement was actually
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:34.760]   something very substantial uh beyond what i fully understand to be totally
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:37.800]   honest um i just understand it as a as a tough game
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:40.920]   and uh and a like and a tough challenge for AI
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:44.920]   somebody was at karsten was saying the real takeaway from the story is that
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:48.920]   dota too the purse was 10 million dollars it's like
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:52.920]   this is big business and look at the spn too this weekend yeah
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:55.240]   yeah and there's an e-sports channel that runs it
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:58.280]   i was actually my whole weekend was spent watching the
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:01.640]   overwatch uh the quarterfinals or whatever from Blizzcon
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:04.920]   i did overwatch i like overwatch championship i was
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:07.800]   that's uh that's my jam that i would be doing all weekends
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:11.240]   but that's a yes a computer could win overwatch easy right because it's just
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:13.480]   about how fast you move and and proceed
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:20.280]   not versus me my friend not versus me oh what character what heroes do you like
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:26.440]   uh well i i may and as fair uh but then i play winston a lot because a lot of
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:31.880]   people in my sr rating are not very good at winston so i play winston and then
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:37.640]   i'm a pretty good zenyatta and a really like fight dirty symmetra so it's fun
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:42.280]   i love it oh watches the best so do that's interesting you do you prefer
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:47.480]   female heroes uh not necessarily uh i just um
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:50.680]   this is a really weird it's kind of can't believe i'm admitting to this on your
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:54.760]   show to so many people i used to be a professional
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:57.720]   esports player like what wait a long time ago
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:01.560]   i was even a thing i didn't know that what was my game quake
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:05.640]   i was a unreal tournament 2003 wow wow
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.360]   utk 3 and uh i i was signed a global gaming league before it was like a
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:14.360]   like it was this was a long time ago what was your handle
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:19.240]   uh it was vila from uh nordic mythology and i guess
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:23.240]   yeah harry potter so that was like a that was like a double surprise but yeah

[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:35.320]   you know um i did not set out to join a startup i in years of covering startups
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:41.720]   um i kind of had decided it the way uh when i left venture beat that that was
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:46.120]   the last thing i wanted to do uh but i did some work for these guys and uh
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:48.680]   they they seem to have their head screwed on straight it's not
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:54.120]   um it's not kind of like what you you this sort of a classic story of
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:58.200]   uh a startup where people are running around uh with barely any idea what
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:02.440]   they're doing um no i like security startups i love security startups i
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:06.440]   think i would have to say yes i'm enjoying it good

[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:21.240]   obviously pretty pretty important i i think so too Leo yes thanks for saying

[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:27.000]   communications because i don't think it's immediately obvious what this is
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000]   all about i understand but i think in general
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.800]   business doesn't know what do you mean validate my idea what do you mean
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.600]   it's a little hard to explain yeah and then you get into all these internet
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:40.120]   standards like SPF and DKIM and people get really confused so
